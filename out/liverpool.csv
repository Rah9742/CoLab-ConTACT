"Defining new dental phenotypes using 3-D image analysis to enhance discrimination and insights into biological processes.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/486/","Smith, Richard; Zaitoun, Halla; Coxon, Tom; Karmo, Mayada; Kaur, Gurpreet; Townsend, Grant; Harris, Edward F; Brook, Alan","October 2009","<h4>Aims</h4>In studying aetiological interactions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors in normal and abnormal developments of the dentition, methods of measurement have often been limited to maximum mesio-distal and bucco-lingual crown diameters, obtained with hand-held calipers. While this approach has led to many important findings, there are potentially many other informative measurements that can be made to describe dental crown morphology. Advances in digital imaging and computer technology now offer the opportunity to define and measure new dental phenotypes in 3-D that have the potential to provide better anatomical discrimination and clearer insights into the underlying biological processes in dental development. Over recent years, image analysis in 2-D has proved to be a valuable addition to hand-measurement methods but a reliable and rapid 3-D method would increase greatly the morphological information obtainable from natural teeth and dental models. Additional measurements such as crown heights, surface contours, actual surface perimeters and areas, and tooth volumes would maximise our ability to discriminate between samples and to explore more deeply genetic and environmental contributions to observed variation. The research objectives were to investigate the limitations of existing methodologies and to develop and validate new methods for obtaining true 3-D measurements, including curvatures and volumes, in order to enhance discrimination to allow increased differentiation in studies of dental morphology and development. The validity of a new methodology for the 3-D measurement of teeth is compared against an established 2-D system. The intra- and inter-observer reliability of some additional measurements, made possible with a 3-D approach, are also tested.<h4>Methods and results</h4>From each of 20 study models, the permanent upper right lateral and upper left central incisors were separated and imaged independently by two operators using 2-D image analysis and a 3-D image analysis system. The mesio-distal (MD), labio-lingual (LL) and inciso-gingival (IG) dimensions were recorded using our 2-D system and the same projected variables were also recorded using a newly developed 3-D system for comparison. Values of Pearson's correlation coefficient between measurements obtained using the two techniques were significant at the 0.01 probability level for variables mesio-distal and incisal-gingival with labio-lingual significant at the 0.05 level for the upper left side only, confirming their comparability. For both 2-D and 3-D systems the intra- and inter-operator reliability was substantial or excellent for variables mesio-distal, labio-lingual, incisal-gingival actual and projected and actual surface area. The reliability was good for inter-operator reliability measurement of the labio-lingual dimension using 3-D.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have developed a new 3-D laser scanning system that enables additional dental phenotypes to be defined. It has been validated against an established 2-D system and shown to provide measurements with excellent reliability, both within and between operators. This new approach provides exciting possibilities for exploring normal and abnormal variations in dental morphology and development applicable to research on genetic and environmental factors.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Identity Theft and Systems Theory: The Fraud Act 2006 in Perspective.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/726/","Savirimuthu, Joseph","April 2024","The Fraud Act 2006 provides us with an instrument through which we can now target emerging online criminal threats posed by identity thieves. This paper argues for a nuanced approach to the debates regarding the amenability of online criminal activity to centralised regulatory oversight. Managing risks in a decentralised and distributed network environment has frequently descended into a question of how liability rules can be harnessed to promote trust and security. We argue that a deeper understanding of the governance implications of managing complex systems is an important prerequisite to coherent policymaking. The analysis advocated in the paper has a number of implications for the way we understand and conceptualise information security governance in the online environment. We identify three. First, law is a necessary but not a sufficient governance instrument in managing the emerging threats on the Internet. Second, identity theft is a social not technologically driven problem. Third, emerging networks for information sharing, the evolution of specialised technological solutions and increased end-user participation suggest an important trend in the way online threats can be conceptualised and managed. The central thesis of the paper is that Luhmann’s ideas of autopoiesis and social systems may provide us with a better understanding of governance in the online environment than what seems to be afforded by current analysis of the Fraud Act 2006.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Synthesis and characterisation of layered hydroxy anion exchange materials.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/1362/","McIntyre, Laura J","October 2009","This thesis concerns the synthesis and characterisation of layered hydroxy anion exchange materials. The incorporation of rare-earth cations into these materials offers the potential to combine the optical, magnetic and catalytic properties of the lanthanides with the flexibility of intercalation hosts. A review of the literature surrounding intercalation chemistry and materials is presented in Chapter 1. Here the synthesis, structure and anion exchange reactions of layered hydroxides and their applications in the fields of catalysis, separation science, polymer additives and biological storage and delivery are discussed. Chapter 2 describes the hydrothermal synthesis and anion exchange capacity of new anion exchange host lattices containing the smaller lanthanide cations, with the composition Ln2(OH)5NO3•1.5H2O (Ln = Y, Gd - Lu), with Gd marking a limiting cation radius. Anion exchange reactions are facile with a wide range of organic carboxylates and sulfonates and investigations into their selectivity and optical properties have been carried out. This family has also been expanded to include Ln2(OH)5X•1.5H2O (X = Cl, Br; Ln = Y, Dy, Er, Yb) and crystal structures for orthorhombic and monoclinic Yb2(OH)5Cl•1.5H2O are reported. The findings of a time-resolved in situ X-ray powder diffraction study form the basis of Chapter 3. Three different phases with the layer composition [Yb2(OH)5]+; Yb2(OH)5NO3•1.5H2O d = 9.2 Å (1), Yb2(OH)5NO3•2H2O d = 9.4 Å (2) and Yb2(OH)5NO3•H2O d = 8.5 Å (3) were observed and shown to ultimately transform to a 3D structure Yb4O(OH)9NO3 d = 8.0 Å (4). Single crystal structures are given for phases 2 and 3, and the structure of 4 has been refined. The effects of temperature and metal concentration on phase formation have been investigated and compared with ex situ results. A full kinetic analysis is presented including the activation energy for the formation of phase 2. The values extracted indicate that the mechanism of crystallisation is phase boundary controlled. In Chapter 4 the room temperature precipitation synthesis of a related family of anion exchange host lattices with the composition, Ln2(OH)5NO3•H2O (Ln = Y, Eu–Er) and MgAl layered double hydroxides incorporating the precious metals Ru and Pd are discussed. Details of synthetic routes to the novel materials described and the methods of characterisation used are given in Chapter 5.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Development of molecular tools for the characterisation of foot-and-mouth disease virus strains circulating in Southeast Asia.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/1462/","Abdul Hamid, Nor Faizah","November 2011","Foot-and-mouth disease is an acute and contagious vesicular disease affecting wild or domesticated cloven hoofed animals. The disease is caused by Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of Aphthovirus genus within Picornaviridae family. FMDV exists as seven distinct serotypes; O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT (Southern Africa Territories) 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3, each with multiple subtypes which are not equally distributed around the world. In this study, VPI analysis of clinical samples cattle and pigs received from Southeast Asian countries namely Malaysia, Thailand, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia between 2000 to 2009 revealed seven FMDV lineages circulating in the region. The lineages were O/SEA/Mya-98, O/SEA/Cam-94, O/ME-SA/PanAsia, O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2, O/CATHAY, A/ASIA, and Asia 1. Some of these lineages were highly prevalent such as O/SEA/Mya98 and serotype A, while O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 was unique to Malaysia within Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 showed two distinct patterns of genetic relationships between viruses from Malaysia and the other neighbouring countries. These data suggest that viruses of O/SEA/Mya-98 and serotype A lineage were repeatedly introduced into the country on a yearly basis. In contrast, viruses belonging to O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 sublineage were maintained in the country to cause outbreaks in following continuous years. However, phylogenetic analysis cannot conclude the link between Malaysian isolates with those from neighbouring countries. Since Malaysia is a major beef and animal importer, the sources of these FMDVs were most likely introduced via imports of infected animals or contaminated animal products into Malaysia. In order to improve the resolution, by which the molecular epidemiology of FMDV in the region can be studied, RT-PCR protocols to amplify complete genome sequences of each lineage were developed. The protocols utilised a single set of universal primers for NSP region and specific primers sets for the capsid region. Complete genomes from representative isolates from the seven virus lineages were generated from Malaysian samples. Basic characteristic of genomes generated with this protocol were consistent with previous published sequences such as deletions at the 3A region for O/CATHAY and O/SEA/Cam-94 lineage. In addition, preliminary analysis of O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 sequence showed numerous nucleotide substitutions observed at the 5’UTR and Lpro region of genome to that of O/ME-SA/PanAsia which indicated a possible event of recombination. The O/SEA/Mya-98 protocol was proven to be robust when it was utilised to generate two complete genome sequences of O/SEA/Mya-98 viruses from outbreaks in East Asian countries, in Hong Kong SAR and Republic of Korea that have occurred during 2010. Analysis of the Hong Kong genome sequence revealed a block deletion of 70 nucleotides located within the S-fragment. Subsequent analysis showed that this feature was shared with other viruses with related VP1 sequences. The methods developed in this study provide a basis for a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity and evolution of FMDV that will hopefully develop improved epidemiological and diagnostic tools that will contribute to the existing disease control programmes in the region.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Optimizing impact assessment of entomological intervention for malaria control in an operational setting in Zambia.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3413/","Chanda, Emmanuel","June 2011","The study aimed at optimally assessing the impact of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide treated nets (ITNs) on vector species abundance, their infectivity and resistance status, and Plasmodium falciparum prevalence, malaria deaths and case fatality rates in the human population.  Malaria prevalence surveys were conducted and routine surveillance data was retrospectively analyzed. The average P. falciparum prevalence in children between the ages of 1 and 14 years was below 10% across the study period. The intervention effect was more pronounced in IRS areas than in ITNs localities but with an incremental protective effect of their combined use. Age-specific comparison showed better intervention effect on children below 5 years than older children 5 to 14 years old. While the average number of deaths and case fatality rates in children under the age of five plunged precipitately, the reductions were more significant in IRS districts than in ITNs districts. Results indicate the need for supplementing parasite prevalence survey data with routine surveillance data in low transmission intensity areas and demonstrate the significance of evidence-based age-specific deployment of interventions.   To monitor vector species abundance and infectivity, mosquitoes were collected daily using exit window traps. The three major vectors; An. gambiae s.s, An. arabiensis and An. funestus s.s, and three potential vectors of malaria, An. nili, An. rivulorum and An. funestus-like species were identified. Overall, the biggest impact of IRS and ITNs was on An. gambiae s.s, and An. funestus abundance. No An. gambiae s.s was collected in IRS localities, thus validating the fact that An. gambiae s.s and An. funestus are characteristically more amenable to control by IRS and ITNs than An. arabiensis. The transmission potential for all malaria vectors, as expressed by the calculated transmission index, was zero as none of the trapped mosquitoes tested positive for P. falciparum sporozoites. The identification of An. nili, An. rivulorum and An. funestus-like necessitate further research to determine their role in malaria transmission in the country. The low numbers of mosquitoes collected also indicate a compromise in the efficiency of exit window traps in low transmission settings, suggesting the need for their replacement with a more robust collection tool like the CDC light trap. While the persistence of An. arabiensis suggests the presence of resistance segregating in this population or, that this outdoor species is not in contact with IRS or ITNs, it could as well imply that it’s the one species perpetuating malaria transmission in these meso-to hypo- endemic areas.  To determine the impact of interventions on insecticide resistance status of malaria vectors, susceptibility assays using the WHO standard protocol were conducted in 17 localities. High levels of resistance were detected in both An, gambiae s.l and An, funestus s.l to pyrethroids and DDT but with 100% susceptibility to malathion and bendiocarb. The level of resistance was significantly higher in IRS areas than in ITN areas. These findings indicate that resistance has been selected for following extensive vector control. Resistance to both DDT and deltamethrin in IRS localities and ITN areas with intense cotton growing was detected suggesting selection due to either historical use of DDT, gene flow or cross-resistance. All An. gambiae s.s were molecular s-forms and only the west (leu-phe) kdr was detected. Complete susceptibility to the organophosphates and carbamates provides a possibility to switch to these alternative insecticide classes for IRS. The detected increases in the malaria prevalence in localities with high insecticide resistance levels indicate vector control failure. These findings point to the need for information on underlying biochemical and molecular resistance mechanisms to make possible the design of an effective resistance management strategy, and for the assessment of the impact of resistance on interventions.  The results indicate that the impact of malaria control can be optimally assessed by using a combination of epidemiological (routine surveillance and prevalence data) and entomological indicators, in the context of a malaria decision support system, to enhance policy formulation for objective implementation of malaria control interventions and rational use of available resources.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"A study of the electrical properties of polycrystalline based organic devices.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/6353/","Afzal, Sidra; Afzal, Sidra","June 2012","In this thesis, examination of polycrystalline organic based devices such as the Schottky diode and MOS capacitor is carried out. The data is interpreted in terms of a polycrystalline model based mainly on a conventional polysilicon model with slight modifications to fit the organic properties. A brief introduction to the existing charge transport models for organic materials is presented.  The most dominant being the variable range hopping model for disordered materials. The disorder analysis is appropriate in the grain boundaries of a polycrystalline material. The distribution of the traps of density of states (DOS) is commonly described by the Gaussian distribution and the associated exponential approximate at low energies. This is a valid assumption for organic semiconductors with low carrier mobility values [N. Sedghi et al., J. Non Crys. Solids 352, 1641, 2006].  Detailed investigation on the temperature effects of the polycrystalline Schottky diode leads to determination of important electrical parameters. Such studies are essential in understanding the conduction processes of the organic device, particularly in terms of trapping effects, which is essential in the development of device models for organic circuitry. Several parameters such as dopant (ND) and carrier concentrations (p), effective mobility (μeff), depletion width (Wdep), effective Debye length (LDe), Meyer Neldel energy (MNE) and the characteristic temperature of the carriers (T0) are extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of the diode. For a soluble derivative of pentacene, 6, 13-triisopropylsilyethynyl pentacene (TIPS) blended with Polytriarylamine (PTAA), the respective values extracted at room temperature are found to be approximately 1017 cm-3, 1.8x10-2 cm2V-1s-1, 185 nm, 11 nm, 31.5 meV and 780 K, respectively. As the temperature falls, the values of most parameters remain constant until a critical temperature. The activation energy also remains constant at approximately 0.3 eV for various applied voltages in saturation. Below this critical temperature, Wdep, LDe and T0 increase whilst μeff, ND/p and characteristic temperature of the states (TC) decrease. Similar analysis is carried out on doped layers of TIPS with a different insulating binder Poly-alpha methylstyrene (PAMS). The value of Wdep, LDe, T0, μeff, ND/p, MNE and TC obtained from such doped Schottky diode are approximately 100 nm, 5 nm, 1200 K, 1x10-2  cm2V-1s-1, 2x1017 cm-3, 35 meV and 400 K, respectively. The Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) analysis on polycrystalline Schottky diodes provides ND of approximately 7.6 x 1016 cm-3, 5.2 x 1014 cm-3 and 2.98 x 1014cm-3 at 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz respectively. These ND values are lower than those extracted from current-voltage characteristics and decrease with increasing frequency. This is thought to be due to the low mobility of holes, unable to respond to the signal at higher frequencies. The conduction in polycrystalline organic Schottky diode is proposed using a 2-dimensional (2D) model, which focuses on both the lateral and vertical conduction paths. The organic semiconductor layer is assumed to be relatively thin so that only a single layer of the grain exists between adjacent grain boundaries for the vertical conduction. A two dimensional situation is treated as two separate one dimensional problems that are positioned at right angles to each other. The grain and grain boundaries in the polycrystalline material are explained in terms of two boundary conditions. The variation of potential in grain boundary is the basis in defining the variation of potential in the grains. Conduction under forward bias in the grain and grain boundary is thus established assuming two distributions for the DOS, namely the Gaussian and Laplace. In comparison, Laplace DOS is believed to be a better representation of the distribution of states, where a large number of energy levels are being scanned with applied voltage. The ac properties of a polycrystalline based MOS capacitor are investigated. The frequency and temperature effects on the C-V characteristics of MOS capacitor based on another soluble derivative of pentacene, refered here as S1150, are studied. Equivalent circuits which include the effects of bulk and series resistance due to contact effects are analysed. The bulk resistance (Rb), bulk capacitance (Cb) and series resistance (RS) are found to be approximately 13 kΩ, 760 pF and less than 309 Ω respectively, for an organic film thickness (tOSC) of 27nm. For ND ≈ 3.6 x 1017cm-3 at 1 kHz, the hole mobility is found to be approximately 4.6x10-7cm2V-1s-1. As expected the mobility decreases with increase in frequency. Furthermore, the temperature study of inverse square space charge capacitance (1/CS2) against absolute temperature (T) provides an intercept close to T (~ 330K) instead of TC. A low intercept value indicates a decrease in disorder which suggests that the large grains may be dominating the capacitance.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Compressed sensing on terahertz imaging.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/8457/","Shen, H","June 2012","Most terahertz (THz) time-domain (pulsed) imaging experiments that have been performed by raster scanning the object relative to a focused THz beam require minutes or even hours to acquire a complete image. This slow image acquisition is a major limiting factor for real-time applications. Other systems using focal plane detector arrays can acquire images in real-time, but they are too expensive or are limited by low sensitivity in the THz range. More importantly, such systems cannot provide spectroscopic information of the sample.  To develop faster and more efficient THz time-domain (pulsed) imaging systems, this research used random projection approach to reconstruct THz images from the synthetic and real-world THz data based on the concept of compressed/compressive sensing/sampling (CS). Compared with conventional THz time-domain (pulsed) imaging, no raster scanning of the object is required. The simulation results demonstrated that CS has great potential for real-time THz imaging systems because its use can dramatically reduce the number of measurements in such systems.  We then implemented two different CS-THz systems based on the random projection method. One is a compressive THz time-domain (pulsed) spectroscopic imaging system using a set of independent optimized masks. A single-point THz detector, together with a set of 40 optimized two-dimensional binary masks, was used to measure the THz waveforms transmitted through a sample. THz time- and frequency-domain images of the sample comprising 20×20 pixels were subsequently reconstructed. This demonstrated that both the spatial distribution and the spectral characteristics of a sample can be obtained by this means. Compared with conventional THz time-domain (pulsed) imaging, ten times fewer THz spectra need to be taken.  In order to further speed up the image acquisition and reconstruction process, another hardware implementation - a single rotating mask (i.e., the spinning disk) with random binary patterns - was utilized to spatially modulate a collimated THz. After propagating through the sample, the THz beam was measured using a single detector, and a THz image was subsequently reconstructed using the CS approach. This demonstrated that a 32×32 pixel image could be obtained from 160 to 240 measurements. This spinning disk configuration allows the use of an electric motor to rotate the spinning disk, thus enabling the experiment to be performed automatically and continuously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental implementation of a spinning disk configuration for high speed compressive image acquisition.  A three-dimensional (3D) joint reconstruction approach was developed to reconstruct THz images from random/incomplete subsets of THz data. Such a random sampling method provides a fast THz imaging acquisition and also simplifies the current THz imaging hardware implementation. The core idea is extended in image inpainting to the case of 3D data. Our main objective is to exploit both spatial and spectral/temporal information for recovering the missing samples. It has been shown that this approach has superiority over the case where the spectral/temporal images are treated independently. We first proposed to learn a spatio-spectral/temporal dictionary from a subset of available training data. Using this dictionary, the THz images can then be jointly recovered from an incomplete set of observations. The simulation results using the measured THz image data confirm that this 3D joint reconstruction approach also provides a significant improvement over the existing THz imaging methods.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"S.Virchow infection and the immune responses produced in poultry.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/9133/","Salisbury, Anne","August 2012","Relatively little is known about Salmonella Virchow as a pathogen. Its prevalence varies from country to country, however it is constantly associated with invasive disease, particularly in children and the immuno-compromised. The main sources of S. Virchow are humans and poultry. The aims of this study were to determine the genetic relatedness of S. Virchow isolates from difference sources in England, to characterise its infection biology using in vitro and in vivo based models, to establish the immune response produced by poultry in response to infection with the serovar and to begin to determine the level of protection and cross-protection that could be achieved against the serovar and S. Typhimurium.   The genetic relatedness of the S. Virchow isolates was determined using molecular typing techniques including MLST and PFGE. The isolates were screened for the presence of 12 virulence genes that have been associated with adhesion, invasion and persistence. Human and avian cell lines and in vivo poultry infection experiments were used to characterise S. Virchow’s invasiveness, persistence and ability to elicit an immune response, compared to a well characterised S. Typhimurium isolate. Immune responses were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and ELISA, to establish aspects of the innate, cellular and humoral response, as well as cytokine and chemokine expression. An in vivo poultry infection experiment was performed to gain an indication of the level of protection and cross-protection offered by primary infection with S. Virchow against secondary infection. Bacteriology, ELISA and western blot methods were used analyse this.  Overall, S. Virchow appears to be a relatively clonal serovar, regardless of the source and the results indicate this is widespread and not solely in the UK. All of the isolates possessed the 12 virulence genes, which could contribute to its virulence in some hosts. S. Virchow was particularly persistent and inflammatory in the human Caco2 cells, which is consistent with the increased virulence previously reported in humans. The in vitro HD11 assay and the in vivo poultry infection experiments were consistent in showing S. Virchow colonises the chicken intestine to high levels, causes transient systemic infection and stimulates a moderate inflammatory response, very similar to S. Typhimurium infection. S. Virchow infection stimulated all aspects of the chicken immune system, characteristic of a broad-range serovar. Initial results from the in vivo protection experiment showed primary infection with S. Virchow does offer some protection against systemic invasion, although adequate protection against caecal colonisation was not found. However, 2 proteins were identified that strongly reacted and cross-reacted with sera from infected chickens, providing optimism that a vaccine to protect against S. Virchow colonisation could be developed with further research.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Does Fasciola hepatica infection increase the susceptibility of cattle to infection with other pathogens normally controlled by a Th1 or pro-inflammatory response?","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/9455/","Claridge, Jennifer","September 2012","Fasciola hepatica is a trematode parasite with wide geographical and host ranges, primarily affecting ruminants in the United Kingdom. Infection of host animals leads to significant economic losses in production, with reduced weight gains and milk quality and quantity. Clinical disease, known as fasciolosis, is expensive to treat and causes significant morbidity and mortality. More than three quarters of dairy herds surveyed in England and Wales have been exposed to this parasite, and the number of diagnoses of fasciolosis, made by the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency, has increased dramatically in the last fifteen years. Experimental studies have demonstrated failure to diagnose bovine tuberculosis (BTB) when co-infection with F. hepatica is present. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate a novel method for estimating the prevalence of BTB in England and Wales and show that, in light of the imperfect diagnostic test for BTB, the prevalence may be significantly higher than currently reported. In Chapter 3, a logistic regression model for the presence or absence of BTB on farms in England and Wales is designed, based upon those previously published. The addition of a variable to describe the burden of F. hepatica found in the locality of each farm significantly increases the predictive power of the model and may help to explain the under-diagnosis of BTB suggested in Chapter 2. A significant, negative association is demonstrated between F. hepatica exposure and the BTB status of the farm. The difference between the model predictions for BTB status made with F. hepatica exposure as tested and the predictions made assuming F. hepatica exposure is negative is then calculated to provide an estimate of the missing BTB diagnoses due to co-infection. We show this under-ascertainment to be over one third of cases. The significant, negative association between F. hepatica exposure and BTB diagnosis described at the herd level in Chapter 3, is then tested on an animal level. In Chapter 4, milk samples from individual animals testing negative and inconclusive, or negative and positive to the BTB test are assessed using the anti-F. hepatica antibody ELISA and an exposure value obtained. Significantly higher exposure to F. hepatica was not found in either pairing of BTB outcome-cattle and potential reasons for this are discussed. Chapter 5 investigates the association between F. hepatica exposure and other infectious diseases such as Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDv), Leptospira spp, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis, Johnes Disease and Neospora caninum. A random effects model is constructed using information collected about animal and farm parameters, to predict F. hepatica exposure. Vaccination against BVDv and Leptospira spp are shown to be significantly associated, the former being positively and the latter being negatively correlated. Johnes Disease prevalence is negatively associated with F. hepatica exposure and Salmonella Dublin prevalence is positively associated. Farm management and husbandry variables were also found to be significantly associated with F. hepatica exposure. In total, this thesis adds to the growing realisation that co-infection with this pathogen can have significant repercussions on the diagnostic ability of the BTB test and on the health and welfare of the national herd.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Generation of PKCbII transgenic mice for the study of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/15335/","Azar, AA; Marshall-Clarke, S; Vlatkovic, N; Slupsky, J","December 2013","The malignant cells of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) over-express PKCβII, a feature pathogenically important because the TCL1 mouse model of CLL fails to develop disease when PKCβ expression is disrupted. The purpose of this project was to generate transgenic mice in which PKCβII is over-expressed only in B cells. The central hypothesis of this thesis was that over-expression of PKCII in developing B cells will shift development to favour the generation of the B-1 and MZ B cell populations and eventually lead to the development of a CLL-like disease in the mouse. To construct the expression plasmid, an Eµ promoter was used to direct B cell-specific expression of PKCβII in transgenic mice (Eµ-PKCβII tg mice). PKCβII was tagged with haemagglutination antigen (HA) for identification in Western blots and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Also, mCherry was integrated within the expression plasmid construct in order to visualize transgenic B cells. Over-expressed PKCβII and mCherry fluorescence were detected when this plasmid was tested in A20 cells, a mouse B lymphoma cell line. The construct was then injected into pro-nuclei of fertilized ova isolated from pregnant mice. The injected ova were then transferred to recipient mice to generate potential founder mice. Sequential crossings of transgenic litters born from a single founder mouse led to the generation of homozygous Eµ-PKCβII tg mice. In the spleen of Eµ-PKCβII tg mice, the expression of the transgenic PKCIIHA was detected and quantification of PKCβII, using Western blotting, showed that PKCβII was over-expressed in Eµ-PKCβII tg mice compared with wild type mice. However, the mCherry could not be detected; this might be due to the fact that expression of the secondary gene(in this case mCherry) was not always efficient because of variable transcription from the IRES sequence. IHC analysis of the spleen of Eµ-PKCβII tg mice confirmed the expression of PKCIIHA in B cell-rich tissues where the staining for either HA or for PKCII showed the high expression of these proteins in the white pulp of the spleen specifically to the follicular region. There was no notable development of disease, CLL-like or otherwise in aged Eµ-PKCβII tg mice, but Flow cytometry analysis pointed out that the over-expression of PKCII resulted in a reduction in the proportion of follicular B cells and an increase in the proportion of MZ B cells in the spleen, and in B-1 cells in peritoneum and periphery of Eµ-PKCβII tg mice. This expansion of MZ B cells in the spleen was confirmed by H&E stains showing an enlarged marginal zone within the structure of the spleen, and IgM stains showed that this expanded MZ consists mainly of IgM+ cells. Thus, the generation of a mouse that over-expresses PKCII specifically within the B cell compartment led to an expansion in the populations of IgM+ B cells (MZ and B-1 B cells) and a reduction of follicular (mature) B cells. This mouse may be useful for the study of human CLL because of the potential to accelerate disease progression, and would therefore serve as a useful model for drug testing.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Novel amphiphilic branched copolymer nanoparticles as candidates for drug delivery.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/16215/","Slater, Rebecca","August 2013","The methanolic atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) of 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) to controllably form the hydrophobic polymer p(HPMA) using a one-pot methodology at ambient temperature has been demonstrated, where polymerisations were shown to reach >99 % conversion.  By simple variation of initiator:monomer feed ratio, polymers of varying chain length were synthesised. Using identical polymerisation conditions, addition of a small amount of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) divinyl brancher resulted in the generation of high molecular weight branched copolymers without any modification of reaction kinetics. This approach was extended to include the first synthesis of linear and branched amphiphilic A-B block copolymers using polyethylene oxide (PEG) macroinitiators without loss of the ATRP controlled polymerisation. A series of systematically varying copolymers, containing variation in PEG length and/or variation in p(HPMA) primary chain length, have been synthesised to allow direct comparison of the impact of architectural variation on polymer properties.   Nanopreciptation approaches were investigated for the linear and branched copolymers and extremely stable hydrophobic nanoparticles were produced using copolymers with branched architecture. Moreover, it has been shown that nanoparticle z-average diameter can be controlled using extremely facile methods.  The loading capacity of amphiphilic branched A-B block copolymer nanoparticles with various guest-molecules has been systematically investigated.  The world leading HIV/AIDS antiretroviral drug Lopinavir (LPV) was used in a preliminary loading screen and shown to produce candidate LPV/drug nanocarrier options for future studies and optimisation.","AI","University of Liverpool"

This article addresses this gap and makes methodological and substantive contributions.  This is the first study of luxury wines from Chile.  It examines, among other factors, the contribution of foreign influence to opportunity recognition and exploitation, and the determinants of the speed at which national companies start playing roles initially played by foreigners.  Results from several research methods (X2 tests, binary probit, ordered probit, censored and truncated regressions) are compared.  Not all the results are robust.  Significant roles are confirmed for foreign influence, the long-term presence of a senior expert winemaker and, (‘perversely’), successful participation in international competitions, but not for other, often mentioned factors.  Other conclusions refer to the gradual decline of the foreign role, winemaker migration between employers, and unusual pricing strategies.  Results from any individual research method should be checked against other methods and periods, including non-econometric methods.  We study luxury wine (US 50 dollars plus per bottle) from Chile, but the findings are relevant to other wine regions.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Nitric oxide availability is increased in contracting skeletal muscle from aged mice, but does not differentially decrease muscle superoxide.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2005242/","Pearson, T; McArdle, A; Jackson, MJ","January 2015","Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species have been implicated in the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that occurs during aging. Nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide are generated by skeletal muscle and where these are generated in proximity their chemical reaction to form peroxynitrite can compete with the superoxide dismutation to hydrogen peroxide. Changes in NO availability may therefore theoretically modify superoxide and peroxynitrite activities in tissues, but published data are contradictory regarding aging effects on muscle NO availability. We hypothesised that an age-related increase in NO generation might increase peroxynitrite generation in muscles from old mice, leading to an increased nitration of muscle proteins and decreased superoxide availability. This was examined using fluorescent probes and an isolated fiber preparation to examine NO content and superoxide in the cytosol and mitochondria of muscle fibers from adult and old mice both at rest and following contractile activity. We also examined the 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and peroxiredoxin 5 (Prx5) content of muscles from mice as markers of peroxynitrite activity. Data indicate that a substantial age-related increase in NO levels occurred in muscle fibers during contractile activity and this was associated with an increase in muscle eNOS. Muscle proteins from old mice also showed an increased 3-NT content. Inhibition of NOS indicated that NO decreased superoxide bioavailability in muscle mitochondria, although this effect was not age related. Thus increased NO in muscles of old mice was associated with an increased 3-NT content that may potentially contribute to age-related degenerative changes in skeletal muscle.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Some of these proteins have been shown to manipulate or subvert cellular processes during infection, but functional roles of a majority of them remain unknown. Lpg0393 is a newly identified Legionella effector classified as a hypothetical protein. Through X-ray crystallographic analysis, we show that Lpg0393 contains a Vps9-like domain, which is structurally most similar to the catalytic core of human Rabex-5 that activates the endosomal Rab proteins Rab5, Rab21 and Rab22. Consistently, Lpg0393 exhibited a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor activity toward the endosomal Rabs. This work identifies the first example of a bacterial guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that is active towards the Rab5 sub-cluster members, implying that the activation of these Rab proteins might be advantageous for the intracellular survival of Legionella.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"The effectiveness of emergency obstetric care training in Kenya.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2008539/","Ameh, Charles","November 2014","Background and introduction Maternal deaths are highest in low resource countries, skilled attendance at birth (SBA) and the availability of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) are key strategies to improve maternal health and achieve the millennium development goal number 5. In-service emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) training has been used for many years to improve the quality of skilled attendance at birth and availability of EmOC, however few packages have been properly described and evaluated. There is no published comprehensive evaluation of EmONC in-service training packages in low resourced countries. An evaluation of the effectiveness of an EmONC training intervention in 10 comprehensive EmOC Kenya hospitals was carried out from 2010-2011.  Methods A systematic review was performed based on grading of recommendations assessments development and evaluation (GRADE) guidelines to identify the various EmONC training packages in low and middle income countries, identify literature on the effectiveness of these packages or effectiveness of various components of EmONC training globally.  The components of the intervention were training in EmONC, provision of EmOC equipment and supportive supervision. The objective of the intervention was to improve the recognition and treatment of emergency obstetric and newborn complications at all study sites by trained maternity care providers (MCP). A before/after study design and an adapted four level Kirkpatrick framework (level 1: reaction to training, level 2: learning, level 3: behaviour/practice, level 4: EmOC availability, health outcomes and ‘up-skilling’) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the training package. Mixed research methods (quantitative and qualitative approaches) were used to collect data 3 months before the intervention and at 3 monthly intervals after up to 12 months after the intervention. Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS version 20 and qualitative data was analysed using Nvivo 9. Descriptive statistics and analysis using t-tests were performed for quantitative data (significance in mean difference at 95% confidence) while framework analysis was used for qualitative data.  Results 20 EmONC in-service training programmes implemented in low and middle-income countries were identified. The content of 85% (17) of the programmes identified included EmOC signal functions and 7 programmes were 7 days or more in duration. 50% (10) of the EmONC training packages identified had training reports of which only two studies were evaluated at Kirkpatrick level 3 (behaviour) and there was no evaluation at level 4 (health outcomes) identified. Over 70% of all identified maternity care providers from all 10 hospitals were trained. 83% (328) of the 400 health care workers trained were midwives, 6% (26) were medical doctors, 2% (8) were clinical officers and 3% (11) were obstetricians. At 12 months post training the proportion of MCP trained in each hospital was at least 83% except for Nakuru PGH (23%) and Mbagathi GH (50%). Kirkpatrick level 1: About 95% (380) participants responded to level 1 assessment questionnaire. Trainees reacted positively to all lectures (n=11, mean score was 9.38/100, SD: 0.12) and breakout sessions (n=25, mean score was 9.33/10, SD: 0.14).

"Long-term carbon storage in a semi-natural British woodland.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2013048/","Hale, Karen","January 2015","Atmospheric levels of CO2 are currently 395 ppm (dry air mole fraction measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii), their highest concentration in 420,000 years. Forests play a major role in the global carbon (C) cycle by taking up inorganic C as CO2 through photosynthesis, converting it to organic compounds (biomass), and either storing it in living and dead organic matter (above and below ground: including trees, dead wood, litter, and soil) or returning it to the atmosphere by respiration, decay or fire. Globally, forests cover around 4.1 billion ha of the Earth’s surface and are estimated to contain up to 80% of all aboveground C and around 40% of all belowground (soils, litter, roots) terrestrial C. Forest C stocks have been reported to be increasing over the past 50 years in Europe and over the past 17 years in the United States. However, national forest inventories used to provide these data are often biased towards managed plantations, thereby leaving a knowledge gap regarding the dynamics of unmanaged, semi-natural forests. There are significant uncertainties about changes in C flux through time and the relative contributions of drivers such as land use, climate and atmospheric CO2. Decomposition of tree root C represents a potentially large C flux and contribution to the soil C sink when the input of dead and decaying root tissue, and root exudates, are greater than the output from respiration of roots, their symbionts, and the soil decomposer organisms. Therefore, quantifying decomposition rates and identifying primary controls of root decomposition are important for evaluating ecosystem function and possible responses to environmental change. This thesis explores long-term C dynamics in Lady Park Wood (LPW), an ancient semi-natural woodland situated in the counties of Monmouthshire and Gloucestershire, UK. We calculated changing tree biomass C stocks in LPW from 1945 to 2010. Separate estimates of tree biomass C, soil C and dead wood C were obtained to verify how C is apportioned among these types of forests. We used the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to explore the likely contributions of temperature, CO2 and management to forest C stocks in this region during the last 65 years.

"Using technology for student feedback: Lecturer perspectives.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2014121/","Arnold, Lydia Jane","October 2014","The purpose of this research is to investigate lecturers’ experiences of choosing and using technology for feedback in the context of UK higher education. The study takes a critical realist perspective and utilises a narrative interview methodology. Analysis is undertaken using two complementary approaches. First a connecting strategy explores the themes within each participant’s account, and then a categorising strategy looks at similarities and differences between cases. As a product of the analysis, portraits are created to encapsulate each individual lecturer’s experience. The findings provide a thick description of the deliberations undertaken by lecturers in the formation of feedback practice and in the associated technology selection. Participants come from a range of discipline areas and from five different institutions. They use technologies that incorporate text, audio and audio-visual media. The findings demonstrate that practice is shaped by underlying beliefs about how students use feedback, differing conceptions of academic identity, perspectives of students’ technology expectations, the search for efficiencies, changes in the types of teaching undertaken, professional history, and technological confidence. Individual lecturers are shown to exercise different reflective modes and they mediate the influences on practice in the context of personal priorities. Social networks are shown to be very important in framing feedback and technology related concerns. The practice landscape is shown to be contentious as lecturers hold views about each other’s feedback diligence and technology use. Engagement with technology impacted on lecturers’ perceptions of the quality of feedback being produced. It also triggered some lecturers to reflect on feedback through a different lens and to begin to challenge some of their established practices. The study concludes with recommendations to educational developers and to higher education institutions. More research into the relationship that lecturers have with feedback and technology is recommended.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Diagnostic aids might help detection and improve early diagnosis, but there remains little robust evidence supporting the use of any particular diagnostic technology at the moment. The aim of the present feasibility first-in-human study was to evaluate the preliminary diagnostic validity of a novel technology platform based on dielectrophoresis (DEP). DEP does not require labeling with antibodies or stains and it is an ideal tool for rapid analysis of cell properties. Cells from OOPC/dysplasia tissue and healthy oral mucosa were collected from 57 study participants via minimally-invasive brush biopsies and tested with a prototype DEP platform using median membrane midpoint frequency as main analysis parameter. Results indicate that the current DEP platform can discriminate between brush biopsy samples from cancerous and healthy oral tissue with a diagnostic sensitivity of 81.6% and a specificity of 81.0%. The present ex vivo results support the potential application of DEP testing for identification of OOPC. This result indicates that DEP has the potential to be developed into a low-cost, rapid platform as an assistive tool for the early identification of oral cancer in primary care; given the rapid, minimally-invasive and non-expensive nature of the test, dielectric characterization represents a promising platform for cost-effective early cancer detection.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Can clinical signs, clinicopathological findings and abdominal ultrasonography predict the site of histopathological abnormalities of the alimentary tract in cats?","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2029862/","Freiche, V; Faucher, MR; German, Alex","October 2015","Objectives Many cats with gastrointestinal signs have coexisting abnormalities in the intestine, liver and pancreas. Investigations typically involve clinicopathological tests, diagnostic imaging and biopsy, either at coeliotomy or by non-invasive means. While exploratory coeliotomy enables all organs to be sampled simultaneously, it is invasive and might not be necessary. The aim of the current study was to assess the performance of preliminary clinical information in predicting the histopathological presence of abnormalities in alimentary tract organs in cats. Methods The records of 38 cats with alimentary tract signs, which had ultimately undergone exploratory coeliotomy and surgical biopsy, were reviewed. The clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging findings and histopathology results were reviewed. Results On histopathological analysis, lesions were detected in 29/37 (78%) liver biopsies, in 29/35 (83%) gastrointestinal biopsies and in 17/37 (46%) pancreatic samples, the majority of which were inflammatory in nature. Clinical signs were generally poor markers of the presence of lesions in the alimentary tract. Further, while liver enzyme activity was relatively specific (88–100%) for detecting histopathological abnormalities in the liver, sensitivity was poor (11–50%). Pancreatic histopathological abnormalities were present in 1/3 of the cats with a positive pancreas-specific lipase result, and in 6/8 cats with a negative result. While relatively specific (57–100%) for both intestinal (57–100%) and hepatic (71–80%) histopathological abnormalities, abdominal ultrasonography lacked sensitivity for both organs (intestine 50–80%; liver 20–25%). In contrast, ultrasonography was relatively sensitive (50–80%), but not specific (17–22%) for detecting pancreatic lesions. Conclusions and relevance Clinical signs, and clinicopathological and ultrasonographic abnormalities lack precision for hepatic and pancreatic histopathological lesions in cats with alimentary tract signs, and cannot reliably predict from which organs biopsies should be collected. Arguably, therefore, exploratory coeliotomy is necessary to determine the site of histopathological abnormalities in feline alimentary tract disorders.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Selling the Object of Strategy: How Frontline Workers Realize Strategy through their Daily Work.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2036639/","Balogun, Julia; Best, Katie; Lê, Jane","November 2015","This paper explores how frontline workers contribute to an organization’s realized strategy. Using a workplace studies approach, we analyse the work of museum tour guides as a salient example of workers engaged in frontline work. Our findings demonstrate the subtle and intricate nature of the embodied work of frontline workers as they ‘bring into being’ the strategic aims of an organization. We identified five elements as central to this process: (1) the situated physical context; (2) audience composition; (3) the moral order; (4) the talk, actions and gestures of the guide; and (5) the corresponding talk, actions and gestures of the audience. Drawing on these categories, we find frontline workers to demonstrate ‘interactional competence’: assessing and making use of the physical, spatial and material specifics of the context and those they are interacting with, and enlisting interactional resources to uphold a moral order that brings these others in as a working audience, encouraging them to respond in particular ways. Frontline workers thus skilfully combine language, material and bodily expressions in the flow of their work. Demonstrating these dynamics gives a more central role to material in the realization of strategy than previously recognized; demonstrates that ‘outsiders’ have an important part to play in realizing strategy; and highlights the importance of frontline workers and their skilled work in bringing strategy into being.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The importance of refurbishing the existing UK housing to help the government achieve its climate change targets has been more widely recognised in recent years, and major programmes of residential retrofit have been instigated. Building Information Modelling (BIM) offers, potentially, a comprehensive and integrated platform for these retrofit programmes. However, BIM has traditionally been applied in medium to large-scale projects. There is only limited research that has investigated the use of BIM’s potentials in small scale and residential refurbishment projects. The ongoing research discussed in this paper aims to investigate the usability of BIM procedures in the retrofit of existing housing through energy performance modelling. The outcomes from this research can be used to develop a framework which utilises BIM to support efficient and effective design and construction processes and informs decision making at all stages of retrofitting projects, thereby improving not just the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock but also the effectiveness of the processes that deliver that efficiency.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The purpose of this paper is to review and classify entrepreneurial social capital studies according to the following approaches – objectivist (positivistrealist, structuralist) and subjectivist (social constructionist). There is a neglect of structure and agency, and the authors encourage a critical realist approach that permits an understanding of observable network structure, constraint-order and human agency as a dynamic system. Design/methodology/approach – The ontological and epistemological assumptions, and associated strengths and weaknesses of objectivist (positivist-realist, structuralist) and subjectivist (social constructionist) entrepreneurial social capital studies are discussed. The case for a more progressive critical realist approach is developed. Findings – The authors demonstrate that objectivist (positivist-realist, structuralist) research with findings bereft of situated meaning and agency dominates. The emergence of subjectivist research – narratively examining different network situations from the perspective of those embedded in networks – is an emerging and competing approach. This dualism is unlikely to comprehensively understand the complex system-level properties of social capital. Future research should adopt critical realism and fuse: objective data to demonstrate the material aspects of network structures and what structural social capital exists in particular settings; and subjective data that enhances an understanding of situated meaning, agency and intention in a network. Originality/value – This paper contributes a review of entrepreneurial social capital research and philosophical foundations.

"Integrating Perspectives on Rodent Sperm Competition.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2050879/","Ramm, SA; Stockley, P","February 2016","Rodents have long been recognised as an ideal model group for studying vertebrate sperm competition, since they exhibit very wide diversity in mating systems and are amenable to both experimental and comparative research approaches. From a strong initial focus on copulatory behaviour and patterns of paternity, a new generation of studies is now revealing adaptive variation in diverse male reproductive traits, aided by methodological advances that most recently include post-genomic approaches. Here we aim to assess the current state of knowledge about rodent sperm competition, and demonstrate how recent progress is building a more integrated view of the evolution of male reproductive phenotypes. Surveying research across six key male reproductive traits – copulatory behaviour, sperm production, sperm allocation, sperm quality, seminal fluid and genitalia – our review reveals a rich catalogue of male adaptations to sperm competition in rodents. Recent molecular and genome-based approaches are already transforming our understanding of these traits, closing the gap between genotypic and phenotypic perspectives on their adaptive evolution. Significant future challenges lie in integrating female roles in post-copulatory sexual selection, and in judging the relative importance of the myriad male adaptations to sperm competition, both in relation to one another in determining competitive fertilization ability, and compared to other sexually selected traits in explaining differential reproductive success.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Enterprise, small business development and the North West Region.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3000241/","Heywood, DC; Southern, A","April 2016","Purpose: The paper explores views from the private sector on the environment for enterprise in the North West region.  Perspectives on start-up strategy and on business development more generally including small business growth, human capital and the role of the North West Development Agency, are critically examined by the authors.  It is essential to comprehend the meaning that lies behind the views of private business to help assess the relative naivety – or not as the case may be – of government policy. Design/Methodology/Approach: The approach to the work has been exploratory and qualitative in nature.  The study is based on 19 semi structured face-to-face interviews, 3 telephone interviews and 5 focus groups conducted over a two month period involving small business owners and members of a nationally recognised professional advisory organisation. Findings: The interviews demonstrate a juxtaposition of regional parallels poised neatly against an untidy mix of views on business strategy for the region.  The rich tapestry of perspectives highlight significant similarity in the interests of businesses in the region but also demonstrate differences in the perspectives of business owners and the advisors who aim to support business owners ‘best interests’.  It amplifies individuals’ perspectives according to their firm size, age, sector and location. Implications: Implications are paradoxical.  Researchers, policy makers and professional advisors in the private and public sector attempt to ascertain the macro implications of focused policy in respect of their own perspectives.  This is possibly distorted when it runs against those of the business owners themselves. The provision of business support is a contentious area of discussion and this paper highlights the heterogeneity of businesses and why one size policy support rarely fits all, if ever. Originality/Value: The promotion of business in the North West is far from unique and is currently in the hands of the public sector through agencies such as Business Link, Enterprise Agencies and in some extreme cases, Local Strategic Partnerships. With productivity improvements and innovation being top of the nationwide agenda this paper examines how aware small business owners are of opportunities to meet this objective. At the same time it exposes the ‘pick-n-mix’ advisory provision that is currently available as inefficient and counter productive. Ideas about private sector advisory agents becoming support brokers are questioned and are argued to be premature, while the interpretation of productivity improvements, innovation and training as costs show tangible limitations to the development of enterprise in the region.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Our study thus contrasts with much of the literature on Northern Ireland, which is concerned with the impact of Protestant/Catholic or Unionist/Nationalist identities on such reconciliation processes in the workplace and more widely. This approach enables us to develop insights about implementation of such agendas, specifically concerning Northern Ireland and other deeply divided societies.

The solvents ability to form and remove [Na+‐O2−]ads based on Gutmann donor number influences the final discharge product and mechanism of the cell. Utilizing surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques, we demonstrate an analysis of the response of Na‐O2 cell chemistry with sulfoxide, amide, ether, and nitrile electrolyte solvents.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Enterprise in deprived areas - what is the relationship?","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3000884/","Heywood, D; Southern, A","April 2016","Objectives: This paper examines enterprise and its propensity to reduce the impact of area deprivation. The paper asks how the former can cure the latter and questions why enterprise and entrepreneurship policies are targeted at communities in areas of multiple deprivation.  Prior Work: There exists a vast index of literature on the success factors required for entrepreneurship to bring for instance, an increase in innovation, employment, productivity and economic growth. In spite of this accepted knowledge there has developed an increasing belief that deprived areas can be turned around with more start-ups and entrepreneurial activity. It has also been argued that start-up rates in deprived areas are exceptionally low and in some way this concurs with the volume of studies highlighting the plight of residents of multiple deprivation areas. Enterprise policies aimed at deprived areas therefore appear to be a stimulant to try to alleviate the economic and social burden in these communities.  Approach: A qualitative approach is adopted, focused on Merseyside – a designated Objective I sub-region – and a series of semi-structured recorded interviews with a wide range of policy makers and practitioners and other interest groups undertaken.  Results: The paper presents contrasting discourses on why and how enterprise, entrepreneurship and deprivation become associated.  Initial interpretation would suggest that those involved in supporting enterprise in deprived areas believe they are making entrepreneurship an option for significantly more individuals, although tend to display uncertainty when enterprise is presented as a means of reducing social exclusion.  Implications: For enterprise policies to be effective and efficiently implemented there needs to be a clarification of objectives. Without continuous critical reflection enterprise promotion will continue to be used to excuse failings currently outside the control of most deprived communities. The vagueness of whether enterprise support is warranted to help achieve social and economic inclusion may well be contradictory to the pursuit of economic growth and innovation.  Value: The originality of this paper lies in the proposition of simple questions concerning why ‘push’ enterprise policy onto certain selected communities and how we know this is beneficial.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"High temperature and wavelength dependence of avalanche gain of AlAsSb avalanche photodiodes.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3000896/","Sandall, Ian C; Xie, Shiyu; Xie, JingJing; Tan, Chee Hing","April 2016","The evolution of the dark currents and breakdown at elevated temperatures of up to 450  K are studied using thin AlAsSb avalanche regions. While the dark currents increase rapidly as the temperature is increased, the avalanche gain is shown to only have a weak temperature dependence. Temperature coefficients of breakdown voltage of 0.93 and 1.93  mV/K were obtained from the diodes of 80 and 230  nm avalanche regions (i-regions), respectively. These values are significantly lower than for other available avalanche materials at these temperatures. The wavelength dependence of multiplication characteristics of AlAsSb p-i-n diodes has also been investigated, and it was found that the ionization coefficients for electrons and holes are comparable within the electric field and wavelength ranges measured.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Unique microbial-derived volatile organic compounds in portal venous circulation in murine non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3001580/","Reid, DT; McDonald, B; Khalid, T; Vo, T; Schenck, LP; Surette, MG; Beck, PL; Reimer, RA; Probert, CS; Rioux, KP; Eksteen, B","November 2016","<h4>Background and aims</h4>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is now the leading liver disease in North America. The progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to the inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is complex and currently not well understood. Intestinal microbial dysbiosis has been implicated in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Volatile organic compounds are byproducts of microbial metabolism in the gut that may enter portal circulation and have hepatotoxic effects contributing to the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. To test this hypothesis, we measured volatile organic compounds in cecal luminal contents and portal venous blood in a mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on cecal content and portal vein blood for volatile organic compound detection from mice fed a methionine and choline deficient diet, which induces non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The colonic microbiome was studied by 16S rRNA gene amplification using the Illumina MiSeq platform.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-eight volatile organic compounds were detected in cecal luminal content, a subset of which was also present in portal venous blood. Importantly, differences in portal venous volatile organic compounds were associated with diet-induced steatohepatitis establishing a biochemical link between gut microbiota-derived volatile organic compounds and increased susceptibility to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our model creates a novel tool to further study the role of gut-derived volatile organic compounds in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Recent evidence suggests an important role of gut microbial dysbiosis in IBD, and this may be associated with changes in faecal volatile organic metabolites (VOMs).  Aim To describe the changes in the faecal VOMs of patients with IBD and establish their diagnostic potential as non‐invasive biomarkers.  Methods Faecal samples were obtained from 117 people with Crohn's disease (CD), 100 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 109 healthy controls. Faecal VOMs were extracted using solid‐phase micro‐extraction and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Data analysis was carried out using partial least squares‐discriminate analysis (PLS‐DA) to determine class membership based on distinct metabolomic profiles.  Results The PLS‐DA model showed clear separation of active CD from inactive disease and healthy controls (P < 0.001). Heptanal, 1‐octen‐3‐ol, 2‐piperidinone and 6‐methyl‐2‐heptanone were up‐regulated in the active CD group [variable important in projection (VIP) score 2.8, 2.7, 2.6 and 2.4, respectively], while methanethiol, 3‐methyl‐phenol, short‐chain fatty acids and ester derivatives were found to be less abundant (VIP score of 3.5, 2.6, 1.5 and 1.2, respectively). The PLS‐DA model also separated patients with small bowel CD from healthy controls and those with colonic CD from UC (P < 0.001). In contrast, less distinct separation was observed between active UC, inactive UC and healthy controls.  Conclusions Analysis of faecal volatile organic metabolites can provide an understanding of gut metabolomic changes in IBD. It has the potential to provide a non‐invasive means of diagnosing IBD, and can differentiate between UC and CD.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Evaluating the adaptive reuse potential of buildings in conservation areas: the Grand Canal area in Hangzhou, China.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3001859/","Hong, Y; Chen, F","June 2016","Purpose Adaptive reuse of building assets is an important approach to sustainability. Adapting a building for new uses often involves complex factors in the decision-making process, particularly in conservation areas. The paper aims to show an evaluation process of the adaptive reuse potential of historic buildings that are subject to change in the Grand Canal area, a world heritage site in Hangzhou, China.  Design/methodology/approach For this purpose, a model has been established with aggregated views of professionals on the degree to which a variety of factors affect the buildings’ potential for adaptive reuse. The model intends to help prioritise some of the buildings in the area for adaptive reuse, which is important for effective allocation of public resources. Interviews with professionals, analytic hierarchy process and the Delphi method have been used to establish the evaluation model. It is then applied to the Grand Canal area to generate indices for buildings’ adaptive reuse potential and the ranking of priority. The indices are generated through public scoring of historic buildings against the variables and calculated through the model.  Findings The paper concludes that the evaluation process is an effective way to engage the public in the decision-making process and to balance conflict interests of various stakeholders in the management of historic building assets in conservation areas.  Originality/value The research has proposed an evaluation model to help set priority of buildings subject to adaptive reuse and to help distribute public fund effectively. It facilitates wide public engagement in the decision-making progress of adaptive reuse of historic buildings.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Induction of IL-8(CXCL8) and MCP-1(CCL2) with oxidative stress and its inhibition with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in cell culture model using HK-2 cell.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3002135/","Kumar, Avneesh; Shalmanova, Liliana; Hammad, Abdul; Christmas, Stephen E","July 2016","Renal transplantation can often be complicated due to delayed graft function, which is a direct sequel of ischaemia reperfusion injury. The adverse outcome of delayed graft function is not only short term but the long-term function of the graft is also affected. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of ischaemia reperfusion injury. Reactive oxygen species are the key mediators in ischaemia reperfusion injury causing direct cell damage which also initiate inflammation by inducing chemokines. The presence of inflammation is a marker of severe delayed graft function. However, the effect of oxidative stress on the expression of key chemokines has not been fully established yet.  Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the oxidative stress response and the secretion of chemokines in a cell culture model that mimics the effects of ischaemia reperfusion injury in immortalised human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2.  Cells were treated with varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and markers of oxidative stress response and chemokine release were measured. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide induced a significant increase in the activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase and the levels of the chemokines Interleukin-8 (IL-8; CXCL8) and MCP-1 (CCL2). A dose related increase of chemokine secretion was also observed. The cytokine Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) at 1 ng/ml significantly potentiated the expression of both IL-8 (CXCL8) and MCP-1 (CCL2) which showed synergistic response in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Pre-incubation of the cells with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) strongly suppressed the induction of both IL-8 and MCP-1 when stimulated with hydrogen peroxide and IL-1β.  This study demonstrates the potential of anti-oxidants like N-acetyl cysteine in ameliorating the effects of ischaemia reperfusion injury thus suggesting a new therapeutic approach in renal transplantation. These findings can have potential implications for clinical use to prevent ischaemia reperfusion injury in renal transplantation.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Several friction material specimens having various orientation degrees of grooves cut on their surfaces are tested. Numerical studies using the methods of complex eigenvalue analysis and dynamic transient analysis are conducted to simulate the experimental process with the finite element (FE) software abaqus. Both experimental and numerical results show that surface modifications of friction material specimens have a significant influence on the squeal instability: cutting a 45 deg or 90 deg groove on the material surface can significantly reduce squeal noise, cutting a 135 deg groove just reduces squeal noise moderately and cutting a 0 deg groove cannot reduce squeal noise. Moreover, the contact pressure distributions for the original surface and modified surfaces are studied to provide a physical explanation of the noise phenomenon. The major finding that friction-induced noise can be reduced by means of suitable structural modifications of the contact interface is expected to have important and much wider applications.</jats:p>","AI","University of Liverpool"

Vibration signals of rolling bearings are widely used for bearing fault diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method that combines Blind Source Separation (BSS) and Spectral Kurtosis (SK) to separate independent noise sources. Normal, and incipient fault signals from vibration tests of rolling bearings are processed. We studied 16 groups of vibration signals (which all display an increase in kurtosis) of incipient degradation after they are processed by a BSS filter. Compared with conventional kurtosis, theoretical studies of SK trends show that the SK levels vary with frequencies and some experimental studies show that SK trends of measured vibration signals of bearings vary with the amount and level of impulses in both vibration and noise signals due to bearing faults. It is found that the peak values of SK increase when vibration signals of incipient faults are processed by a BSS filter. This pre-processing by a BSS filter makes SK more sensitive to impulses caused by performance degradation of bearings.</jats:p>","AI","University of Liverpool"

Excess alcohol use, smoking and higher body mass index are all associated with psoriasis and may contribute to its onset and/or exacerbation. Lifestyle behaviour change (LBC) can be beneficial in the prevention of psoriasis and/or reduction of its severity. LBC techniques are effective when used properly by healthcare professionals.<h4>Objectives</h4>It is unknown whether clinicians managing patients with psoriasis are familiar with LBC techniques or are confident to deliver LBC support in routine consultations. This study aimed to elicit the views and attitudes of healthcare professionals in primary and secondary care about addressing LBC for patients with psoriasis.<h4>Methods</h4>We carried out in-depth semistructured interviews with 23 dermatology specialist and general practitioners in English primary and secondary care settings stratified by discipline. Data were analysed using constant comparison and principles of Framework Analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Clinicians recognized that lifestyle behaviours were important in psoriasis management, but believed it was not their role to facilitate LBC.

The underlying data sets covered the time period 1993-2008. We used Monte Carlo simulation and a Bayesian approach, using a systematic review to generate Bayesian priors. We calculated point estimates with 95% credible intervals (CrI).<h4>Setting</h4>UK, 2009.<h4>Outcome measures</h4>Pathogen-specific estimates of the number of cases, general practice (GP) consultations and hospitalisations for foodborne disease in the UK in 2009.<h4>Results</h4>Bayesian approaches gave slightly more conservative estimates of overall health burden (∼511 000 cases vs 566 000 cases). Campylobacter is the most common foodborne pathogen, causing 280 400 (95% CrI 182 503-435 693) food-related cases and 38 860 (95% CrI 27 160-55 610) GP consultations annually. Despite this, there are only around 562 (95% CrI 189-1330) food-related hospital admissions due to Campylobacter, reflecting relatively low disease severity. Salmonella causes the largest number of hospitalisations, an estimated 2490 admissions (95% CrI 607-9631), closely followed by Escherichia coli O157 with 2233 admissions (95% CrI 170-32 159). Other common causes of foodborne disease include Clostridium perfringens, with an estimated 79 570 cases annually (95% CrI 30 700-211 298) and norovirus with 74 100 cases (95% CrI 61 150-89 660). Other viruses and protozoa ranked much lower as causes of foodborne disease.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The 3 models yielded similar estimates of the burden of foodborne illness in the UK and show that continued reductions in Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli O157, C. perfringens and norovirus are needed to mitigate the impact of foodborne disease.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Initially, diagnosis and staging are undertaken using contrastenhanced multidetector computerized tomography (CE-MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), supplemented with endoscopic ultrasound in selected cases. Staging laparoscopy (SL) with or without laparoscopic ultrasound (L-LUS) has been found to detect occult disease in 13-28% of patients with pancreatic cancer who are considered potentially resectable on imaging; however, between 1% and 30% of patients thought to be resectable on SL/L-LUS have subsequently been found to have unresectable disease. The clinical utility of SL/L-LUS can be enhanced by adopting a selective approach, only undertaking SL/L-LUS when one or more criteria are present, including (1) presumed pancreatic primary >3 cm diameter, (2) lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas, (3)CA19-9>150 kU/L (>300when total bilirubin >35 micromol/L), and (4) platelet/lymphocyte ratio >150. The judicious use of SL/L-LUS and cross-sectional imaging are complementary; however, the advent of PETCT may lead to improvements in the detection of small previously radiologically occult metastases and may reduce the future role of SL/L-LUS.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Most important of all, the newly proposed memristive circuit has a line equilibrium and its stability closely relies on memristor initial condition, which results in the emergence of extreme multistability. Stability distribution related to memristor initial condition is numerically estimated and the coexistence of infinitely many attractors is intuitively captured by numerical simulations and PSIM circuit simulations.","AI","University of Liverpool"

It was found that the grain size increased at 350 °C and decreased between 350 and 850 °C, while creeping up again at 850 °C. UV-vis characterization shows that the optical band gap shifts towards larger wavelengths. The Hall measurement shows that the resistivity almost keeps constant at low annealing temperatures, and increases rapidly after treatment at 750 °C due to the effect of both the carrier concentration and the Hall mobility. The best annealing temperature is found in the range of 350-550 °C. The ZnO:Zr film-coated glass substrates show good optical and electrical performance up to 550 °C during superstrate thin film solar cell deposition.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Inadequately treated wastes from humans and livestock dosed with antimicrobial drugs are often assumed to be the main sources of AMR to wildlife. While wildlife populations closely associated with human populations are more likely to harbour clinically important AMR related to that found in local humans and livestock, AMR is still common in remote wildlife populations with little direct human influence. Most reports of AMR in wildlife are survey based and/or small scale, so researchers can only speculate on possible sources and sinks of AMR or the impact of wildlife AMR on clinical resistance. This lack of quantitative data on the flow of AMR genes and AMR bacteria across the natural environment could reflect the numerous AMR sources and amplifiers in the populated world. Ecosystems with relatively simple and well-characterized potential inputs of AMR can provide tractable, but realistic, systems for studying AMR in the natural environment. New tools, such as animal tracking technologies and high-throughput sequencing of resistance genes and mobilomes, should be integrated with existing methodologies to understand how wildlife maintains and disperses AMR.","AI","University of Liverpool"

However, the results of a few recent studies carried out in this area have produced controversies. There is evidence that human fecal samples, used in most human microbiome studies, may provide a poor representation of microbial contents of the proximal intestine. Furthermore, fecal short chain fatty acid levels do not exemplify the amount of short chain fatty acids produced in the intestine. Short chain fatty acids are largely absorbed in the intestine by a tightly regulated mechanism. Here we present an exemplar study showing that the determination of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the precise mode of action of a LCS on gut microbiota allows for rational and scientifically-based recommendations.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"The neoliberalisation of climate? Progressing climate policy under austerity urbanism.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3004770/","North, PJ; Nurse, A; Barker, T","December 2016","While the urban is identified as a productive site for addressing climate change, the ‘post-political’ critique dismisses climate policy as a vacuous discourse that obscures power relations and exclusion, defends the established neoliberal order, and silences challenges. This paper argues that rather than consensus, there is a conflict between urban climate policy and the need to reignite economic growth in the context of austerity urbanism, but also that we should not assume that challenges to neoliberal understandings of the ‘sensible’ will always be disregarded. Rather, urban climate policy can be progressed through partnership processes utilising ‘co-production’ techniques which entail significant agonistic, if not antagonistic, contestation. The argument is illustrated with a case study of climate policy making in the context of austerity urbanism in Liverpool, UK. While ‘low carbon’ is conceptualised by elite actors in Liverpool in neoliberal terms as a source of new low carbon jobs and businesses, with an emphasis on energy security and fuel poverty, this view is not unchallenged. The paper recounts how an ad hoc group of actors in the city came together to form a partnership advocating for more strategic decarbonisation, which should be progressed through a bid for the city to be European Green Capital. The disputes that emerged around this agenda suggest that in the context of austerity urbanism the need for cities to act to mitigate against dangerous climate change is not as uncontested as conceptions of the post-political suggest.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The MWRI-01 study was done to characterise the safety, acceptability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of long-acting rilpivirine.<h4>Methods</h4>We did a phase 1 open-label study at the University of Pittsburgh. We enrolled healthy individuals (aged 18-45 years) who were seronegative for HIV-1. Participants were assigned alternately one intramuscular dose of either 1200 mg or 600 mg long-acting rilpivirine, beginning with the 1200 mg dose. We obtained plasma specimens, genital and rectal fluids, and tissue samples (rectal, cervical, and vaginal) before and after exposure to long-acting rilpivirine for assessment of pharmacokinetics and ex-vivo biopsy challenge with HIV-1. Our primary objective was to characterise product safety, and the analysis included all enrolled participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01656018.<h4>Findings</h4>36 participants were enrolled into the study, of whom 24 were women and 12 men. 12 women and six men received each dose. 204 adverse events were reported among the 36 participants, of which 200 (98%) were grade 1-2. The most common adverse event was injection site reaction. All grade 3 and 4 adverse events were deemed not related to rilpivirine. Geometric mean (90% CI) concentrations in plasma of rilpivirine at day 28 post dose were 53 ng/mL (38-67) in women and 43 ng/mL (23-63) in men for the 1200 mg dose and 28 ng/mL (19-37) in women and 17 ng/mL (9-24) in men for the 600 mg dose. The tissue-to-plasma ratio for rilpivirine in rectal tissue was about two-fold higher than in vaginal and cervical tissue (1·10-1·53 vs 0·61-0·72 and 0·50-0·71, respectively). Exposure to long-acting rilpivirine suppressed viral replication significantly in rectal tissue (p<0·0001), and this suppression persisted for up to 4 months. By contrast, no viral suppression was seen in cervical or vaginal tissue.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Ongoing research will characterise longer term safety and acceptability of multiple injections and help ascertain whether long-acting rilpivirine should advance to assessment of efficacy in preventing HIV-1 infection.<h4>Funding</h4>Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.","AI","University of Liverpool"

We review 20 years of research and discover that the pioneer measure of entrepreneurial attitudes as a predictor of self-employment intentions, has yet to be empirically validated. We show that construct and measurement differences, one-off modifications to existing scales and a lack of adequate justification may partially explain why studies in the entrepreneurship education domain have produced inconsistent results. We address this limitation by performing factor analytic techniques on data from two sets of English-speaking university students from two North American countries.

Our panel-data analysis of Chinese EMEs shows that although host-country institutional development on average enhances innovation performance of the parent, such effects are more pronounced for EMEs with strong absorptive capacity and for those diversifying into a larger number of countries. Interestingly, EMEs with a higher level of state ownership gain more when entering countries with a lower level of institutional development.

As a result, how academic collaborations influence innovation in emerging countries, which differ fundamentally from developed countries in their institutional environment, remains unclear. We contribute to this literature by examining how collaborations with universities and research institutes influence the ability of Chinese emerging market enterprises (EMEs) to develop innovations. Our analysis challenges the assumption of institutional homogeneity within a given country, showing that institutions evolve in different ways across sub-national Chinese regions. This uneven institutional evolution affects the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs), the level of international openness, the quality of universities and research institutes across regions and thus the degree to which Chinese EMEs benefit from academic collaborations. Our findings reveal that sub-national institutional variations have a profound impact on the relationship between academic collaborations and firms’ innovation performance, illustrate that some established assumptions are not valid in emerging countries, such as China, and offer insights into how EMEs can enhance their innovation performance.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Harvesting big data to enhance supply chain innovation capabilities: An analytic infrastructure based on deduction graph.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3005171/","Tan, Kim Hua; Zhan, YuanZhu; Ji, Guojun; Ye, Fei; Chang, Chingter","January 2017","Today, firms can access to big data (tweets, videos, click streams, and other unstructured sources) to extract new ideas or understanding about their products, customers, and markets. Thus, managers increasingly view data as an important driver of innovation and a significant source of value creation and competitive advantage. To get the most out of the big data (in combination with a firm׳s existing data), a more sophisticated way of handling, managing, analysing and interpreting data is necessary. However, there is a lack of data analytics techniques to assist firms to capture the potential of innovation afforded by data and to gain competitive advantage. This research aims to address this gap by developing and testing an analytic infrastructure based on the deduction graph technique. The proposed approach provides an analytic infrastructure for firms to incorporate their own competence sets with other firms. Case studies results indicate that the proposed data analytic approach enable firms to utilise big data to gain competitive advantage by enhancing their supply chain innovation capabilities.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Improving new product development using big data: a case study of an electronics company.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3005172/","Tan, KH; Zhan, Y","January 2017","Big data is becoming more important to the new product development (NPD) efforts of global firms. Although the term of big data is not new, very few studies have investigated how firms can harvest big data to facilitate NPD. The purpose of this article is to present the means by which big data can be used to assist firms in NPD to shorten the time to market, improving customers’ product adoption and reducing costs. This research is based on a two‐step approach. First, we identified and analysed three world‐leading firms that have successfully integrated big data in supporting their NPD. Then, the observations from the firms were used to determine the principle involved in leveraging big data to reduce product development lead times and costs. Given the exploratory nature of the research objective, a participant‐observation case study is adopted in which during a 6‐month period a NPD project in a fast moving high‐tech industry was investigated. This study provides empirical confirmation for the three principles to big data supported NPD: (a) Autonomy; (b) Connection; and (c) Ecosystem. It is termed the ACE principles which we believe represent a paradigm shift to help firms unlock the power of big data and make NPD faster and less costly. This article provides guideline to firms in harvesting big data to better support their NPD: it allows organisations to launch new products to market as quickly as possible; it helps organisations to determine the weaknesses of the product earlier in the development cycle; it allows functionalities to be added to a product that customers are willing to pay a premium for, while eliminating features they do not want; and it identifies and then prioritises customer needs for specific markets.","AI","University of Liverpool"

By acquiring this information, managers can gain opportunities to develop customer-centred products. Big data can be defined as multimedia-rich and interactive low-cost information resulting from mass communication. It offers customers a better understanding of new products and provides new, simplified modes of large-scale interaction between customers and firms. Although previous studies have pointed out that firms can better understand customers’ preferences and needs by leveraging different types of available data, the situation is evolving, with increasing application of big data analytics for product development, operations and supply chain management. In order to utilise the customer information available from big data to a larger extent, managers need to identify how to establish a customer-involving environment that encourages customers to share their ideas with managers, contribute their know-how, fiddle around with new products, and express their actual preferences. We investigate a new product development project at an electronics company, STE, and describe how big data is used to connect to, interact with and involve customers in new product development in practice. Our findings reveal that big data can offer customer involvement so as to provide valuable input for developing new products. In this paper, we introduce a customer involvement approach as a new means of coming up with customer-centred new product development.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Characteristic retinopathy refines cerebral malaria (CM) diagnosis, enabling more precise exploration of the hypothesis that HIV decreases the cytokine response in CM, leading to higher parasite density and a poor outcome.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively reviewed data on clinical progression and laboratory parameters in 877 retinopathy-positive CM cases admitted 1996-2011 (14.4% HIV-infected) to a large hospital in Malawi. Admission plasma levels of TNF, interleukin-10, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1) were measured by ELISA in 135 retinopathy-positive CM cases.<h4>Results</h4>HIV-infected CM cases had lower median plasma levels of TNF (p = 0.008), interleukin-10 (p = 0.045) and sICAM-1 (p = 0.04) than HIV-uninfected cases. Although HIV-infected children were older and more likely to have co-morbidities, HIV-status did not significantly affect parasite density (p = 0.90) or outcome (24.8% infected, vs. 18.5% uninfected; p = 0.13).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this well-characterised CM cohort, HIV-coinfection was associated with marked blunting of the inflammatory response but did not affect parasite density or outcome. These data highlight the complex influence of HIV on severe malaria and bring into question systemic inflammation as a primary driver of pathogenesis in human CM.","AI","University of Liverpool"

According to the simulated results, the electric and magnetic resonances at visible wavelengths are obtained in the tips and contours of the metamaterials made of the quasi-3D bowtie nanoantennas, respectively. The effects of the size and gap of quasi-3D bowtie nanoantennas on the array performance have also been studied.

To this end, we associate inventors with specific knowledge elements in the firm’s knowledge network and examine how this association affects the inventors’ popularity and activity in a work-related advice network. Empirically, we combine survey data on 135 inventors working in a German high-tech firm with information derived from the firm’s 1031 patents. Results from multilevel exponential random graph models (ERGM) show that different dimensions of knowledge derived from the firm’s knowledge network shape the transfer of advice among inventors in unique ways. Thus, our study demonstrates how structural features of the firm’s knowledge stock influence interpersonal interactions among its inventors thereby affecting the intra-organizational diffusion of knowledge and the recombinant possibilities of the firm.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Here, we show that spectral domain Line Field (LF) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is able to return to the user a cross sectional B-Scan image in a single shot with no mechanical moving parts. To reliably extract layer thicknesses from such images of automotive paint systems, we present an automatic graph search image segmentation algorithm. To show that the algorithm works independently of the OCT device, the measurements are repeated with a separate time domain Full Field (FF) OCT system. This gives matching mean thickness values within the standard deviations of the measured thicknesses across each B-Scan image. The combination of an LF-OCT with graph search segmentation is potentially a powerful technique for the quality assurance of non-opaque industrial coating layers.","AI","University of Liverpool"

In the 3-year assessment of the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial we aimed to evaluate the proportion of individuals with prediabetes who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults with prediabetes and a body-mass index of at least 30 kg/m 2, or at least 27 kg/m 2 with comorbidities, were randomised 2:1, using a telephone or web-based system, to once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide 3·0 mg or matched placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Time to diabetes onset by 160 weeks was the primary outcome, evaluated in all randomised treated individuals with at least one post-baseline assessment. The trial was conducted at 191 clinical research sites in 27 countries and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01272219. Findings The study ran between June 1, 2011, and March 2, 2015. We randomly assigned 2254 patients to receive liraglutide (n=1505) or placebo (n=749). 1128 (50%) participants completed the study up to week 160, after withdrawal of 714 (47%) participants in the liraglutide group and 412 (55%) participants in the placebo group. By week 160, 26 (2%) of 1472 individuals in the liraglutide group versus 46 (6%) of 738 in the placebo group were diagnosed with diabetes while on treatment. The mean time from randomisation to diagnosis was 99 (SD 47) weeks for the 26 individuals in the liraglutide group versus 87 (47) weeks for the 46 individuals in the placebo group. Taking the different diagnosis frequencies between the treatment groups into account, the time to onset of diabetes over 160 weeks among all randomised individuals was 2·7 times longer with liraglutide than with placebo (95% CI 1·9 to 3·9, p<0·0001), corresponding with a hazard ratio of 0·21 (95% CI 0·13–0·34). Liraglutide induced greater weight loss than placebo at week 160 (–6·1 [SD 7·3] vs −1·9% [6·3]; estimated treatment difference −4·3%, 95% CI −4·9 to −3·7, p<0·0001). Serious adverse events were reported by 227 (15%) of 1501 randomised treated individuals in the liraglutide group versus 96 (13%) of 747 individuals in the placebo group. Interpretation In this trial, we provide results for 3 years of treatment, with the limitation that withdrawn individuals were not followed up after discontinuation. Liraglutide 3·0 mg might provide health benefits in terms of reduced risk of diabetes in individuals with obesity and prediabetes.","AI","University of Liverpool"

A multivariate binomial regression was used to examine the data.ResultsThirteen studies were included with ten contributing to the meta-analysis. The average quality assessment score (NOS) was 5.3 out of a possible nine, only one paper achieved eight. At patient level mucositis ranged from 18.5-74.2% and peri-implantitis from 8-28%, with significant effects being seen for treatment (z= -14.36, p<0.001). Mucositis was affected by history of periodontitis and mean PIMT at implant and patient levels, respectively. For peri-implantitis there were also significant effects of treatment (z = -16.63, p<0.001). Increased peri-implantitis was observed for patients with a history of periodontal disease. (z=3.76, p<0.001). Implants under PIMT have 0.958 the incident event compared to those with no PIMT.ConclusionsWithin the limitations of the present systematic review it can be concluded that implant therapy must not be limited to placement and restoration of dental implants, but to the implementation of PIMT to potentially prevent biological complications and heighten the long-term success rate. Although it must be tailored to a patients risk profiling, our findings suggest reason to claim a minimum recall PIMT interval of five to six months. Additionally, it must be stressed that even in the establishment of PIMT, biological complications might occur. Hence, patient-, clinical-, and implant-related factors must be thoroughly explored.","AI","University of Liverpool"

We reviewed all original literature (qualitative and quantitative) to understand the current scope of CDSS for antimicrobial management and analyse existing methods used to evaluate and report such systems.<h4>Method</h4>PRISMA guidelines were followed. Medline, EMBASE, HMIC Health and Management and Global Health databases were searched from 1 January 1980 to 31 October 2015. All primary research studies describing CDSS for antimicrobial management in adults in primary or secondary care were included. For qualitative studies, thematic synthesis was performed. Quality was assessed using Integrated quality Criteria for the Review Of Multiple Study designs (ICROMS) criteria. CDSS reporting was assessed against a reporting framework for behaviour change intervention implementation.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-eight original articles were included describing 38 independent CDSS. The majority of systems target antimicrobial prescribing (29/38;76%), are platforms integrated with electronic medical records (28/38;74%), and have a rules-based infrastructure providing decision support (29/38;76%). On evaluation against the intervention reporting framework, CDSS studies fail to report consideration of the non-expert, end-user workflow. They have narrow focus, such as antimicrobial selection, and use proxy outcome measures. Engagement with CDSS by clinicians was poor.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Greater consideration of the factors that drive non-expert decision making must be considered when designing CDSS interventions. Future work must aim to expand CDSS beyond simply selecting appropriate antimicrobials with clear and systematic reporting frameworks for CDSS interventions developed to address current gaps identified in the reporting of evidence.","AI","University of Liverpool"

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vildagliptin in the Brazilian context. Areas covered: Using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Lilacs and CRD, six studies were selected for the economic models. This study utilised cost data in the Brazilian health system to provide the context. Expert commentary: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an epidemic disease and represents a challenge for all health care systems. Although guidelines clearly define first-line treatment, there are several other promising treatments. Vildagliptin is one of them, resulting in a mean lifetime increase of 0.31 years compared to metformin alone and 1.19 more life years compared to other metformin combinations. Considering observational data, life years with dual vildagliptin-containing treatments were 0.37 more compared to other dual treatments. However, its high cost versus generic metformin and its unclear safety profile weakens its subsequent cost-effectiveness. Consequently, the incorporation of vildagliptin or its combination with metformin is currently not recommended for the Brazilian Health Care System. This may change as more data becomes available.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"VR or Not VR-No Longer a Question?","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008399/","Dokonal, W; Knight, M; Dengg, E","July 2017","Virtual Reality (VR) software has developed to the point where, for the architect who is averagely technically adept, it can be incorporated into the design process with reasonable effort and costs. For VR to be an effective design tool, it must add value to the design process and should give insights and opportunities not available by other methods.Previous research by the authors reported on the results of an international student workshop which focused both on the workflow (to prepare the architectural models for the new VR systems) and the spatial perception that users experienced. In this paper, we continue to explore the question: ""Can low cost VR be an effective addition to the architects' design toolbox, or does it still remain a ""far-fetched, high-tech expensive folly?""To do this we are working with a larger group of students, a more developed workflow and we are also expanding this to architects in practice. We will be assessing both the practicality of integrating VR into the design workflow and the spatial perception of the designer when interacting with the model. We are experimenting with additional interface tools.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Molecular Communication over Gas Stream Channels using Portable Mass Spectrometry.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008657/","Giannoukos, S; Marshall, A; Taylor, S; Smith, J","July 2017","The synthetic generation/coding and transmission of olfactory information over a gas stream or an odor network is a new and unexplored field. Application areas vary from the entertainment or advertisement industry to security and telemedicine. However, current technological limitations frustrate the accurate reproduction of decoded and transmitted olfactory data. This study describes the development, testing, and characterization of a novel odor emitter (OE) that is used to investigate the generation-encoding of gaseous standards with odorous characteristics with a regulatable way, for scent transmission purposes. The calibration and the responses of a developed OE were examined using a portable quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS). Experiments were undertaken for a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at different temperatures and flow rates. Individual compounds and mixtures were tested to investigate periodic and dynamic transmission characteristics within two different size tubular containers for distances up to 3 m. Olfactory information transmission is demonstrated using MS as the main molecular sensor for odor detection and monitoring and for the first time spatial encryption of olfactory information is shown.

"Knowledge of hypertension and its management among hypertensive patients on chronic medicines at primary health care public sector facilities in South Africa; findings and implications.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008825/","Rampamba, Enos M; Meyer, Johanna C; Helberg, Elvera; Godman, Brian","August 2017","<h4>Background</h4>There are high growing prevalence rates of hypertension in South Africa. Consequently, there is a need to assess knowledge and management among hypertensive patients receiving chronic medication from primary health care (PHC) facilities in South Africa as a basis for improving future management. This is important as South Africa seeks to improve its management of chronic diseases.<h4>Methods</h4>Descriptive, quantitative study amongst chronic hypertensive patients in the chronic disease programme. Patients were interviewed face-to-face by trained pharmacists using a structured questionnaire. Data analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Half (53.7%) of the patients had uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Less than a third of patients (27.7%) knew what hypertension is, the meaning of recorded BP numbers (4.5%), and what normal BP should be (19.9%). All patients who knew the meaning of BP numbers had formal education (p = 0.047). Only 15.6% of the 56.0% patients, who received hypertension information, received it on antihypertensive medicines specifically.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of the patients lacked hypertension specific knowledge and only half had controlled BP. Interventions to improve the control of high BP should be targeted at closing knowledge gaps as part of the current chronic treatment initiatives in South Africa to ensure the benefits of increased access to care are realized.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Structure and activities of Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees among Public Hospitals in South Africa; findings and implications.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008837/","Matlala, M; Gous, AGS; Godman, B; Meyer, JC","August 2017","<h4>Introduction</h4>The WHO identified Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees (PTCs) as a pivotal model to promote rational medicine use in hospitals. This matches a key South African (SA) government objective to establish PTCs in all hospitals to ensure rational, efficient and cost-effective use of medicines. However, documentation on the functionality of PTCs in public hospitals in SA is limited. Areas covered: This study aimed to address this. A 3-phased mixed methods approach involving questionnaires, observations of PTC meetings and semi-structured interviews was used. The findings were converged during the interpretation phase. Expert commentary: Most professionals were represented in the PTCs, with variations across hospitals. Membership of PTCs included a pharmacist, who in the majority of cases was the secretary. PTC activities included dissemination of decisions (100%) and formulary management (89.5%). However, reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and medication errors was typically poor at all hospital levels. Lack of expertise of pharmacoeconomic analysis and evidence-based decision-making in formulary management was identified as a key challenge in formulary management. In conclusion, future programmes should strengthen PTCs in specialised aspects of formulary management. Further training in the principles of pharmacovigilance is needed to enhance ADR reporting, as well as to ensure compliance with both WHO and provincial guidelines.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Polycentric development practice in master planning: the case of China.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3008866/","Cheng, Hui; Shaw, David","August 2017","Towards the end of the twentieth century, polycentricity was introduced into China as a planning concept. Subsequently a number of super/mega city regions began to adopt polycentric development spatial planning strategies, which are designed to facilitate more sustainable and balanced development. This paper seeks to identify the main differences in application of polycentricity between China and the West, and explore the major emerging thematic strands of polycentric development practice, as illustrated through an evaluation of master planning in eight super/mega city regions across China. In particular, the paper highlights the divergent interpretations of polycentricity in master plan-making practice and shows how plans have been adjusted to help deliver the idea of polycentric development. Although the concept of polycentricity is relatively new in China, it has already become a normative approach used to determine future spatial structures. While there is an absence of an articulated rationality to ‘decide’ whether this is (or should be) an ‘ideal’ model, already it has gone beyond Western approaches of initially using polycentricity as an interpretative tool to describe urban realities.","AI","University of Liverpool"

In this context, additive manufacturing brings the possibility of making electrodes and electrical energy storage devices in any desired three-dimensional (3D) shape and dimensions, while preserving the multifunctional properties of the active materials in terms of surface area and conductivity. This paves the way to optimized and more efficient designs for energy devices. Here, we describe how three-dimensional (3D) printing will allow the fabrication of bespoke devices, with complex geometries, tailored to fit specific requirements and applications, by designing water-based thermoresponsive inks to 3D-print different materials in one step, for example, printing the active material precursor (reduced chemically modified graphene (rCMG)) and the current collector (copper) for supercapacitors or anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The formulation of thermoresponsive inks using Pluronic F127 provides an aqueous-based, robust, flexible, and easily upscalable approach. The devices are designed to provide low resistance interface, enhanced electrical properties, mechanical performance, packing of rCMG, and low active material density while facilitating the postprocessing of the multicomponent 3D-printed structures. The electrode materials are selected to match postprocessing conditions. The reduction of the active material (rCMG) and sintering of the current collector (Cu) take place simultaneously. The electrochemical performance of the rCMG-based self-standing binder-free electrode and the two materials coupled rCMG/Cu printed electrode prove the potential of multimaterial printing in energy applications.","AI","University of Liverpool"

They developed the key hypothesis on foreign market entry through CBAs by incorporating insights from transaction costs economics, the resource‐based view and institutional theory to investigate the determinants of full versus partial equity ownership. Using logistic regression estimation methods to a sample of 111 CBA deals of BRICS MNEs in 22 European countries, it was found that BRICS MNEs were likely to pursue full rather than partial acquisition mode when target firms have high R&D capabilities. However, the greater the degree of strength of IP institutions in target economies and higher the target firms’ R&D capabilities, the more likely it is for BRICS MNEs to undertake partial, rather than, full acquisition mode. They provided interesting theoretical insights and managerial implications that might underlie some of the key findings on CBAs by emerging market MNEs.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Our panel data analysis of Chinese EMEs shows that OFDI has a positive effect on innovation performance of Chinese EMEs’ subsidiaries and that this effect is stronger when the OFDI is directed towards developed rather than emerging countries. These findings advance the notion that EMEs can use OFDI as a strategy to globalize R&D and enhance their innovation performance and demonstrate that certain established assumptions regarding organizational learning are not valid for EMEs.","AI","University of Liverpool"

A Comparison of Personal Web Site and Social Media Use by Candidates at the 2010 UK General Election.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3011455/","Southern, Rosalynd","November 2017","The apparent success of President Obama’s online election campaigns in the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections and the rapid growth in use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter by British voters since the last election has led to much speculation that 2010 would be a “watershed” moment for UK politicians and parties in their adoption of digital tools. This article seeks to measure the precise extent of online campaigning during the 2010 general election campaign and explain the patterns of adoption observed. It does so by using an extensive and original data set that measures the adoption of Web sites by candidates from six parties in all constituencies in England, and measures adoption and use of four types of social media for a smaller group of more competitive constituencies. It aims to test one of the leading theories in the field of online campaigning, the normalization thesis, using the most comprehensive and rigorous data collected in the United Kingdom to date. The normalization thesis states that actors who already have the most influence will be the ones most likely to benefit from new online campaign methods. This paper finds that although patterns of Web site adoption among candidates do support normalization overall, adoption and use of certain types of social media refute normalization on some measures, some to a strong degree.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The model presented can have arbitrary boundary conditions specified in terms of elastic constraints in the translations and rotations or even in terms of attached lumped masses and inertias. Each displacement function is universally expressed as a linear combination of a standard Fourier cosine series and several supplementary functions introduced to ensure and accelerate the convergence of the series expansion. Lagrange's equation is established for all the unknown Fourier coefficients viewed as a set of independent generalized coordinates. A numerical model is constructed for the rotating beam. First, a numerical example considering simply supported boundary conditions at both ends is calculated and the results are compared with those of a published paper to show the accuracy and convergence of the proposed model. Then, the method is applied to one real work piece structure with elastically supported boundary conditions updated from the modal experiment results including both the frequencies and mode shapes using the method of least squares. Several numerical examples of the updated model are studied to show the effects of some parameters on the dynamic characteristics of the work piece subjected to moving loads at different constant velocities. </jats:p>","AI","University of Liverpool"

The structural vibration is investigated based on a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) code using harmonic response analysis. The computation of hydrodynamic noise is based on a hybrid LES/Lighthill's acoustic analogy method and sound sources are solved as volume sources in commercial software ACTRAN.

"Synthesis of Protocols and Discrete Controllers.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3012297/","Husien, IM","December 2017","In this thesis, a number of search techniques are proposed as a solution for program and discrete controller synthesis (DCS). Classic synthesis techniques facilitate exhaus- tive search, while genetic programming has recently proven the potential of generic search techniques. But is genetic programming the right search technique for the synthesis prob- lem? In this thesis we challenge this belief and argue in favor of simulated annealing, a different class of general search techniques. We show that, in hindsight, the success of genetic programming has drawn from what is arguably a hybrid between simulated annealing and genetic programming, and compare the fitness of classic genetic program- ming, the hybrid form, and pure simulated annealing. Our experimental evaluation suggests that pure simulated annealing offers better results for automated programming than techniques based on genetic programming. Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) and Program Synthesis have similar goals: they are automated techniques to infer a control strategy and an implementation, respectively, that is correct by construction. We also investigate the application of the search tech- niques that we have been used for program synthesis for the computation of deterministic strategies solving symbolic Discrete Controller Synthesis (DCS) problems, where a model of the system under control is given along with desired objective behaviours. We experi- mentally confirm that relative performance results are similar to program synthesis, and give a complexity analysis of our simulated annealing algorithm for symbolic DCS. From the performance results we obtain, we draw the conclusion that simulated annealing, when combined with efficient model-checking techniques, is worth further investigating to solve symbolic DCS problems. A tool is designed to explore the parameter space of different synthesis techniques. Besides using it to synthesise a discrete control strategies for reactive systems (controller synthesis) and for protocol adapters for the coordination of different threads (software synthesis), we can also use it to study the influence of turning various screws in the syn- thesis process. For simulated annealing, PranCS allows the user to define the behaviour of the cooling schedule. For genetic programming, the user can select the population size.","AI","University of Liverpool"

However, the current levels of adherence to reporting guidelines are suboptimal. Over the last few years, several actions aiming to improve compliance with reporting guidelines have been taken and proposed. We will conduct a scoping review of interventions to improve adherence to reporting guidelines in health research that have been evaluated or suggested, in order to inform future interventions.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Our review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methods manual. We will search for relevant studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Moreover, we will carry out lateral searches from the reference lists of the included studies, as well as from the lists of articles citing the included ones. One reviewer will screen the full list, which will be randomly split into two halves and independently screened by the other two reviewers. Two reviewers will perform data extraction independently. Discrepancies will be solved through discussion. In addition, this search strategy will be supplemented by a grey literature search. The interventions found will be classified as assessed or suggested, as well as according to different criteria, in relation to their target (journal policies, journal editors, authors, reviewers, funders, ethical boards or others) or the research stage at which they are performed (design, conducting, reporting or peer review). Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>A paper summarising the findings from this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This scoping review will contribute to a better understanding and a broader perspective on how the problem of adhering better to reporting guidelines has been tackled so far. This could be a major first step towards developing future strategies to improve compliance with reporting guidelines in health research.","AI","University of Liverpool"

However, it is unclear if such drivers interact to affect assemblage body size distributions. We asked how these two key global change drivers differentially affect the interspecific size distributions of ants, one of the most abundant and ubiquitous animal groups on earth. We also asked whether there is evidence of synergistic interactions and whether effects are related to species’ trophic roles. We generated a global dataset on ant body size from 333 local ant assemblages collected by the authors across a broad range of climates and in disturbed and undisturbed habitats. We used head length (range: 0.22–4.55 mm) as a surrogate of body size and classified species to trophic groups. We used generalized linear models to test whether body size distributions changed with climate and disturbance, independent of species richness. Our analysis yielded three key results: 1) climate and disturbance showed independent associations with body size; 2) assemblages included more small species in warmer climates and fewer large species in wet climates; and 3) both the largest and smallest species were absent from disturbed ecosystems, with predators most affected in both cases. Our results indicate that temperature, precipitation and disturbance have differing effects on the body size distributions of local communities, with no evidence of synergistic interactions. Further, both large and small predators may be vulnerable to global change, particularly through habitat disturbance.</jats:p>","AI","University of Liverpool"

However, despite this rise in technology numerous authors have commented on the shortfall in efficacy studies to assess the impact such technology-enhanced learning (TEL) resources have on learning. To assess the range of evaluation approaches to TEL across anatomy education, a systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, the Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Scopus, and Google Scholar, with a total of 3,345 articles retrieved. Following the PRISMA method for reporting items, 153 articles were identified and reviewed against a published framework-the technology-enhanced learning evaluation model (TELEM). The model allowed published reports to be categorized according to evaluations at the level of (1) learner satisfaction, (2) learning gain, (3) learner impact, and (4) institutional impact. The results of this systematic review reveal that most evaluation studies into TEL within anatomy curricula were based on learner satisfaction, followed by module or course learning outcomes. Randomized controlled studies assessing learning gain with a specific TEL resource were in a minority, with no studies reporting a comprehensive assessment on the overall impact of introducing a specific TEL resource (e.g., return on investment). This systematic review has provided clear evidence that anatomy education is engaged in evaluating the impact of TEL resources on student education, although it remains at a level that fails to provide comprehensive causative evidence.

However, the known duality of ROS molecules as both damaging agents and cellular redox signals implies another perspective in the study of sustained oxidative stress. This is a perspective of studying oxidative stress as a constitutive signal within the cell. In this work, we adopt a theoretical perspective as an exploratory and explanatory approach to examine how chronic oxidative stress can interfere with signal processing by redox signalling pathways in the cell. We report that constitutive signals can give rise to a ‘molecular habituation’ effect that can prime for a gradual loss of biological function. This is because a constitutive signal in the environment has the potential to reduce the responsiveness of a signalling pathway through the prolonged activation of negative regulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how this phenomenon is likely to occur in different signalling pathways exposed to persistent signals and furthermore at different levels of biological organisation.","AI","University of Liverpool"

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first edition of this journal, this review covers the development of understanding and practice of inhalational anaesthesia and controlled ventilation in horses over the last 50 years. We review how the perceived benefits of halothane led to its widespread use, but subsequently better understanding of halothane's effects led to changes in equine anaesthetic practice and the utilisation of different inhalation agents (e.g. isoflurane and sevoflurane). We discuss how more recently, better understanding of the effects of the 'newer' inhalation agents' effects has led to yet more changes in equine anaesthetic practice, and while, further new inhalation agents are unlikely to appear in the near future, further enhancements to anaesthetic practice may still lead to improved outcomes. We review advances in our understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the equine lung as well of the effects of anaesthesia on lung function and how these predispose to some of the common problems of gas exchange and ventilation during anaesthesia. We identify the aims of optimal mechanical ventilation for anaesthetic management and whether the various methods of ventilatory support during equine anaesthesia achieve them. We also highlight that further developments in equipment and optimal ventilator modes are likely in the near future.","AI","University of Liverpool"

While recognizing the importance of competition in innovation, we address this question by examining the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of private high-tech new ventures. We argue that the impact of foreign and domestic competition on the innovation performance of local private firms may vary, due to the different types of resource interdependence with their competitors and learning gained by private firms. To test these arguments, we conducted a multilevel analysis of 805 Chinese private high-tech firms over the period 2001–2007. Our findings suggest that foreign competition has a U-shaped relationship with the innovation performance of private firms, whereas competition from state-owned enterprises positively affects private firms’ innovation performance. Our study moves beyond the debate on whether competition increases or decreases innovation by unpacking the differential effects exerted by different types of competitors on the innovation performance of local private firms in the context of a transition economy.","AI","University of Liverpool"

In this study, the oxidation characteristics of petroleum-based IG-110 and pitch-based IG-430 graphite pellets in helium and air environments at temperatures ranging from 700 to 1600 °C were investigated. The oxidation rates and activation energies were determined based on mass loss measurements in a series of oxidation tests. The surface morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Although the thermal oxidation mechanism was previously considered to be the same for all temperatures higher than 1000 °C, the significant increases in oxidation rate observed at very high temperatures suggest that the oxidation behavior of the selected graphite materials at temperatures higher than 1200 °C is different. This work demonstrates that changes in surface morphology and in oxidation rate of the filler particles in the graphite materials are more prominent at temperatures above 1200 °C. Furthermore, possible intrinsic factors contributing to the oxidation of the two graphite materials at different temperature ranges are discussed taking account of the dominant role played by temperature.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Prospects for a Transparency Revolution in the Field of Business History.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3017756/","Smith, Andrew; Umemura, Maki","February 2018","The last five years have seen is an increasing emphasis on research transparency in many disciplines. Unfortunately, the field of business history is being bypassed by the movement for the creation of research transparency institutions. The article begins by showing why it is important for the business history community to engage with the research transparency movement by embracing the principle of Open Data. The article then argues that Active Citation is the right variant of Open Data for the business–history community and that the widespread adoption of Active Citation in the field of business history would be promoted by the creation of a specialised repository for business–historical research data. The challenges involved in establishing such a repository are discussed. The article concludes by arguing that business historical journals and monograph publishers should not require authors to use Active Citation; rather, contributors should merely be required to state whether they have made the data underlying their article available online.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Mechanisms of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of BOPP.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3017839/","Sawtell, David AG; Abd-Allah, Zaenab; Bradley, James W; West, Glen T; Kelly, Peter J","February 2018","<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Surface energy increase of polymers with plasma treatment is an industrially significant process. The mechanisms behind this process are little understood, with work addressing the water contact angle decrease with treatment and changes in surface chemistry. Work presented here addresses the mechanism of this surface energy increase, by using crystalline biaxially orientated polypropylene (BOPP) films to identify plasma induced structural changes. Increased crystallinity of the BOPP films were observed by ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy, indicating preferential oxidation of amorphous regions of the BOPP films by the plasma. This crystal structure change correlates with XRD peak shifts, implying relaxation of crystal regions into regions previously occupied by amorphous BOPP. The trend in surface energy increases also correlates with the effective increase in crystallinity.<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""graphic/ppap201700051-gra-0001.png"" xlink:title=""ppap201700051-gra-0001"" /></jats:p></jats:sec>","AI","University of Liverpool"

It seems to be the most developed and established process for light water reactor fuel and the use of solid fuel. However, demand driven development of the nuclear system opens the way to liquid fuelled reactors, and disruptive technology development through the application of an integrated fuel cycle with a direct link to reactor operation. The possibilities of this new concept for innovative reprocessing technology development are analysed, the boundary conditions are discussed, and the economic as well as the neutron physical optimization parameters of the process are elucidated. Reactor physical knowledge of the influence of different elements on the neutron economy of the reactor is required. Using an innovative study approach, an element priority list for the salt clean-up is developed, which indicates that separation of Neodymium and Caesium is desirable, as they contribute almost 50% to the loss of criticality. Separating Zirconium and Samarium in addition from the fuel salt would remove nearly 80% of the loss of criticality due to fission products. The theoretical study is followed by a qualitative discussion of the different, demand driven optimization strategies which could satisfy the conflicting interests of sustainable reactor operation, efficient chemical processing for the salt clean-up, and the related economic as well as chemical engineering consequences. A new, innovative approach of balancing the throughput through salt processing based on a low number of separation process steps is developed. Next steps for the development of an economically viable salt clean-up process are identified.","AI","University of Liverpool"

However, there is still a drive to improve the credibility and transferability of such research. In the current work four studies are presented which used similar methods. Standardised measures of cognitive function were administered to Authorised Firearms Officers (AFOs) after completion of immersive tactical training scenarios. The tests were chosen to examine differences between information modalities (e.g., visual vs. phonological). Results indicate that the demand associated with tactical training scenarios led to cognitive adaptions, resulting in a significant increase in visual processing capacity and reductions in phonological processing capacity. The findings indicate that an adaptive switch to visual information modality may underpin experience-based decision making by AFOs. The findings provide insight into why training and policy should keep verbal and auditory demands placed on AFOs to a minimum.","AI","University of Liverpool"

On the one hand, CEOs who receive more attention from retail investors may engage in tax evasion activities to meet investors' performance expectations; on the other hand, they are more concerned with public image and avoiding being labeled as tax avoiders. Based on the CEOs of S&P 500 firms between 2004 and 2011, our finding supports the former and shows that CEOs with higher publicity manage to have a lower effective tax rate and cash effective tax rate. Such effect is moderated by board independence. Finally, firms with higher CEO publicity pay auditors higher tax fees, suggesting that these CEOs tend to use more tax planning services from auditors.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Bayesian operational modal analysis of Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3019637/","Brownjohn, James Mark William; Au, Siu-Kui; Zhu, Yichen; Sun, Zhen; Li, Binbin; Bassitt, James; Hudson, Emma; Sun, Hongbin","April 2018","Vibration testing of long span bridges is becoming a commissioning requirement, yet such exercises represent the extreme of experimental capability, with challenges for instrumentation (due to frequency range, resolution and km-order separation of sensor) and system identification (because of the extreme low frequencies). The challenge with instrumentation for modal analysis is managing synchronous data acquisition from sensors distributed widely apart inside and outside the structure. The ideal solution is precisely synchronised autonomous recorders that do not need cables, GPS or wireless communication. The challenge with system identification is to maximise the reliability of modal parameters through experimental design and subsequently to identify the parameters in terms of mean values and standard errors. The challenge is particularly severe for modes with low frequency and damping typical of long span bridges. One solution is to apply ‘third generation’ operational modal analysis procedures using Bayesian approaches in both the planning and analysis stages. The paper presents an exercise on the Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, a suspension bridge with a 1385 m main span. The exercise comprised planning of a test campaign to optimise the reliability of operational modal analysis, the deployment of a set of independent data acquisition units synchronised using precision oven controlled crystal oscillators and the subsequent identification of a set of modal parameters in terms of mean and variance errors. Although the bridge has had structural health monitoring technology installed since it was completed, this was the first full modal survey, aimed at identifying important features of the modal behaviour rather than providing fine resolution of mode shapes through the whole structure. Therefore, measurements were made in only the (south) tower, while torsional behaviour was identified by a single measurement using a pair of recorders across the carriageway. The modal survey revealed a first lateral symmetric mode with natural frequency 0.0536 Hz with standard error ±3.6% and damping ratio 4.4% with standard error ±88%. First vertical mode is antisymmetric with frequency 0.11 Hz ± 1.2% and damping ratio 4.9% ± 41%. A significant and novel element of the exercise was planning of the measurement setups and their necessary duration linked to prior estimation of the precision of the frequency and damping estimates. The second novelty is the use of the multi-sensor precision synchronised acquisition without external time reference on a structure of this scale. The challenges of ambient vibration testing and modal identification in a complex environment are addressed leveraging on advances in practical implementation and scientific understanding of the problem.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Highly Efficient Wideband Harmonic-Tuned Power Amplifier Using Low-pass Matching Network.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3019980/","Rabbi, K; Zhou, J; Huang, Y; Zhuang, Y; McEwan, N; Rayit, A; Rayit, R; IEEE, ","January 2019","This paper presents a design approach for a broadband and high efficiency harmonic-tuned power amplifier (PA) based on a low-pass filtering (LPF) matching network (MN). The MN is composed of quasi-lumped open stubs (λg/8 λg/4). Compared with widely used conventional Chebyshev LPF matching networks, the proposed output matching network provides a good approximation of desired lumped elements over the entire frequency band. The MN offers a sharp roll-off to the transition band. Optimum fundamental and second harmonic load impedances are obtained by identifying the high efficiency regions on the reactance plane for second harmonic band placement, the design is reduced to a fundamental matching problem. A PA with this concept is designed from 1.0 to 1.5 GHz (FBW=40%) using a Cree GaN HEMT CGH40045. The peak output power, drain efficiency, and gain are 47.3 dBm, 80%, and 12.6 dB, respectively at 1.2 GHz. Furthermore, the PA is evaluated using a COFDM signal with an average output power of 40 dBm, a peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) of 10 dB, and a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz.

Detailed records were obtained over a 5-yr period (2010-2015) by questionnaires and qualitative interviews to investigate the practices adopted by dairy farmers to control cattle helminth infections and the factors associated with heifer exposure to O. ostertagi on pasture. In total, 1,454 heifers' individual milk samples were collected over a 1-yr period (2014-2015) in 43 dairy farms in England and tested for O. ostertagi antibody by ELISA. Multilevel linear regression models were used to investigate the association between individual milk optical density ratio (ODR) against O. ostertagi and heifer management from birth to time of sampling. Farm and heifer median ODR against O. ostertagi were 0.98 (interquartile range = 0.76-1.02) and 0.64 (interquartile range = 0.42-0.84), respectively. The majority of heifers (88%) received an anthelmintic treatment before sampling in this study. After controlling for the effect of anthelmintic treatments, heifer individual milk ODR against O. ostertagi significantly increased with high stocking rate at first grazing and co-grazing with adult cows before calving. Conversely, heifer individual milk ODR against O. ostertagi significantly decreased when heifers had co-grazed with sheep and pasture grass had frequently been mowed. Overall, these results provide evidence to support targeting grazing management toward limiting the use of anthelmintics in dairy young stock to enable sustainable control of cattle helminth infections in England. However, to be accepted and adopted by farmers, these best practices would need to take into account farmers' perspectives and contextual challenges.","AI","University of Liverpool"

We then use our findings from interviews with 23 young Saudi adults to add fine detail to what is known about uses and users of the new media. It is argued that although there has been no change up to now, the new media are very likely to be involved in the spread of support for further liberalization of uses of free time. We note that there has already been a seismic shift in Saudi political culture, which, as power passes to a new generation of young royals and government ministers, all in the context of the country’s need to rebalance its economy, make liberalization of out-of-home free time uses increasingly likely.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Endometrial vascular development in heavy menstrual bleeding: altered spatio-temporal expression of endothelial cell markers and extracellular matrix components.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3021699/","Shivhare, Sourima Biswas; Bulmer, Judith N; Innes, Barbara A; Hapangama, Dharani K; Lash, Gendie E","May 2018","STUDY QUESTION Are there any phenotypic and structural/architectural changes in the vessels of endometrium and superficial myometrium during the normal menstrual cycle in healthy women and those with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)?  SUMMARY ANSWER Spatial and temporal differences in protein levels of endothelial cell (EC) markers and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) were detected across the menstrual cycle in healthy women and these are altered in HMB.  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY HMB affects 30% of women of reproductive age with ~50% of cases being idiopathic. We have previously shown that the differentiation status of endometrial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is altered in women with HMB, suggesting altered vessel maturation compared to controls. Endometrial arteriogenesis requires the co-ordinated maturation not only of the VSMCs but also the underlying ECs and surrounding ECM. We hypothesized that there are spatial and temporal patterns of protein expression of EC markers and vascular ECM components in the endometrium across the menstrual cycle, which are altered in women with HMB.  STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Biopsies containing endometrium and superficial myometrium were taken from hysterectomy specimens from both healthy control women without endometrial pathology and women with subjective HMB in the proliferative (PP), early secretory (ESP), mid secretory (MSP) and late secretory (LSP) phases (N = 5 for each cycle phase and subject group). Samples were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax.  PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Serial sections (3μm thick) were immunostained for EC markers (factor VIII related antigen (F8RA), CD34, CD31 and ulex europaeus-agglutinin I (UEA-1) lectin), structural ECM markers (osteopontin, laminin, fibronectin and collagen IV) and for Ki67 to assess proliferation. Immunoreactivity of vessels in superficial myometrium, endometrial stratum basalis, stratum functionalis and luminal region was scored using either a modified Quickscore or by counting the number of positive vessels.  MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE In control samples, all four EC markers showed a dynamic expression pattern according to the menstrual cycle phase, in both endometrial and myometrial vessels. EC protein marker expression was altered in women with HMB compared with controls, especially in the secretory phase in the endometrial luminal region and stratum functionalis. For example, in the LSP expression of UEA-1 and CD31 in the luminal region decreased in HMB (mean quickscore: 1 and 5, respectively) compared with controls (3.2 and 7.4, respectively) (both P = 0.008), while expression of F8RA and CD34 increased in HMB (1.4 and 8, respectively) compared with controls (0 and 5.8, respectively) (both P = 0.008). There was also a distinct pattern of expression of the vascular structural ECM protein components osteopontin, laminin, fibronectin and collagen IV in the superficial myometrium, stratum functionalis and stratum basalis during the menstrual cycle, which was altered in HMB. In particular, compared with controls, osteopontin expression in HMB was higher in stratum functionalis in the LSP (7.2 and 11.2, respectively P = 0.008), while collagen IV expression was reduced in stratum basalis in the MSP (4.6 and 2.8, respectively P = 0.002) and in stratum functionalis in the ESP (7 and 3.2, respectively P = 0.008).  LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The protein expression of vascular EC markers and ECM components was assessed using a semi-quantitative approach in both straight and spiral arterioles. In our hospital, HMB is determined by subjective criteria and levels of blood loss were not assessed.  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Variation in the protein expression pattern between the four EC markers highlights the importance of choice of EC marker for investigation of endometrial vessels. Differences in expression of the different EC markers may reflect developmental stage dependent expression of EC markers in endometrial vessels, and their altered expression in HMB may reflect dysregulated vascular development. This hypothesis is supported by altered expression of ECM proteins within endometrial vessel walls, as well as our previous data showing a dysregulation in VSMC contractile protein expression in the endometrium of women with HMB. Taken together, these data support the suggestion that HMB symptoms are associated with weaker vascular structures, particularly in the LSP of the menstrual cycle, which may lead to increased and extended blood flow during menstruation.

For the first time, this article reports two signal modulation techniques (on–off keying—OOK, and concentration shift keying—CSK) which have been used to encode and transmit digital information using odors over distances of 1–4 m. Molecular transmission of digital data was experimentally investigated for the letter “r” with a binary value of 01110010 (ASCII) for a gas stream network channel (up to 4 m) using mass spectrometry (MS) as the main detection-decoding system. The generation and modulation of the chemical signals was achieved using an automated odor emitter (OE) which is based on the controlled evaporation of a chemical analyte and its diffusion into a carrier gas stream. The chemical signals produced propagate within a confined channel to reach the demodulator—MS. Experiments were undertaken for a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with different diffusion coefficient values in air at ambient conditions. Representative compounds investigated include acetone, cyclopentane, and n-hexane. For the first time, the binary code ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is combined with chemical signaling to generate a molecular representation of the English alphabet. Transmission experiments of fixed-width molecular signals corresponding to letters of the alphabet over varying distances are shown.

The ‘information age’ has witnessed widespread changes to personal intermediation across many business sectors (e.g. holiday sales and insurance brokerage), yet estate agents continue to be extensively involved. This paper asks whether the intermediation process has changed and why this is the case. Through a cultural economy investigation of the everyday practices of estate agents in New Zealand and England we identify how they have adapted, directed and responded to technological and social changes. In England, three service levels of agency arose with varying roles for technological information dissemination, the matching process and the formulization of prices. In New Zealand the hegemony of high quality service has resisted other mediation forms; retaining socially negotiated housing outcomes. Despite these differences, the unique facets of housing, its complex sale procedure and emotional transaction nature have hitherto enabled the adaptive capacity of estate agents to continue influencing housing market processes and rationalize their ongoing construction of housing transaction processes.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Advanced micro-reactor concepts.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3023446/","Peakman, Aiden; Hodgson, Zara; Merk, Bruno","July 2018","Nuclear power systems capable of outputting low powers (<100 MWth) are increasingly receiving interest internationally for deployment not only as electricity production systems, capable of operating off-grid, but also as systems able to provide industrial process heat. These ‘micro-reactor’ concepts must demonstrate economic competitiveness with other potential solutions capable of providing similar power outputs. With this in mind, reactor technologies that offer inherent advantages associated with improved power density and simplified operation, both of which are important attributes that determine economic competitiveness, are reviewed in the context of the fundamental safety functions provided by the IAEA. The reactor technology chosen based on the results of the review were: low vapour pressure coolants like molten salt or liquid metal; solid moderator material; and conventional solid UO2 fuel. Initial infinite lattice neutronic studies indicated a series of positive reactivity coefficients. A finite system was also modelled using a molten salt as the coolant. When modelling the finite system the coolant temperature reactivity coefficient became negative, the void coefficient strongly negative and moderator temperature coefficient negative to weakly positive. Given that a number of reactivity coefficients were negative to strongly negative in the finite system, the weakly positive moderator temperature coefficient is not thought to be prohibitive. Thus the design should exhibit acceptable safety performance. Whilst the importance of leakage in fast reactor cores is well known, a key outcome from this study is the strong influence of leakage on all safety related parameters for the thermal reactor designs considered here with solid moderator material. Thus it seems that safety studies for such small cores should be based on full core calculations instead of the traditional infinite lattice studies for fuel assemblies.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Corporate citizenship implies a set of exceptional powers and privileges that combine to produce homo supra, a paradigmatic “supra-sovereign” subject that is empowered to enjoy sovereign protections and rights far-exceeding those that any ordinary citizen could expect. The paper thus shows how the process of ascribing corporate citizenship has become a key mechanism through which unequal power relations (and attendant privileges of class, gender and race etc.) is guaranteed.  El artículo se ocupa del concepto de “ciudadano corporativo”. Utiliza la forma liberal de entender la ciudadanía, la cual, como punto de partida, implica responsabilidades y deberes hacia el Estado, por un lado, y los derechos garantizados por el Estado, por el otro, y aplica esa dualidad al ciudadano corporativo. Sin embargo, los derechos y deberes impuestos a las corporaciones no son estrictamente análogos a los derechos y deberes de los ciudadanos de carne y hueso. La ciudadanía corporativa implica un conjunto de poderes y privilegios excepcionales que se combinan para producir el homo supra, un “supersoberano” paradigmático que es empoderado con amparos y derechos soberanos que exceden con mucho aquéllos que un ciudadano normal podría esperar. Así, el artículo muestra cómo el proceso de asignar la ciudadanía corporativa se ha convertido en un mecanismo por el cual se garantizan relaciones desiguales de poder.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Determination of the effect of scan strategy on residual stress in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3024500/","Robinson, J; Ashton, I; Fox, P; Jones, E; Sutcliffe, C","August 2018","Any literature investigation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) manufacturing of metal parts would reveal that the development of internal stresses is a serious limitation in the application of this technology. Researchers have used a variety of different methods to quantify this stress and investigate scanning strategies aimed at reducing or distributing this stress more evenly in the part. The most common methods used to assess the levels of stress in parts are deflection based. These techniques provide a rapid method to give a quantitative comparison of scan strategies and parameters. Although studies have calculated the levels of stress relieved by the measured deflection, these studies often neglect the stresses that remain in the part after release. This study shows that these stresses can still be considerable. Non-destructive diffraction based methods can be used to calculate the profile of stress in a part but these are often prohibitively expensive or difficult to use on a large scale. This study presents a methodology which combines deflection based methods with either the hole drilling or contour methods. Results show that these experiments can be completed in a cost effective manner, with standard lab based equipment to generate a through thickness measurement of residual stress.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"On the Investment Value of Sell-Side Analyst Recommendation Revisions in the UK.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3024932/","Su, C; Zhang, Hanxiong; Bangassa, K; Lael Joseph, Nathan","August 2018","This study conducts a comprehensive investigation into the investment value of sell-side analyst recommendation revisions in the UK, using a unique dataset from 1995 to 2013. Our rolling window analysis shows that, on average, upgrades fail to generate any significantly positive abnormal returns in any period of time, even before transaction costs. In addition, although downgrades could generate significantly negative abnormal gross returns over some periods of time, these observed significant returns disappear after accounting for transaction costs. Overall, our bootstrapping simulations confirm sell-side analysts’ lack of skill in making valuable up/downward revisions to cover the size of transaction costs, irrespective of whether these revisions are made by high-ranking brokerage houses or not. However, an industry-based analysis shows that, within two high-tech industry sectors, i.e., Health Care and Technology sectors, sell-side analysts possess certain skill in making valuable downgrades over some periods of time and, in particular, such skill is sufficient to offset transaction costs.","AI","University of Liverpool"

No studies have analyzed the chemical constituents of teabacco made from nicotine lozenges, so as to document any potential related health hazards. Teabacco samples were made by a participant who reported creating teabacco while incarcerated in a smoke-free prison in Queensland, Australia, and the process was video-recorded for replication in a laboratory. A simple linear smoking system captured the teabacco smoke for analysis. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to analyze elemental composition and gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analyzed the captured smoke using the National Institute of Standards and Technology mass spectral library. Analyses determined that quantities of copper, aluminum, and lead concentrations, and levels of inhaled total particulate matter, were above recommended guidelines for safe ingestion. Analysis of teabacco smoke using GC-MS identified potentially toxic compounds catechol and nicotine. However, our findings show that smoking this form of teabacco is less harmful than smoking teabacco made from nicotine patches, or smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes. Considering the limited potential health harm of smoking teabacco made from lozenges, and that nicotine lozenges represent the only form of smoking cessation support for individuals entering smoke-free prisons, we caution against the removal of nicotine lozenges from Queensland's prisons, at least until further research directly establishes health harms associated with this form of teabacco.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Campylobacter, a zoonotic pathogen of global importance: Prevalence and risk factors in the fast-evolving chicken meat system of Nairobi, Kenya.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3026377/","Carron, Maud; Chang, Yu-Mei; Momanyi, Kelvin; Akoko, James; Kiiru, John; Bettridge, Judy; Chaloner, Gemma; Rushton, Jonathan; O’Brien, Sarah; Williams, Nicola; Fevre, EM; Häsler, Barbara","September 2018","Campylobacteriosis is a leading foodborne zoonosis worldwide, and is frequently associated with handling and consumption of poultry meat. Various studies indicate that Campylobacter causes a substantial human disease burden in low to middle-income countries, but data regarding the organism’s epidemiology in countries like Kenya are scarce. In sub-Saharan Africa, 3.8 million deaths of children under-5 years of age are reported annually. Of those, 25% are caused by diarrheal diseases, and Campylobacter is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria from diarrheic children. With the growth of urban conglomerates, such as Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, changes in diets, food production systems, and retailing dynamics, it is likely that exposure and susceptibility to this pathogen will change. Therefore, the importance of Campylobacter disease burden in Kenya may increase further. The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in Nairobi’s small-scale chicken farms and meat retailers, and 2) to identify potential risk factors associated with its presence in those sites. The prevalence data provides the first detailed baseline for this pathogen in the urban Kenyan context. The risk factors provide context-specific insights for disease managers. A cross-sectional study of broiler, indigenous chicken farms, and chicken meat retailers, was conducted in a peri-urban, low to middle-income area (Dagoretti), and a very-low income informal settlement (Kibera) of Nairobi. Chicken faeces were collected using one pair of boot socks per farm, and 3 raw chicken meat samples were purchased per retailer. Samples were cultured for viable Campylobacter spp. using mCCDA, followed by blood agar plates in aerobic/microaerobic conditions for prevalence calculations. A questionnaire-based survey on sanitary, sourcing and selling practices was conducted at each site for risk factor identification using logistic regression analyses. A total of 171 farm premises and 53 retailers were sampled and interviewed. The prevalence results for Campylobacter spp. were between 33 to 44% for broiler and indigenous chicken farms, 60% and 64% for retailers, in Dagoretti and Kibera, respectively. Univariable logistic regression showed an association between Campylobacter spp. presence and the easiness of cleaning the display material used by the retailer. Restricting access to the flock was also associated with the pathogen’s presence. Multivariable logistic regression identified the selling of defrosted meat as a retailer risk factor (OR: 4.69; 95% CI: 1.31–19.97), calling for more investigation of the reported repetitive freezing-thawing processes and cold chain improvement options. At the farm-level, having a pen floor of material not easy to clean was found to increase the risk (OR: 2.31; 95%CI: 1.06–5.37). The relatively high prevalence of Campylobacter spp. across different areas and value chain nodes indicates a clear human exposure risk. The open nature of both small-scale broiler and indigenous chicken production practices with low biosecurity, hygiene and informal transactions, likely plays a role in this. While gradual improvement of farm biosecurity is recommended, risk factors identified suggest that consumer education and enforcement of basic food safety principles at the retailer end of the food continuum represent key targets for risk reduction in informal settings","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Selection policy for a manufacturer’s online channel: do it oneself or cooperate with retailers.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3026388/","Wang, R; Li, B; Li, Z; Hou, P; Song, D","September 2018","This article compares two dual-channel models in a unified framework, using the traditional single-channel supply chain as a benchmark. Stackelberg games are applied to obtain the optimal equilibrium solutions to the two models. Our analysis indicates that although the manufacturer can always obtain more profit through his own dual channels than through a retailer’s dual channels, the retailer dual-channel model can capture the online market better than the manufacturer dual-channel model. Furthermore, we find that the manufacturer’s ability to control the channels will greatly influence the online entry of the retailer. We present the conditions under which the profits of the manufacturer (or the retailer) will be enhanced (or worsened) in these two dual-channel models. Finally, we extend the models in two directions. First, we generalize the models to a situation in which both the manufacturer and the retailer open e-channels simultaneously. Second, we extend the models to include cases where the online discount rate is treated as a decision variable. Analytical results from the extended models are then discussed and interpreted.","AI","University of Liverpool"

While several studies have compared the prognostic accuracy of qSOFA to the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in suspected sepsis, few have compared qSOFA and SIRS to the widely used National Early Warning Score (NEWS).  Methods This was a retrospective cohort study carried out in a UK tertiary centre. The study population comprised emergency admissions in whom sepsis was suspected and treated. The accuracy for predicting inhospital mortality and ICU admission was calculated and compared for qSOFA, SIRS and NEWS.  Results Among 1818 patients, 53 were admitted to ICU (3%) and 265 died in hospital (15%). For predicting inhospital mortality, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for NEWS (0.65, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.68) was similar to qSOFA (0.62, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.66) (test for difference, P=0.18) and superior to SIRS (P<0.001), which was not predictive. The sensitivity of NEWS≥5 (74%, 95% CI 68% to 79%) was similar to SIRS≥2 (80%, 95% CI 74% to 84%) and higher than qSOFA≥2 (37%, 95% CI 31% to 43%). The specificity of NEWS≥5 (43%, 95% CI 41% to 46%) was higher than SIRS≥2 (21%, 95% CI 19% to 23%) and lower than qSOFA≥2 (79%, 95% CI 77% to 81%). The negative predictive value was 88% (86%–90%) for qSOFA, 86% (82%–89%) for SIRS and 91% (88%–93%) for NEWS. Results were similar for the secondary outcome of ICU admission.  Conclusion NEWS has equivalent or superior value for most test characteristics relative to SIRS and qSOFA, calling into question the rationale of adopting qSOFA in institutions where NEWS is already in use.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Inclusion criteria were an abdominal ultrasound and cytological/histological diagnosis of malignant prostatic lymphoma. Ultrasonographic features were recorded based on the original ultrasonographic reports and consensus opinion of two readers on the available image sets retrospectively. Nine dogs met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 6.5 years. Seven dogs were intact and two neutered. Subjective prostatomegaly was noted in all patients however not reproducible by objective measurements. Altered shape with rounded/irregular margins was detected in 78% of the cases.

Morphological changes associated with salt marsh erosion facilitate the propagation of waves to the marsh edges, and increase the resuspension and export of sediments from the estuary. Results also highlight the impact of tidally-modulated changes in wave action upon sediment transport dynamics throughout a tidal cycle and from neap to spring tide. In particular, wave action at the landward margin of the estuary is limited by the shallow water depth, and tidally induced increments in water depth only cause a modest increase in wave shear stresses. At the seaward side of the domain, the impact of waves is limited by the deeper water, and tidally induced water level variations have a more significant control on wave shear stresses. The outcomes contribute new insights that are important for the sediment budget of macro-tidal estuaries facing climate change and have implications for the long-term morphological evolution of estuarine wetlands.","AI","University of Liverpool"

This is due to the high volume of images generated by the latter technique, which limit acquisition times and lengthen post-processing times.  In this experimental investigation, it is demonstrated that standard framerate CCD cameras yield results for the mean deflected shape of a reinforced aerospace panel subject to a random broadband excitation between 0 and 800 Hz that are not statistically different to those from high-speed cameras.  The images from both types of camera were processed using digital image correlation to generate out-of-plane displacement maps which were then decomposed using Chebyshev descriptors for ease of comparison and to determine the mean deflected shape.  The results indicate that, with appropriate sampling rates and durations, standard framerate CCD cameras can be used to study broadband random excitation behaviour of structures when mean behaviour needs to be characterised over long time scales compared to the excitation wavelengths.  This is contrary to accepted procedures, but offers comparable accuracy with substantially reduced computational resources compared to using high-speed cameras, as well as effectively unlimited data acquisition periods, which is useful in condition monitoring, for example.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with glycemic control among patients attending a tertiary clinic in Botswana as limited information to date.<h4>Methods</h4>Cross-sectional study in a tertiary clinic in Gaborone, Botswana. Patients were recruited between 21 July 2015 and 21 September 2015. The majority of the randomly recruited patients (368/380-96.8%) had documentation of glycemic control (HbA1c) within three months of study recruitment and were subsequently included in the analysis. Glycemic control was categorized as desirable, suboptimal and poor if HbA1c was <7%, 7-9% and >9%, respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS for descriptive statistics including both bivariate and multinomial logistic regression. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>The analyzed study population consisted of 258/368 (70.1%) females with a mean age (SD) of 56.7 ± 13.6 years. Means (SDs) for diabetes duration and glycated hemoglobin were 7.2 ± 7.1 years and 7.97 ± 2.02%, respectively. Of the 368 patients, 136 (36.95%) and 132/368 (35.86%) had desirable and suboptimal glycemic control, respectively. Older age, attending the clinic for more or equal to 3 years and not being on insulin were associated with both desirable and suboptimal glycemic control whereas duration of diabetes between 5 and 10 years was associated with poor glycemic control.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of patients had poor glycemic control. Older age and not being on insulin were associated with better glycemic control. The fact that patients on insulin had poor glycemic control calls for more research to determine the timing of insulin initiations and dosing schedule factors as these will help to improve overall glycemic control in Botswana and elsewhere.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Hydrogen and phenol compete for accessible Pt sites. The surface concentrations are compatible with the proposal that atomic hydrogen and chemisorbed phenol are the species reacting in the rate-determining step of hydrogenation in the presence and absence of an external cathodic potential. During electrocatalytic hydrogenation the external electric potential controls the concentration of species on the surface, but does not impose structural or electronic property changes of the Pt compared to Pt particles in presence of hydrogen gas.

Nonetheless, the poor mechanical strength of FDM parts restricts the use of this technology in functional parts of many applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) where lightweight, high strength, and stiffness are required. In the present paper, the fabrication process of low-density acrylonitrile butadiene styrenecarbon (ABS) with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich layers for UAV structure is proposed to improve the poor mechanical strength and elastic modulus of printed ABS. The composite sandwich structures retains FDM advantages for rapid making of complex geometries, while only requires simple post-processing steps to improve the mechanical properties. Artificial neural network (ANN) was used to investigate the influence of the core density and number of CFRP layers on the mechanical properties. The results showed an improvement of specific strength and elastic modulus with increasing the number of CFRP. The specific strength of the samples improved from 20 to 145 KN·m/kg while the Young's modulus increased from 0.63 to 10.1 GPa when laminating the samples with CFRP layers. On the other hand, the core density had no significant effect on both specific strength and elastic modulus. A case study was undertaken by applying the CFRP/ABS/CFRP sandwich structure using the proposed method to manufacture improved dual-tilting clamps of a quadcopter UAV.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The behaviour of aluminium matrix syntactic foams (AMSFs) with homogeneous and graded structures have been studied under quasi-static compression and impact. Particle size of ceramic microspheres and impact velocity had significant effects on the static and impact responses. Smaller microspheres led to higher strength but lower toughness. The compressive yield stress, plateau stress and specific energy absorption of the graded AMSF specimens were approximately the averages of the constituent layers, following the rule of mixture, although the order of the layers had some influence on the compressive behaviour. The syntactic foams were brittle under impact, no matter whether they were brittle or ductile in quasi-static compression. They had higher peak stresses and absorbed more energy in impact than in quasi-static compression.

Porous metals are highly efficient media for active cooling and thermal management. However, the working fluid requires high pumping power to flow through the porous metals. This paper investigated the effect of structural characteristics (porosity, pore size and Cu particle size) on the heat transfer performance of porous Cu manufactured by Lost Carbonate Sintering (LCS). The heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop of porous Cu samples with porosity from 0.48 to 0.78, pore size from 250-1500 μm and Cu particle size from 75 to 841 μm were measured under the onedimensional forced convection condition using water. For all the samples with different pore sizes and Cu particle sizes, the optimum heat transfer coefficient was observed at a porosity between 0.6 and 0.7 and the pressure drop decreased with increasing porosity. The effect of pore size on heat transfer coefficient was not pronounced while pressure drop decreased with decreasing pore size. Samples with large Cu particles (841 μm) had higher optimum heat transfer coefficients and lower pressure drops. The coefficient of performance (CoP), which can be used to describe the overall heat transfer performance, increased with increasing porosity, decreasing pore size and increasing Cu particle size.","AI","University of Liverpool"

In this work, we systematically assess the effects of different gases at various pressures on the quality and resolution of images obtained at room temperature in the annular dark field STEM imaging mode by using a differentially pumped (DP) gas cell. This imaging mode is largely free from inelastic scattering effects induced by the presence of gases and retains good imaging properties over a wide range of gas mass/pressures.

"Bridging Customer Knowledge to Innovative Product Development: A data mining approach.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3031001/","Zhan, Y; Tan, Kim Hua; Huo, Baofeng","January 2019","In the big data era, firms are inundated with customer data, which are valuable in improving services, developing new products, and identifying new markets. However, it is not clear how companies apply data-driven methods to facilitate customer knowledge management when developing innovative new products. Studies have investigated the specific benefits of applying data-driven methods in customer knowledge management, but failed to systematically investigate the specific mechanics of how firms realised these benefits. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach to link customer knowledge with innovative product development in a data-driven environment. To mine customer needs, this study adopts the Apriori algorithm and C5.0 in addition to the association rule and decision tree methodologies for data mining. It provides a systematic and effective method for managers to extract knowledge ‘from’ and ‘about’ customers to identify their preferences, enabling firms to develop the right products and gain competitive advantages. The findings indicate that the knowledge-based approach is effective, and the knowledge extracted is shown as a set of rules that can be used to identify useful patterns for both innovative product development and marketing strategies.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Our findings elucidate  how  the  IT  gender  structure  shapes  women’s  careers  in  this  field  of  work.  They reveal how women use their agency to assert notions of femininity into technical careers, disentangle narratives around whether women have unique and different (but less technically focused) strengths in IT and interface with ‘geek’ and ‘nerd’ identities to  achieve  successful  IT  careers.  In  doing  so,  they  provide  insight  into  how  technical  women  continue  careers  within  a  structure  that  externalises  them  through  gender  norms.

Such expansion may threaten human health, and food security via effects on animal and crop health. Here we quantify the potential impact of climate change on a vector-borne disease of livestock, bluetongue, which has emerged in northern Europe in response to climate change2,3,4, affecting tens of thousands of farms at huge financial cost and causing the deaths of millions of animals5. We derive future disease risk trends for northern Europe, and use a detailed spatial transmission model6 to simulate outbreaks in England and Wales under future climatic conditions, using an ensemble of five downscaled general circulation models7. By 2100, bluetongue risk extends further north, the transmission season lengthens by up to three months and outbreaks are larger on average. A 1 in 20-year outbreak at present-day temperatures becomes typical by the 2070s under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario. However, animal movement restrictions are sufficient to prevent truly devastating outbreaks. Disease transmission uncertainty dominates over climate uncertainty, even at the longest prediction timescales. Our results suggest that efficient detection and control measures to limit the spread of vector-borne diseases will be increasingly vital in future, warmer climates.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Existing scholarship offers a rich seam of doctrinal, normative and theoretical critique of the evolving international investment law regime. However, with the exception of some recent studies, there have been relatively limited efforts to analyse international investment law empirically and in particular from a developing country perspective.  This paper aims to contribute by filling the gap and offering some insights into the currently underexplored issue of how international investment law influences host state behaviour. In particular, the aim of this study is to test existing claims about the transformative impact of international investment law on national governance in developing states. The analysis is carried out through a small-scale empirical case-study which focuses on how international investment law is perceived by government officials in developing countries whilst also elucidating how governments responded to investment treaty disciplines after experiencing the regime’s bite.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Preoperative imaging lacks reliability; therefore, holding an appropriate index of suspicion, based on the epidemiology of and risk factors for LMPRT, may reduce the rate of missed diagnoses. PURPOSE::The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for lateral meniscus root lesions in a large series of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN::Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS::All patients who underwent primary or revision ACL reconstruction by a single surgeon between January 2011 and April 2018 were considered for study eligibility. From this overall population, all patients who underwent repair of an LMPRT were identified. The epidemiology of LMPRT was defined by the incidence within the study population, stratified by key demographic parameters. Potentially important risk factors for the presence of LMPRT were evaluated in multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS::A total of 3956 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction were included in the study. An LMPRT was identified and repaired in 262 patients (6.6%). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that significant risk factors for LMPRT included a contact sports injury mechanism (7.8% incidence with contact sport mechanism vs 4.5% with noncontact mechanism; odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.266-2.285; P < .001) and the presence of a medial meniscal tear (7.9% incidence with medial meniscal tear vs 5.8% without; odds ratio, 1.532; 95% CI, 1.185-1.979; P < .001). Although the incidence of LMPRT in male patients (7.3%) was higher than in females (4.8%), this was not significant in multivariate analysis ( P = .270). Patient age, revision ACL reconstruction, and a preoperative side-to-side laxity difference ≥6 mm were not significant risk factors for LMPRT. CONCLUSION::The incidence of LMPRT was 6.6% in a large series of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. Participation in contact sports and the presence of a concomitant medial meniscal tear were demonstrated to be important independent risk factors. Their presence should raise the index of suspicion for this injury pattern.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"The world of work and the crisis of capitalism: Marx and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3032894/","Hughes, Carl; Southern, Alan","February 2019","<jats:p> Marx’s work on machines showed an initial clarity on where he believed technology sits in the means of production. The machine, its differentia specifica, while it consumes other forms of raw material just as the labourer consumes food, does not appear as the means of labour in the same way as that of the individual worker. How this fits in with contemporary debate around the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its re-shaping of the world of work is the focus in this article. Our examination of this is in the broader context of the crisis of capitalism, the tendency towards objectified labour and the view that automation, the ‘Uberization’ of the economy, is likely to sharpen the contradictions between capital and labour. Whether we are entering a time of post capitalism, or a post-work period, warnings of job loss associated with the convergence of robotisation, big data digitisation, bio-tech and artificial intelligence indicate that the tension and complexity of decreased labour inputs will lead to a more acute world of work. Here, we draw on the work of Marx to help stimulate ideas for investigating and analysing what the Fourth Industrial Revolution means for labour and how the neutrality of the technologies remains to be socially shaped. </jats:p>","AI","University of Liverpool"

National forest inventories are often used to indicate recent carbon dynamics, but the data from unmanaged forests are often incomplete. Here we calculate changing biomass carbon stocks for a mixed, unmanaged British woodland with two different management histories: (1) older growth stands untouched since 1902 and (2) younger growth stands clear felled in 1943 but have developed naturally since. Transects in the older growth have been monitored since 1945 and the younger growth since 1977. Separate estimates of tree carbon (C), soil C and dead wood C were obtained to verify how C is apportioned in these stands. Tree biomass C stocks had approximately doubled in the older growth stands since 1945 and 60% of C was stored in tree biomass, 38% was stored in soil and 2% stored in coarse woody debris. This study suggests that natural older growth stands are storing more C than typical managed forests, with tree biomass the most important compartment for C stores. If management is to be shifted from biomass production to increased C stores, due consideration should be given to the role of unmanaged, older growth forests.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"The Star in VR.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3033405/","Thomas, SK","February 2019","Since the mid-2010s there has been sustained investment in Virtual Reality (VR) media and technology, aiming to target a mass consumer market; however the industry is far from stable and challenges of adoption for the mass consumer entertainment market remain. This article examines how film stardom is being employed as a means of facilitating VR, aiding negotiation and engagement with new technologies, texts, audiences and markets. It considers the potential cultural, textual and economic significance of the film star to this emergent media technology by identifying three independent-but-interrelated ways that stardom operates in VR. Firstly, as a discursive site where film stardom connotes quality and economic viability in the promotion of the VR platform. Secondly, as a textual structure that embodies the immersive nature of the VR text, reflecting VR’s own dichotomies of perception and presence. Thirdly, as a transmedia system, connecting global markets and enabling capital investment in both film and VR forms. Throughout all arenas, film star significance is located in continuing perceptions of their ability to act as bridging forces, and as images of quality and depth. This further reflects the parallels between stardom and VR, whereby both rely on the promise of immersive, expansive, connected experiences.","AI","University of Liverpool"

METHODS:Epithelium and endothelium of research-grade human donor corneas (n = 12) were scraped off, leaving a bare stroma with attached sclera. The tissues were placed in a large Petri dish prefilled with silica gel in the periphery and stored at room temperature for 14 days. At the end of preservation, the tissues were rehydrated by being submerged in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 minutes. Transparency (using a custom-built device) and thickness (using optical coherence tomography) measurements were recorded before dehydration, after dehydration, and after rehydration of the tissues. Periodic acid-Schiff and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) staining before dehydration and after rehydration were performed to determine the presence of keratocytes and expression of α-SMA. Tensile stress-strain before dehydration and after rehydration was performed to evaluate the biomechanical properties. RESULTS:No difference in corneal transparency before dehydration (69.57 ± 6.41%) and after rehydration (67.37 ± 2.82%), P = 0.36, was observed. The corneas were more compact after dehydration. A significant change in thickness between before dehydration (625.8 ± 75.58 μm) and after rehydration (563.6 ± 15.77 μm) stage, P = 0.03, was noticed. The thickness was reduced to 147.6 ± 3.71 μm when dehydrated. Periodic acid-Schiff staining showed presence of stromal keratocytes and α-SMA protein expressed in control, dehydrated, and rehydrated corneas. There was no significant difference in the stiffness between control (27.86 ± 11.65 MPa) and rehydrated corneas (31.46 ± 11.41 MPa). CONCLUSIONS:Human donor corneal stroma can be biobanked for up to 2 weeks in a dehydrated condition without losing their molecular or biomechanical properties after rehydration.","AI","University of Liverpool"

CAP is created by applying a high voltage to a gas stream, resulting in microbial inactivation according to different mechanisms. This paper thoroughly assesses the influence of CAP on the storage life of food model systems inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium. (Food) model systems, with varying intrinsic factors (pH, salt concentration, and food (micro)structure), are treated for 5 min using a dielectric barrier discharge reactor generating a helium‑oxygen plasma. Following treatment, the impact of extrinsic factors is evaluated by storage at 8 °C or 20 °C. During storage, cell densities are determined. Data are fitted with predictive (growth or inactivation) models. As additional experiments indicate that the CAP treatment itself has a limited or even negligible effect on the properties of the model system (pH, aw, (micro)structure), the microbial behavior of CAP treated samples during storage can be attributed to the treatment. CAP treatment can result in microbial reductions up to 2.7 log10 and prolongs storage, however its rate of success is dependent on both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. An important factor is the storage temperature, as recovery of CAP treated cells proves more difficult when stored at 8 °C. At 20 °C, cell growth is merely slowed down. Additionally, at pH 5.5, 6% (w/v) NaCl, osmotic stress is induced on the microorganisms, which results in low cell recovery or further inactivation. The influence of the food (model) structure on the storage behavior is insignificant. Industrial relevance: Although being a very promising technology, most studies regarding the use of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) for food decontamination focus on the inactivation of a target microorganism, in relation to a specific food product. Fundamental knowledge on this non-thermal technology, including its impact on the storage life, is lacking. This study investigates the effect of CAP on the microbial behavior during storage. By performing tests on model systems, for a variation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, this work renders information on the suitability of this novel technology regarding treatment of a broad spectrum of food products. Moreover, this study demonstrates the limited impact of CAP on the food (model) properties, enhancing the suitability of the technology to be implemented in the food industry.","AI","University of Liverpool"

By means of abductive research, we explore the distinct elements of entrepreneurial places in rural contexts and derive an integrated meso-level framework, comprising place-sensitive determinations and dimensions, to observe and further analyse the enabling conditions of such places. The findings obtained and the framework developed will be of great use for the evaluation and decision-making, regarding entrepreneurship in rural communities.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The Suzhou National High-tech District tram was investigated as a case study. Two key findings are highlighted. Firstly, the new tramway was routed along the “path of least resistance” – avoiding dense urban areas, to reduce conflict with cars. Secondly, regarding urban transport integration, four perspectives were evaluated, namely planning and design, service operation, transport governance and user experience. Findings show insufficient integration in the following aspects, namely tram and bus routes and services, fares on multi-modal journeys, tram station distribution, service intervals, and luggage auxiliary support. The paper argues there is a need for a critical review of the role of tram and for context-based innovative policy reform and governance that could possibly facilitate a successful introduction and integration of tram into a city.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"Barriers and facilitators of maintained smoking abstinence following release from smoke-free prisons: A qualitative enquiry.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3036268/","Puljevic, Cheneal; Coomber, Ross; de Andrade, Dominique; Kinner, Stuart A","April 2019","<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of smoking among people entering prisons is high. Despite increasing adoption of prison smoke-free policies, relapse to smoking after release from prison is nearly universal, and policy to effectively mitigate this is largely absent. Informed by a risk environment framework, we aimed to identify key barriers and facilitators to maintaining smoking abstinence among former smokers released from smoke-free prisons.<h4>Method</h4>Twenty-one people released from smoke-free prisons in Queensland, Australia, were followed up from a larger survey of 114 former prisoners. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the perceived barriers and facilitators of maintained smoking abstinence.<h4>Findings</h4>Identified barriers to continued abstinence included pre-release intention to resume smoking; normalisation of smoking in home or social environments, resumption of smoking as a symbolic act of freedom and resistance from and to a restrictive environment; a perception that smoking provides stress relief to their difficult lives, and the use of tobacco/smoking to cope with cravings experienced on release for illicit substances. A number of interviewees were unable to provide clear reflective reasons for relapse. For those who did manage to remain abstinent for a period of time, identified facilitators included an awareness of the health and financial benefits of smoking abstinence, the use of intrinsic motivation, distraction from nicotine cravings using alternative activities, and social support from family and peers.<h4>Discussion</h4>Interventions promoting continued smoking abstinence among people exiting smoke-free prisons should focus on targeting the perceived individual- and environmental-level barriers to maintained smoking abstinence while simultaneously promoting perceived facilitators, so as to reduce smoking-related health and economic disparities in this marginalised population.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Cardiovascular Risk and Risk Factor Management in Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based Cohort Study Assessing Sex Disparities.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3038814/","Wright, Alison K; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Emsley, Richard; Buchan, Iain Edward; Mamas, Mamas A; Sattar, Naveed; Ashcroft, Darren M; Rutter, Martin K","April 2024","BACKGROUND:With recent changes in UK clinical practice for diabetes care, contemporary estimates of sex disparities in cardiovascular risk and risk factor management are needed. METHODS:In this retrospective cohort study, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to hospital and death records for people in England, we identified 79,985 patients with incident T2DM between 2006-2013 matched to 386,547 patients without diabetes. Sex-stratified Cox models were used to assess cardiovascular risk. RESULTS:Compared to women without T2DM, women with T2DM had a higher cardiovascular event risk (adjusted HR 1.20 [95% CI 1.12-1.28]) with similar corresponding data in men (HR 1.12 [1.06-1.19]) leading to a non-significant higher relative risk in women (risk ratio 1.07 [0.98-1.17]). However, some important sex differences in the management of risk factors were observed. Compared to men with T2DM, women with T2DM were more likely to be obese, hypertensive and have hypercholesterolaemia but were less likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering medication and ACE inhibitors, especially if they had CVD. CONCLUSIONS:Compared to men developing T2DM, women with T2DM do not have a significantly higher relative increase in cardiovascular risk, but ongoing sex disparities in prescribing should prompt heightened efforts to improve the standard and equity of diabetes care in women and men.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"The effect of supply chain finance initiatives on the market value of service providers.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3039080/","Lam, Hugo KS; Zhan, Y; Zhang, Minhao; Wang, Yichuan; Lyons, Andrew","May 2019","Supply chain finance (SCF) aims to optimally align financial resource flows with material and information flows within supply chains. Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the potential of SCF resulting in improving cash-flow management and obtaining loan opportunities for suppliers and buyers, little is known about whether SCF initiatives can result in positive market value for service providers. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of SCF initiatives with the distinctive characteristics (that is, firm characteristic, collaborative mechanism, and service type) on service providers’ market value. We adopted the event study methodology to analyse 177 SCF initiatives announced between 2008 and 2018 (Quarter 1) in the Chinese market. The event study results showed that the average abnormal returns over a three-day event window around the SCF announcements are 0.793%, representing an average increase of CNY 1.66 billion in market value for the service providers. Moreover, we found that such increase in market value is significantly higher when the SCF initiatives are announced by non-bank investors (e.g., fintechs), when the service providers collaborate to provide SCF services, and when the service providers upgrade existing SCF services rather than introduce new SCF services. As the market value of an SCF announcement is evaluated with several essential characteristics examined to understand which types of service providers and initiatives are considered to be the most valuable service offerings, this study offers important insights to SCF practitioners and supply chain stakeholders.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Body condition impacts blood and muscle oxygen storage capacity of free-living beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas).","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3041272/","Choy, Emily S; Campbell, Kevin L; Berenbrink, Michael; Roth, James D; Loseto, Lisa L","May 2019","Arctic marine ecosystems are currently undergoing rapid environmental changes. Over the past 20 years, individual growth rates of beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) have declined, which may be a response to climate change; however, the scarcity of physiological data makes it difficult to gauge the adaptive capacity and resilience of the species. We explored relationships between body condition and physiological parameters pertaining to oxygen (O2) storage capacity in 77 beluga whales in the eastern Beaufort Sea. Muscle myoglobin concentrations averaged 77.9 mg g−1, one of the highest values reported among mammals. Importantly, blood haematocrit, haemoglobin and muscle myoglobin concentrations correlated positively to indices of body condition, including maximum half-girth to length ratios. Thus, a whale with the lowest body condition index would have ∼27% lower blood (26.0 versus 35.7 ml kg−1) and 12% lower muscle (15.6 versus 17.7 ml kg−1) O2 stores than a whale of equivalent mass with the highest body condition index; with the conservative assumption that underwater O2 consumption rates are unaffected by body condition, this equates to a >3 min difference in maximal aerobic dive time between the two extremes (14.3 versus 17.4 min). Consequently, environmental changes that negatively impact body condition may hinder the ability of whales to reach preferred prey sources, evade predators and escape ice entrapments. The relationship between body condition and O2 storage capacity may represent a vicious cycle, in which environmental changes resulting in decreased body condition impair foraging, leading to further reductions in condition through diminished prey acquisition and/or increased foraging efforts.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Long-term (10-year) dental implant survival: A systematic review and sensitivity meta-analysis.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3041376/","Howe, Mark-Steven; Keys, William; Richards, Derek","May 2019","<h4>Objectives</h4>To identify and appraise the most recent studies reporting dental implant survival in adults (≥18 years) using contemporary implant systems (solid screw, roughened surface) for a period of 10 years; and explore new predictors of implant survival.<h4>Source</h4>MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials were searched from 1997 to January 2018 to focus on contemporary implant systems.<h4>Study selection</h4>Only prospective observational studies with at least 10 participants and 35 implants were included. The unit of study was the 'absolute survival' rate of dental implants after 10 years in the oral cavity. Study quality was assessed utilising a modified Hoy risk of bias tool for prevalence studies. A sensitivity meta-analysis was undertaken utilising a plausibly imputed model for missing data.<h4>Data</h4>18 studies met the inclusion criteria. The summary estimate for 10-year survival at the implant level was 96.4% (95% CI 95.2%-97.5%) and the prediction interval was 91.5%-99.4%. The sensitivity meta-analysis summary estimate of survival was 93.2% (95% CI 90.1% to 95.8%)p = 0.041 with a prediction interval of 76.6%-100%. Older age (≥ 65 years) was a significant predictor at 91.5%, p = 0.038 in the sensitivity meta-analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A traditional analysis produced similar 10-year survival estimates to previous systematic reviews. A more realistic sensitivity meta-analysis accounting for loss to follow-up data and the calculation of prediction intervals demonstrated a possible doubling of the risk of implant loss in the older age groups.<h4>Clinical significance</h4>Improved analysis provides the clinician with better estimation of the real-world risk of implant failures so helping the clinician communicate the potential risk to patients.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Untangling the ‘Dark Web’: an emerging technological challenge for the criminal law.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3041661/","Shillito, Matthew Robert","May 2019","The Dark Web, and the technology which underpins it, is fundamentally changing how crime is conducted. It is an enabler of cross-border, truly international crime where each of the major actors, evidence, and the proceeds of crime can all be in different jurisdictions. The technologies utilised mask the identity of individuals and the nature of the crimes committed. It is these complexities, and law’s inability to deal with them, which this paper will focus on. It critically analyses six intersecting and overlapping themes in order to highlight the technological challenges posed by the Dark Web to the criminal law. The paper argues that the current approaches, regulatory structures, legislation and investigative methods are all unfit for purpose. There is little to suggest the law is any closer to restricting Dark Web crime, particularly given a substantial amount of the challenges posed are unsolved traditional issues, in a new form.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"The effectiveness of adding horizontal greening and vertical greening to courtyard areas of existing buildings in the hot summer cold winter region of China: A case study for Ningbo.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3042195/","Li, Zhilei; Chow, David HC; Yao, Jian; Zheng, Xiao; Zhao, Wei","June 2019","The “Hot Summer Cold Winter” climate region of China is one of the most challenging regions for providing occupant comfort in buildings, with high demands for heating as well as cooling, together with high humidity levels. Although the performance of buildings has improved with the implementation of the new Chinese National Building Standards for the Zhejiang Province, it is believed that adding passive strategies could help to alleviate the problem even further. This paper aims to investigate the effects of adding horizontal greening (green roof) and vertical greening in the courtyard area to existing public buildings in the “Hot Summer Cold Winter” climate region of China. Using computer simulation and measurements from a monitored case in the city of Ningbo, the effects of green retrofitting on human comfort and energy consumption are analysed. Simulation results suggest that with partial horizontal and vertical greening, the cooling load could be reduced by 8.8% and heating load by 1.85%. Comparisons between actual energy use before and after greening on the case building showed significant reductions in both winter and summer, confirming the positive effects of vertical and horizontal greening of public buildings in this region.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Do closed-end fund investors herd?","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3042987/","Cui, Yueting; Gebka, Bartosz; Kallinterakis, V","June 2019","We provide the first investigation of herding among closed-end fund investors, drawing on the US closed-end fund market for the 1992–2016 period. Results suggest closed-end fund investors herd significantly, with their herding being mainly driven by non-fundamentals. Closed-end fund herding rises in economic/market uncertainty, with its significance being mainly concentrated in the post-2007 period. Herding among closed-end funds is strongly motivated by discounts, is more pronounced than that among their net asset values and tends to grow inversely with fund-size. The fact that closed-end fund herding is noise-driven and linked to their discounts raises the possibility that it is related to the noise trader risk attributed to closed-end funds by investor sentiment theory.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Eight of the 19 variants that were genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) in the discovery GWAS were not genome-wide significant in the combined analysis, consistent with small effect sizes and limited power but also with genetic heterogeneity. In the combined analysis, 30 loci were genome-wide significant, including 20 newly identified loci. The significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels, neurotransmitter transporters and synaptic components. Pathway analysis revealed nine significantly enriched gene sets, including regulation of insulin secretion and endocannabinoid signaling. Bipolar I disorder is strongly genetically correlated with schizophrenia, driven by psychosis, whereas bipolar II disorder is more strongly correlated with major depressive disorder. These findings address key clinical questions and provide potential biological mechanisms for bipolar disorder.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Here we show that SARI<sup>-/-</sup> mice were highly susceptible to colitis, which was associated with enhanced macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokine production. Bone marrow reconstitution experiments demonstrated that disease susceptibility was not dependent on the deficiency of SARI in the immune compartment but on the protective role of SARI in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Furthermore, SARI deficiency enhanced Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) production and knockout of CCR2 blocks the promoting role of SARI deficiency on colitis. Mechanistically, SARI directly targets and promotes signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) degradation in IECs, followed by persistent inactivation of the STAT1/CCL2 transcription complex. In summary, SARI attenuated colitis in mice by impairing colitis-dependent STAT1/CCL2 transcriptional activation in IECs and macrophages recruitment in colon tissue.","AI","University of Liverpool"

"A multi-column plate adapter provides an economical and versatile high-throughput protein purification system.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3048195/","Dominguez, Matthew J; Lantz, Benjamin J; Rhode, Rebecca J; Sharp, Zoey L; Finney, Krysten C; Martinez, Valeria Jaramillo; Stollar, Elliott J","April 2024","Protein purification is essential in the study of protein structure and function, and the development of novel therapeutics. Many studies require purifying multiple proteins at once, increasing the demand for improved purification methods. We hypothesized that multiple chromatography columns could be interfaced with a multi-well collection plate for rapid and convenient protein purification without the need of expensive instrumentation. As such, we developed a multi-column plate adapter (MCPA), which provides an economical yet versatile and time efficient, high-throughput protein purification system. The MCPA system simultaneously purified milligrams of different proteins under gravity or under vacuum for faster purification. The MCPA handles up to twenty-four 12 mL columns and multiple MCPA's in sequence allow milligram-scale purification of 96 different samples with relative ease. We also used the MCPA system for large scale affinity purification of four proteins, providing sufficient yields and purity for protein crystallization and biophysical characterization. The MCPA system is ideal for optimizing resin type and volume or any other purification parameter by customizing individual columns during the same purification. The high-throughput and versatile nature of this system should prove to be useful in obtaining adequate amounts of protein for subsequent analyses in any laboratory setting.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Adverse outcome pathway (AOP) models provide “bottom‐up” mechanisms to predict specific toxicological effects that could affect an individual's ability to grow, reproduce, and/or survive from a molecular initiating event. Dynamic energy budget (DEB) models offer a “top‐down” approach that reverse engineers stressor effects on growth, reproduction, and/or survival into modular characterizations related to the acquisition and processing of energy resources. Thus, AOP models quantify linkages between measurable molecular, cellular, or organ‐level events, but they do not offer an explicit route to integratively characterize stressor effects at higher levels of organization. While DEB models provide the inherent basis to link effects on individuals to those at the population and ecosystem levels, their use of abstract variables obscures mechanistic connections to suborganismal biology. To take advantage of both approaches, we developed a conceptual model to link DEB and AOP models by interpreting AOP key events as measures of damage‐inducing processes affecting DEB variables and rates. We report on the type and structure of data that are generated for AOP models that may also be useful for DEB models. We also report on case studies under development that merge information collected for AOPs with DEB models and highlight some of the challenges. Finally, we discuss how the linkage of these 2 approaches can improve ecological risk assessment, with possibilities for progress in predicting population responses to toxicant exposures within realistic environments.

"High Electrochemical Seawater Desalination Performance Enabled by an Iodide Redox Electrolyte Paired with a Sodium Superionic Conductor.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3049552/","Lee, Juhan; Srimuk, Pattarachai; Zornitta, Rafael L; Aslan, Mesut; Mehdi, B Layla; Presser, Volker","July 2019","In recent years, a wealth of new desalination technologies based on reversible electrochemical redox reactions has emerged. Among them, the use of redox-active electrolytes is highly attractive due to the high production rate and energy efficiency. Yet, these technologies suffer from the imperfect permselectivity of polymer membranes. Our present work demonstrates the promising desalination performance of a sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) for selective removal of sodium against iodide in a half-cell configuration consisting of an activated carbon electrode in aqueous 600 mM NaI solution. For feedwater with aqueous 600 mM NaCl, the desalination cell exhibited a stable performance over a month with more than 400 operation cycles with the aid of high sodium permselectivity of the NASICON membrane against iodide (99.9-100%). The cell exhibited a maximum sodium removal capacity of 69 ± 4 mg/g (equivalent to the NaCl salt uptake capacity of 87 ± 4 mg/g) with a charge efficiency of 81 ± 3%.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Prospective, open-label Phase 1 study. The safety and acceptability of three repeated doses of RPV LA were monitored. Blood, tissue (rectal, cervical, and vaginal), and biological fluids (vaginal and endocervical) were collected at baseline and at 1- to 2-month intervals throughout the study for PK and PD assessment. Eight women and four men received three intramuscular doses of 1,200 mg of RPV LA given 8 weeks apart. There were a total of 195 adverse events (AEs) reported, of which 138 (70.8%) were Grade 1 and 55 (28.2%) were Grade 2. The most common AE was injection site pain. Geometric mean (90% confidence interval) plasma RPV concentrations at 56 days after the first and third doses were 39 (33-45) ng/mL (female)/29 (17-40) ng/mL (male) and 59 (45-62) ng/mL (female)/40 (30-51) ng/mL (male), respectively. Exposure to RPV LA was associated with significant inhibition of HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub> viral replication in the <i>ex vivo</i> rectal explant model (<i>p</i> < .0001) that persisted for up to 4 months after the third dose of RPV LA. In contrast, no viral suppression was seen in cervicovaginal tissue. Multiple dose administration of RPV LA was safe and well tolerated, and was associated with prolonged suppression of viral replication in rectal explant tissue.","AI","University of Liverpool"

Responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been reported but data on expression of target receptor tyrosine kinases (rTKs) is limited. This study characterizes the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α and PDGFR-β in canine intranasal carcinomas. Histological samples from 187 dogs were retrieved. Immunohistochemistry was performed using commercially available antibodies. Expression of rTKs was classified into weak, moderate or intense and additionally recorded as cytoplasmic, membranous, cytoplasmic-membranous, nuclear or stromal. VEGFR was expressed in 158 dogs with predominantly moderate expression (36.9%) and a cytoplasmic-membranous expression pattern (70.9%). PDGFR-α was detected in 133 with predominantly weak expression (57.9%) and cytoplasmic pattern (87.9%). PDGFR-β was identified in 74 patients with a predominantly moderate expression (17.6%) and cytoplasmic expression pattern (63.5%). Co-expression of rTKs was common. These results confirm expression of VEGFR, PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β in canine intranasal carcinomas and support the utility of TKIs.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Dry weather fears of Britain’s early ‘industrial’ canal network.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3051339/","Harvey-Fishenden, A; Macdonald, N; Bowen, JP","August 2019","© 2019, The Author(s). The first large-scale water supply in Britain was not for potable domestic supplies, but for the canal network, the arteries of the industrial revolution. This paper examines how episodes of dry weather in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, reconstructed from early instrumental sources, impacted the developing canal network. Analysis reveals how a frequent lack of preparedness for even relatively minor drought events resulted in conflict between water users, with potentially serious socio-economic consequences. The economic pressure of compensating other users for loss or reduction of their water supply resulted in canal companies investing in technologies and management techniques that continue to be used today as drought mitigation strategies, such as the building of large-capacity reservoirs and groundwater abstraction. This period represents a key technological milestone in the development of the modern water supply systems, contextualising current challenges faced by the water industry in responding to drought events. Although the failure of the British canal system no longer has serious economic impacts, themes emerge from this research which are as relevant for water supplies today as they were in the eighteenth century, such as issues around water rights and the value of preparing for potential future extreme weather scenarios. A newly reconstructed composite precipitation series for Chatsworth House is presented (1760–present). Through comparing weather records within the archives of canal companies and their competitors for water supplies, historical insight can be gained into the possible far-reaching societal impacts of drought.","AI","University of Liverpool"
"Product variety, customisation and business process performance: A mixed-methods approach to understanding their relationships.","http://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3052035/","Lyons, AC; Um, Juneho; Sharifi, Hossein","August 2019","This research presents findings from a sequential, mixed qualitative and quantitative method comprising five case studies and a survey of 162 different manufacturing sites where we examined how increases in product variety influence the performance of a wide range of business processes within and across the value chain of engineering, manufacturing, procurement, logistics and sales. We also identified the advantages associated with an increase in product variety and investigated the relationships between business process performance and degree of customisation. Drawing on value chain and resource-based logic, a product variety increase was found to have a differential impact on business processes and was partly contingent on the levels of customisation offered. The results provide both a better understanding of the implications and relative costs associated with product variety increases on key business processes and activities and highlight key areas of business process capability development in order to mitigate the effects of variety increases. The study also provides an example for researchers on the process and advantages of using mixed methods. The results are valuable for manufacturers considering extending their product range in order to provide more choice for customers.","AI","University of Liverpool"

The device is based on the dry ion localization and locomotion (DRILL) mass spectrometry interface of Fedorov and co-workers. By adding electrospray emitters, heating the desolvation gas, and operating at high gas flow rates, it is possible to obtain stable ion currents up to -15 nA that are ideal for deposition. Coupled with ambient ion optics, this interface enables desolvated ions to be delivered to surfaces while excluding solvent and counterions. Electron microscopy of surfaces prepared using the device reveal discrete POM and no aggregation that degrades electrode performance. Characterization of POM-coated CNT electrodes in a supercapacitor showed an energy storage capacity similar to that achieved with SL in vacuum. For solutions that produce primarily a single ion by electrospray ionization, benchtop SL offers a simpler and less costly approach for surface modification with applications in catalysis, energy storage, and beyond.","AI","University of Liverpool"
