P.; Malamateniou, C.","31 Aug 2023","Artificial intelligence (AI) has transitioned from the lab to the bedside, and it is increasingly being used in healthcare. Radiology and Radiography are on the frontline of AI implementation, because of the use of big data for medical imaging and diagnosis for different patient groups. Safe and effective AI implementation requires that responsible and ethical practices are upheld by all key stakeholders, that there is harmonious collaboration between different professional groups, and customised educational provisions for all involved. This paper outlines key principles of ethical and responsible AI, highlights recent educational initiatives for clinical practitioners and discusses the synergies between all medical imaging professionals as they prepare for the digital future in Europe. Responsible and ethical AI is vital to enhance a culture of safety and trust for healthcare professionals and patients alike. Educational and training provisions for medical imaging professionals on AI is central to the understanding of basic AI principles and applications and there are many offerings currently in Europe. Education can facilitate the transparency of AI tools, but more formalised, university-led training is needed to ensure the academic scrutiny, appropriate pedagogy, multidisciplinarity and customisation to the learners' unique needs are being adhered to. As radiographers and radiologists work together and with other professionals to understand and harness the benefits of AI in medical imaging, it becomes clear that they are faced with the same challenges and that they have the same needs. The digital future belongs to multidisciplinary teams that work seamlessly together, learn together, manage risk collectively and collaborate for the benefit of the patients they serve.","AI","Ulster University"

While the idea of interacting with a computer using voice or text goes back a long way, it is only in recent years that this idea has become a reality with the emergence of digital personal assistants, smart speakers, and chatbots. Advances in AI, particularly in deep learning, along with the availability of massive computing power and vast amounts of data, have led to a new generation of dialogue systems and conversational interfaces. Current research in Conversational AI focuses mainly on the application of machine learning and statistical data-driven approaches to the development of dialogue systems. However, it is important to be aware of previous achievements in dialogue technology and to consider to what extent they might be relevant to current research and development. Three main approaches to the development of dialogue systems are reviewed: rule-based systems that are handcrafted using best practice guidelines; statistical data-driven systems based on machine learning; and neural dialogue systems based on end-to-end learning. Evaluating the performance and usability of dialogue systems has become an important topic in its own right, and a variety of evaluation metrics and frameworks are described. Finally, a number of challenges for future research are considered, including: multimodality in dialogue systems, visual dialogue; data efficient dialogue model learning; using knowledge graphs; discourse and dialogue phenomena; hybrid approaches to dialogue systems development; dialogue with social robots and in the Internet of Things; and social and ethical issues.","AI","Ulster University"

M.; Khan, S.; Wu, J.; Hadi, M. U.; Heymach, J.; Le, X.; Yan, H.; Alam, T.","31 Jul 2023","The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for novel drug discovery process. However, the journey from conceptualizing a drug to its eventual implementation in clinical settings is a long, complex, and expensive process, with many potential points of failure. Over the past decade, a vast growth in medical information has coincided with advances in computational hardware (cloud computing, GPUs, and TPUs) and the rise of deep learning. Medical data generated from large molecular screening profiles, personal health or pathology records, and public health organizations could benefit from analysis by Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to speed up and prevent failures in the drug discovery pipeline. We present applications of AI at various stages of drug discovery pipelines, including the inherently computational approaches of de novo design and prediction of a drug's likely properties. Open-source databases and AI-based software tools that facilitate drug design are discussed along with their associated problems of molecule representation, data collection, complexity, labeling, and disparities among labels. How contemporary AI methods, such as graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and generated models, along with structure-based methods, (i.e., molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking) can contribute to drug discovery applications and analysis of drug responses is also explored. Finally, recent developments and investments in AI-based start-up companies for biotechnology, drug design and their current progress, hopes and promotions are discussed in this article.","AI","Ulster University"

This paper proposed the framework of AI gait analysis and assessment system eZiGait, which is based on seamless smart insoles. The preliminary study of activity recognition using eZiGait is presented. Walking data for five types of activities including slow walking, normal walking, fast walking, climbing upstairs, and walking down stairs have been investigated. Three classifiers were used, including artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and random forest, to classify the five exercises. Results shows that a classification accuracy of 80% can be achieved with the ANN or 70% with KNN and random forest. This demonstrates that simple features extracted from smart insoles can be used to classify different types of exercise. This provides for potential development of an AI gait analysis and assistant system to support lower limb rehabilitation at hospital, community or at home using state-of-the-art smart insoles and mobile technologies.","AI","Ulster University"

An Exploratory Analysis of Perceived AI Knowledge, Skills, Confidence, and Education Perspectives of UK Radiographers","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/beauty-is-in-the-ai-of-the-beholder-are-we-ready-for-the-clinical","Rainey, C.; O'Regan, T.; Matthew, J.; Skelton, E.; Woznitza, N.; Chu, K-Y.; Goodman, S.; McConnell, J.; Hughes, C.; Bond, RR.; McFadden, S.; Malamateniou, C.","11 Nov 2021","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging and radiotherapy has been met with both scepticism and excitement. However, clinical integration of AI is already well-underway. Many authors have recently reported on the AI knowledge and perceptions of radiologists/medical staff and students however there is a paucity of information regarding radiographers. Published literature agrees that AI is likely to have significant impact on radiology practice. As radiographers are at the forefront of radiology service delivery, an awareness of the current level of their perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI is essential to identify any educational needs necessary for successful adoption into practice. The aim of this survey was to determine the perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI amongst UK radiographers and highlight priorities for educational provisions to support a digital healthcare ecosystem. A survey was created on Qualtrics® and promoted via social media (Twitter®/LinkedIn®). This survey was open to all UK radiographers, including students and retired radiographers. Participants were recruited by convenience, snowball sampling. Demographic information was gathered as well as data on the perceived, self-reported, knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI of respondents. Insight into what the participants understand by the term ""AI"" was gained by means of a free text response. Quantitative analysis was performed using SPSS® and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on NVivo®. Four hundred and eleven responses were collected (80% from diagnostic radiography and 20% from a radiotherapy background), broadly representative of the workforce distribution in the UK. Although many respondents stated that they understood the concept of AI in general (78.7% for diagnostic and 52.1% for therapeutic radiography respondents, respectively) there was a notable lack of sufficient knowledge of AI principles, understanding of AI terminology, skills, and confidence in the use of AI technology. Many participants, 57% of diagnostic and 49% radiotherapy respondents, do not feel adequately trained to implement AI in the clinical setting. Furthermore 52% and 64%, respectively, said they have not developed any skill in AI whilst 62% and 55%, respectively, stated that there is not enough AI training for radiographers. The majority of the respondents indicate that there is an urgent need for further education (77.4% of diagnostic and 73.9% of therapeutic radiographers feeling they have not had adequate training in AI), with many respondents stating that they had to educate themselves to gain some basic AI skills. Notable correlations between confidence in working with AI and gender, age, and highest qualification were reported. Knowledge of AI terminology, principles, and applications by healthcare practitioners is necessary for adoption and integration of AI applications. The results of this survey highlight the perceived lack of knowledge, skills, and confidence for radiographers in applying AI solutions but also underline the need for formalised education on AI to prepare the current and prospective workforce for the upcoming clinical integration of AI in healthcare, to safely and efficiently navigate a digital future. Focus should be given on different needs of learners depending on age, gender, and highest qualification to ensure optimal integration.

"Improving Prospective Healthcare Outcomes by Leveraging Open Data and Explainable AI","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/improving-prospective-healthcare-outcomes-by-leveraging-open-data","Alam, G.; McChesney, I.; Nicholl, P.; Rafferty, J.","10 Oct 2023","The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare can improve diagnosis and clinical workflows, advancing standards and improving outcomes. AI for healthcare raises significant ethical and legal challenges. AI model development and deployment require transparency and interpretability. Transparency is the capacity to comprehend how an AI model makes recommendations, whereas interpretability is the ability to understand why. One such issue is the lack of transparency and interpretability of AI models, which might lead to a lack of trust in its decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) is an emerging research field that tries to solve this problem by creating AI models that can explain their recommendations. AI models need enough data to be accurate and reliable, thus they must be trained on various and extensive data sets. Open data and data sets (ODDS) can aid AI model development and training. Medical images, lab reports, and patient data are used to train algorithms to identify trends and make predictions in healthcare. Open data can help XAI in healthcare to enable AI models to be transparent, accountable, and interpretable. Open data makes possible AI model validation and replication. This is especially crucial in healthcare, where AI model flaws or biases can have serious implications. This paper discusses the use of ODDS and XAI to improve healthcare. ODDS's capability to promote trust and openness and best practices for using XAI in healthcare are also explored. The benefits and challenges of employing XAI and ODDS in their current forms are also discussed.","AI","Ulster University"

"A critical review of AI in accounting education: Threat and opportunity","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-critical-review-of-ai-in-accounting-education-threat-and-opport","Ballantine, J. A.; Boyce, G.; Stoner, G.","18 Jan 2024","In this essay, we contribute to the limited literature that has critically examined the potential implications of generative AI on the accounting academy and accounting education (AE).  We argue that the recent accelerated growth of AI, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, raises significant issues and challenges that the accounting academy needs to urgently address to survive in the long term.  Developments in AI have, we suggest, created a ‘change-inducing crisis’, presenting a unique opportunity for accounting academics to address the uncritical and problematic functionalist view of the discipline and the technical reductionism of accounting.  Our arguments represent a call for action to embrace AI in learning and teaching practices in a way that brings about a renewed focus on the human dimension of accounting, incorporating broader social and critical perspectives, thereby addressing longstanding calls for change in AE to move beyond the technical, managerial, and financial focus (core of the AE curriculum) that has dominated the discipline for many decades.  Accounting academics have a fundamental role to play in recognising the nature of the threats and the associated challenge of AI and to seize the opportunities available in ways that bring both critique and being critical to the fore.  However, to bring about the sort of change we argue for in this essay, the accounting academy has to lead to ‘take education back from the market’ and provide the impetus that can make accounting education more relevant to our students and the needs of contemporary society.

However, signal detection remains a challenging task, and traditional algorithms have shown limited success in Massive MIMO communication systems. To address this, a lightweight AI-based integratable detection scheme called AIDETECT has been proposed in this paper. The AIDETECT model is trained and optimized to achieve superior performance in realistic MIMO and Massive MIMO use case scenarios, and extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate its effectiveness of AIDETECT. The results of this evaluation demonstrate that the proposed AIDETECT scheme outperforms conventional detectors in terms of Symbol Error Rate (SER) for a certain range of SNR. Additionally, this study provides a detailed analysis of the optimal number of deep neural network hidden size layers for different SNR ranges, providing valuable insight into optimizing the performance of lightweight AI models for MIMO and Massive MIMO systems. This paper underscores the potential of deep learning techniques in addressing signal detection challenges and informs future research in this field.","AI","Ulster University"

W.; Finlay, D.; Guldenring, D.; Bond, RR.; McCausland, C.; McLaughlin, J.","22 Oct 2022","Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been shown to provide improved performance over traditional heuristic algorithms for the detection of arrhythmias from ambulatory ECG recordings. However, these DCNNs have primarily been trained and tested on device-specific databases with standardized electrode positions and uniform sampling frequencies. This work explores the possibility of training a DCNN for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection on a database of single‑lead ECG rhythm strips extracted from resting 12‑lead ECGs. We then test the performance of the DCNN on recordings from ambulatory ECG devices with different recording leads and sampling frequencies.We developed an extensive proprietary resting 12‑lead ECG dataset of 549,211 patients. This dataset was randomly split into a training set of 494,289 patients and a testing set of the remaining 54,922 patients. We trained a 34-layer convolutional DCNN to detect AF and other arrhythmias on this dataset. The DCNN was then validated on two Physionet databases commonly used to benchmark automated ECG algorithms (1) MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and (2) MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. Validation was performed following the EC57 guidelines, with performance assessed by gross episode and duration sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Finally, validation was also performed on a selection of rhythm strips from an ambulatory ECG patch that a committee of board-certified cardiologists annotated.On MIT-BIH, The DCNN achieved a sensitivity of 100% and 84% PPV in detecting episodes of AF. and 100% sensitivity and 94% PPV in quantifying AF episode duration. On AFDB, The DCNN achieved a sensitivity of 94% and PPV of 98% in detecting episodes of AF, and 98% sensitivity and 100% PPV in quantifying AF episode duration. On the patch database, the DCNN demonstrated performance that was closely comparable to that of a cardiologist.The results indicate that DCNN models can learn features that generalize between resting 12‑lead and ambulatory ECG recordings, allowing DCNNs to be device agnostic for detecting arrhythmias from single‑lead ECG recordings and enabling a range of clinical applications.","AI","Ulster University"

This work is the first to systematically explore the key facets of human-centred AI for trustworthy RAS. We identified five key properties of a trustworthy RAS, i.e., RAS must be (i) safe in any uncertain and dynamic environment; (ii) secure, i.e., protect itself from cyber threats; (iii) healthy and fault-tolerant; (iv) trusted and easy to use to enable effective human-machine interaction (HMI); (v) compliant with the law and ethical expectations. While the applications of RAS have mainly focused on performance and productivity, not enough scientific attention has been paid to the risks posed by advanced AI in RAS. We analytically examine the challenges of implementing trustworthy RAS with respect to the five key properties and explore the role and roadmap of AI technologies in ensuring the trustworthiness of RAS in respect of safety, security, health, HMI, and ethics. A new acceptance model of RAS is provided as a framework for human-centric AI requirements and for implementing trustworthy RAS by design.

With a national shortage of radiographers and radiologists, artificial intelligence (AI) support in reporting may help minimise the backlog of unreported images.  Modern AI is not well understood by human end-users.  This may have ethical implications and impact human trust in these systems, due to over- and under-reliance.  AimThis study investigates the perceptions of reporting radiographers about AI, gathers information to explain how they may interact with AI in future and identifies features perceived as necessary for appropriate trust in these systems.  MethodsA Qualtrics® survey was designed and piloted by a team of UK AI expert radiographers. This paper reports the third part of the survey, open to reporting radiographers only.  Results86 responses were received. Respondents were confident in how an AI reached its decision (n=53, 62%).  Less than a third of respondents would be confident communicating the AI decision to stakeholders.  Affirmation from AI would improve confidence (n=49, 57%) and disagreement would make respondents seek a second opinion (n=60, 70%).  There is a moderate trust level in AI for image interpretation.  System performance data and AI visual explanations would increase trust. ConclusionsResponses indicate that AI will have a strong impact on reporting radiographers’ decision making in the future.  Respondents are confident in how an AI makes decisions but less confident explaining this to others.  Trust levels could be improved with explainable AI solutions.Implications for practiceThis survey clarifies UK reporting radiographers’ perceptions of AI, used for image interpretation, highlighting key issues with AI integration.","AI","Ulster University"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next frontier which medical imaging is pioneering. The rapid development and implementation of AI has the potential to revolutionise healthcare, however, to do so, staff must be competent and confident in its application, hence AI readiness is an important precursor to AI adoption. Research to ascertain the best way to deliver this AI-enabled healthcare training is in its infancy. The aim of this scoping review is to compare existing studies which investigate and evaluate the efficacy of AI educational interventions for medical imaging staff.    Methods  Following the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, screening was conducted to determine study eligibility. This consisted of a title and abstract scan, then subsequently a full-text review. Articles were included if they were empirical studies wherein an educational intervention on AI for medical imaging staff was created, delivered, and evaluated.    Results  Of the initial 1309 records returned, n = 5 (∼0.4 %) of studies met the eligibility criteria of the review. The curricula and delivery in each of the five studies shared similar aims and a ‘flipped classroom’ delivery was the most utilised method. However, the depth of content covered in the curricula of each varied and measured outcomes differed greatly.

U.; Charles, D.; Pfuhl, G.; Rusanen, A-M.","6 Nov 2022","In this chapter, we reflect on the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a pedagogical and educational instrument, and the challenges that arise to ensure transparency and fairness to staff and students . We describe a thought experiment: ``simulation of AI in education as a massively multiplayer social online game'' (AIEd-MMOG). Here, all actors (humans, institutions, AI agents and algorithms) are required to conform to the definition of a player. Models of player behaviour that `understand' the game space provide an application-programming interface for typical algorithms, e.g. deep learning neural nets or reinforcement learning agents, to interact with humans and the game space. The definition of `player' is a role designed to maximise protection and benefit for human players during interaction with AI. The concept of benefit maximisation is formally defined as a Rawlsian justice game, played within the AIEd-MMOG to facilitate transparency and trust of the algorithms involved, without requiring algorithm-specific technical solutions to, e.g. `peek inside the black box'. Our thought experiment for an AIEd-MMOG simulation suggests solutions for the well-known challenges of explainable AI and distributive justice.","AI","Ulster University"

This paper describes the development of a large language model (LLM) augmentation chatbot and user interface that provides responses to research queries in the domain of computer science. Around 200,000 computer science research papers from arXiv were embedded, resulting in ~11 million vectors (based on ‘chunks’ from the papers). Each vector is comprised of 384 numbers/dimensions. Technologies used include Langchain, a Vector Database, and Semantic Searching with document / query embeddings. The chatbot was tested using 30 sample questions that could be asked by computer science students across several topics and from different education levels (i.e., BSc, MSc and PhD level). The responses from this chatbot were compared with those from GPT-4. The responses with and without prompting were also compared. Readability metrics (Flesch-Kincaid and Coleman-Liau) were used to compare the responses from this LLM with GPT-4. Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment (RAGAS), a novel LLM self-evaluation method was used to evaluate the system.

The volume of data collected by the sensors from detailed recordings of long-term movement data can become enormous, making it challenging to manually extract movement information with any degree of certainty. The goal of this research was to create an automated system capable of extracting standardized functional test (SFT) patterns from wearable devices worn in an ambulatory environment. The datasets used in this study contained movement data from 40 people living with axial spondylo arthritis. Each participant in this study completed a series of SFTs. The first session was completed in a clinical setting, and the second session at each participant's home.

The aim of the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including all staff, volunteers, students and learners.    Methods  The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review. Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback received and a final consensus was reached.    Results  AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions. Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients and service users.    Conclusion  Radiography is starting to work towards a future with AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice.  Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education, research and the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders are discussed, with potential impact on policy and practice in all these domains. These recommendations aim to serve as baseline guidance for UK radiographers.    Implications for practice  This review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners, researchers, academics and service users of clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography services. Radiography practice, education and research must gradually adjust to AI-enabled healthcare systems to ensure gains of AI technologies are maximised and challenges and risks are minimised.

The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice in the last five years has been met with scepticism by some, who predict the demise of the profession, whilst others suggest a bright future with AI, full of opportunities and synergies. Post COVID-19 pandemic need for economic recovery and a backlog of medical imaging and reporting may accelerate the adoption of AI. It is therefore timely to appreciate practitioners' perceptions of AI used in clinical practice and their perception of the short-term impact on the profession. This study aims to explore the perceptions of AI in the UK radiography workforce and to investigate its current AI applications and future technological expectations of radiographers. An online survey (Qualtrics ) was created by a team of radiography AI experts. The survey was disseminated via social media and professional networks in the UK. Demographic information and perceptions of the impact of AI on several aspects of the radiography profession were gathered, including the current use of AI in practice, future expectations and the perceived impact of AI on the profession. 411 responses were collected (80% diagnostic radiographers (DR); 20% therapeutic radiographers (TR)). Awareness of AI used in clinical practice is low, with DR respondents suggesting AI will have the most value/potential in cross sectional imaging and image reporting. TR responses linked AI as having most value in treatment planning, contouring, and image acquisition/matching. Respondents felt that AI will impact radiographers' daily work (DR, 79.6%; TR, 88.9%) by standardising some aspects of patient care and technical factors of radiography practice. A mixed response about impact on careers was reported. Respondents were unsure about the ways in which AI is currently used in practice and how AI will impact on careers in the future. It was felt that AI integration will lead to increased job opportunities to contribute to decision making as an end user. Job security was not identified as a cause for concern.

V1 and V2 are commonly misplaced in the superior direction from their correct position, which can mimic or conceal abnormalities. The aim of the current study is to use artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of deep learning to detect V1 and V2 lead misplacement to enhance ECG data quality and to make the black box decisions of AI systems more transparentby providing AI attention maps.Methods: V1 and V2 signals were collected from 453 patients (normal n=151, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) n=151, Myocardial Infarction n=151) and extracted using a high-resolution body surface potential maps (BSPM) and converted into RGB images. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 68 layers was developed and trained to classify the ECG images of V1 and V2 into correct and incorrect placement. An attention map was generated and analysedfor each ECG image in the last convolution layer to show the most important features (see figure 1) that have been selected by the CNN. CNN has been trained on 67% of the data and tested on 33%.Results: Using CNN with 68 layers, the accuracy of detecting lead misplacement was 92.6% (TN=291/300, TP=265/300, FP=9/300, FN=35/300). Based on attention maps, P waves (56%), T waves (55%) and R (48%) waves contributed the most to the predicted classes correct and incorrect (see table 1). The S wave was not considered important in most cases in detecting correct V1 and V2 placement. The other features, including the PR interval, Q wave and J pointcontributed 29%, 17% and 27% respectively to the predicted classes correct and incorrect.Conclusions: Deep CNN achieved a high accuracy (92.6%) to detect V1 and V2 lead misplacement, whilst increasing the transparency of the algorithmic decision making. Attention maps demonstrate what the algorithm ’looked at’ prior to making it’s decision, which alsoelucidate areas of the ECG that are most important in detecting lead misplacement. Physicians can use the attention map to calibrate their trust with the machine and to consider the machine’s attention (a proxy for machine rationale). According to the generated attention maps, the P waves, T waves and R waves were considered the most important features, while the S wave was considered as the least important feature. Whilst the other features PR interval, Q waveand J point are considered as mid-level features.","AI","Ulster University"

It is then necessary to count on agile and robust methodological approaches predicting the expected demand loads to EDs while supporting the timely allocation of ventilators. In this paper, we propose an integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Discrete-event Simulation (DES) to design effective interventions ensuring the high availability of ventilators for patients needing these devices. MethodsFirst, we applied Random Forest (RF) to estimate the mechanical ventilation probability of respiratory-affected patients entering the emergency wards. Second, we introduced the RF predictions into a DES model to diagnose the response of EDs in terms of mechanical ventilator availability. Lately, we pretested two different interventions suggested by decision-makers to address the scarcity of this resource. A case study in a European hospital group was used to validate the proposed methodology. ResultsThe number of patients in the training cohort was 734, while the test group comprised 315. The sensitivity of the AI model was 93.08% (95% confidence interval, [88.46 − 96.26%]), whilst the specificity was 85.45% [77.45 − 91.45%]. On the other hand, the positive and negative predictive values were 91.62% (86.75 − 95.13%) and 87.85% (80.12 − 93.36%). Also, the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve plot was 95.00% (89.25 − 100%). Finally, the median waiting time for mechanical ventilation was decreased by 17.48% after implementing a new resource capacity strategy. ConclusionsCombining AI and DES helps healthcare decision-makers to elucidate interventions shortening the waiting times for mechanical ventilators in EDs during respiratory disease epidemics and pandemics.","AI","Ulster University"

The performance of different regression-based models is compared with the gradient boosting model (GB) to show the relative merits and demerits of the technique. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method was utilised to explain individual predictions. This study demonstrates that the prediction performance of the GB algorithm was the best among other regression-based models i.e. Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer perception (MLP), Ridge Regression (RR), Least-angle regression (LARS), Random Forest (RF) and Bagging (BAG). It was found that at learning rate (lr) 0.01 and number of boosting stages (est) 1000 yielded the best result with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0597 for all outputs.

In this work, an artificial intelligence approach based on the improved multiscale coupled electro-thermal model is employed for the first time to accurately predict the thermal behavior of a 350 F supercapacitor module under air-cooling conditions. Different from previous work that used commercial cells, the 350 F supercapacitors are fabricated from our proprietary pilot-scale production line. This approach provides a platform to precisely measure the structural parameters, electrical and thermal properties of electrodes and electrolytes (e.g., the temperature/current dependent equivalent series resistance and axial/radial thermal characteristics), which can improve the model for characterizing the irreversible heat generation and thermal transport processes. In particular, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations, the molecular origin of entropy is revealed via probing the atomic-level information (e.g., 1D/2D electric double-layer structure, electrical field/potential distributions, areal capacitance, and diffusion kinetics) to accurately predict the reversible heat generation. As a consequence, the deviation between our improved model and experimental results is substantially reduced to below 5%. A deep neural network based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach is trained to build a temperature database for practical supercapacitor modules under different operating conditions (including charging/discharging currents, cooling airflow rates, and cycle duration). This work demonstrates the potential of LSTM in predicting the thermal behavior, which can be broadly used for industry-relevant thermal management applications.","AI","Ulster University"

Other performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score also returned results that are higher than 90% for each of the three models thus making them suitable for detecting and classifying small to medium-sized image datasets.","AI","Ulster University"
"SPICED-ACS: Study of the Potential Impact of a Computer-generated ECG Diagnostic Algorithmic Certainty Index in STEMI diagnosis: towards transparent AI","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/spiced-acs-study-of-the-potential-impact-of-a-computer-generated-","Knoery, C.; Bond, RR.; Iftikhar, A.; Rjoob, K.; McGilligan, V. E.; Peace, A.; Heaton, J.; Leslie, S.","1 Nov 2019","Background: Computerised electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation diagnostic algorithms have been developed to guide clinical decisions like with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) where time in decision making is critical. These computer-generated diagnoses have been proven to strongly influence the final ECG diagnosis by the clinician; often called automation bias. However, the computerised diagnosis may be inaccurate and could result in a wrong or delayed treatment harm to the patient. We hypothesise that an algorithmic certainty index alongside a computer-generated diagnosis might mitigate automation bias. The impact of reporting a certainty index on the final diagnosis is not known. Purpose: To ascertain whether knowledge of the computer-generated ECG algorithmic certainty index influences operator diagnostic accuracy. Methodology: Clinicians who regularly analyse ECGs such as cardiology or acute care doctors, cardiac nurses and ambulance staff were invited to complete an online anonymous survey between March and April 2019. The survey had 36 ECGs with a clinical vignette of a typical chest pain and which were either a STEMI, normal, or borderline (but do not fit the STEMI criteria) along with an artificially created certainty index that was either high, medium, low or none. Participants were asked whether the ECG showed a STEMI and their confidence in the diagnosis. The primary outcomes were whether a computer-generated certainty index influenced interpreter's diagnostic decisions and improved their diagnostic accuracy. Secondary outcomes were influence of certainty index between different types of clinicians and influence of certainty index on user's own-diagnostic confidence. Results: A total of 91 participants undertook the survey and submitted 3262 ECG interpretations of which 75% of ECG interpretations were correct. Presence of a certainty index significantly increased the odds ratio of a correct ECG interpretation (OR 1.063, 95% CI 1.022–1.106, p = 0.004) but there was no significant difference between correct certainty index and incorrect certainty index (OR 1.028, 95% CI 0.923–1.145, p = 0.615). There was a trend for low certainty index to increase odds ratio compared to no certainty index (OR 1.153, 95% CI 0.898–1.482, p = 0.264) but a high certainty index significantly decreased the odds ratio of a correct ECG interpretation (OR 0.492, 95% CI 0.391–0.619, p < 0.001). There was no impact of presence of a certainty index (p = 0.528) or correct certainty index (p = 0.812) on interpreters' confidence in their ECG interpretation. Conclusions: Our results show that the presence of an ECG certainty index improves the users ECG interpretation accuracy. This effect is not seen with differing levels of confidence within a certainty index, with reduced ECG interpretation success with a high certainty index compared with a trend for increased success with a low certainty index. This suggests that a certainty index improves interpretation when there is an increased element of doubt, possibly forcing the ECG user to spend more time and effort analysing the ECG. Further research is needed looking at time spent analysing differing certainty indices with alternate ECG diagnoses.","AI","Ulster University"

In particular, social computing was significantly influenced by the recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the conventional technologies of AI have various drawbacks in dealing with complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows some advantages over the conventional AI. This article firstly reviews the latest research progresses of AI in social computing. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges AI faces in social computing, which motivate the necessity to introduce H-AI to tackle social-oriented problems. Finally, we discuss the concept of H-AI and propose a holistic architecture of H-AI in social computing, which consists of three layers: object layer, intelligent processing layer, and application layer. The proposed architecture shows that H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.","AI","Ulster University"

The paper outlines AI applications in interventional cardiology from diagnosis (AI based cardiac diagnostics), to treatment (AI in the Cath-lab) and recovery (AI based patient rehabilitation, patient monitoring and automated clinical feedback). AI applications at the diagnostic phase can include the use of machine learning to assist in clinical decision making, for example when triaging patients, reading 12-lead electrocardiograms to auto-detect coronary occlusions (not just ST elevation myocardial infarctions or STEMIs) or predicting patient mortality. Opportunities for AI applications at the peri-intervention stage can include computer vision to aid angiographic analysis, which comprise of automatic tracking of coronary arteries and anatomy to automated thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) and syntax scoring systems (an angiographic tool) which can be used to grade complexity of coronary artery disease by grading 11 types of lesions including (Total occlusion, Trifurcation, Bifurcation, Aorto, Dominance, Length, Heavy calcification, Thrombus, Diffuse disease, Number of diseased segments, Tortuosity). Post-intervention AI opportunities might involve intelligent monitoring systems to track patients and AI chatbot technologies to provide personalized coaching for cardiac rehabilitation to improve recovery and reduce readmissions. Automated activity logging in the Cath-Lab using internet of things systems, sensors and cameras could also be used in the post-intervention phase to provide clinical feedback to cardiology teams showing important trends, associations and patterns during procedures. Whilst these opportunities exist, there are also non-technological challenges such as regulatory and ethical challenges related to the deployment of AI systems.","AI","Ulster University"
"A Review of the Methods, Applications, and Challenges of Adopting Artificial Intelligence in the Property Assessment Office","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-review-of-the-methods-applications-and-challenges-of-adopting-a","","20 Jun 2022","In early 2020, IAAO President Amy Rasmussen created the Artificial Intelligence Task Force with the goal of developing a white paper describing the impact and uses of artificial intelligence (AI) in government valuation offices. The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 forced government valuation offices to adapt overnight. Many jurisdictions rapidly virtualized tasks and duties, which accelerated ongoing efforts to utilize office automation and implement intelligent software solutions. More and more, workflows incorporating digital information and multiple sources of data are processed and analyzed using software and integrated applications. The fully integrated workflows facilitate the increased usage of AI in operations, assessment, and valuation. This white paper delivers an introduction and overview of AI through case and pilot studies and review of relevant analytic methods while touching on possible organizational impacts. The paper looks at the changing role of valuers and assessment administrators and the evolution of valuation offices where AI will be used to improve operations, value estimates, and administration. It provides illustrative examples of AI use in the conduct of tax assessment, including the administrative aspects not directly involved in valuation. While there is substantial fanfare around valuation with AI, many of the benefits to be realized from the technology are in areas of administration, validation, and oversight. This is reflected in the case studies included, with more than half involving AI applications outside of the explicit valuation function. The introduction provides a definition and brief history of AI. It also helps disentangle the raft of AI methods with how they are used and provides a concrete list of which assessment activities may benefit from those general classes of algorithms. More importantly, the first section helps put into context why AI is becoming more widespread and what that means for organizations from both staffing and administration standpoints. After the introduction’s overview of what AI is, why it has captured professional imagination, and the organizational changes it portends, we provide examples of current uses by assessing organizations and their partners. The first case study is about the Property Valuation Services Corporation’s (PVSC) foray as the first organization in Canada to publish a tax assessment roll using AI-based valuations. This case study highlights the multiyear process leading the organization to that accomplishment and the lessons it learned along the way. The second use case is a pilot study by PVSC. The section discusses the success of AI, particularly machine-learning methods, for the valuation of residential properties in the Netherlands. The third use case is from BC Assessment (BCA) and describes how valuations of manufactured homes were conducted using AI methods. For successful adoption of AI in an assessment office, this case study highlights the importance of communication and feedback from appraisers and integration of AI-modeled values with the computer-assisted mass appraisal (CAMA) system. The fourth case study comes from the City of New York and showcases applications using AI to better manage form intake and processing. Using optical character recognition (OCR), it is possible to process the volumes of senior exemption applications and condominium declaration forms received in paper and PDF formats. As with the other case examples, the results still require human oversight but provide a significant improvement over the existing process. The fifth use case also comes from the City of New York. This section discusses how geospatial data and AI methods are being integrated and leveraged to determine land use, detect building changes, and extract parcel data from images and may be used to automate data collection. This section also gives background on the geospatial data required to leverage land use and building change detection applications, which are growing increasingly familiar and important to tax assessment organizations. The sixth application involves integrating AI-powered valuation as a feature within CAMA. To illustrate the potential of AI to automate sales-based valuation models, this study examines Tyler Technologies’ experience trying to provide an AI-powered valuation option for its users. It also clarifies the technology’s perceived limitations, which create headwinds for widespread adoption. This section ends with a discussion of international adoption of AI in property assessment offices in four African nations: Rwanda, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. The full digitalization of their records and workflows using imagery and modern technology allows them to modernize their systems without going through and updating legacy records and operational processes found in more established assessment jurisdictions. Following the case studies, the reader will find a section delving deeper into the core machine learning (ML) and AI methods underpinning these applications. ML is covered in the first part of this section. Other methods discussed cover key concepts in artificial neural networks and search and optimization, which underpin virtually every AI application. Finally, the paper closes with recommendations. Key takeaways are that some tax assessment organizations and their partners are already cautiously adopting AI. The technology’s adoption will grow more widespread and touch every tax assessment organization. As such, familiarity with how it is being used, a basic understanding of what is driving these changes, and what they mean for your organization are important.","AI","Ulster University"

This can reduce the need for labelled data across a range of downstream tasks. It was hypothesised that wave segmentation would be a useful form of electrocardiogram (ECG) representation learning. In addition to reducing labelled data requirements, segmentation masks may provide a mechanism for explainable AI. This study details the development and evaluation of a Wave Segmentation Pretraining (WaSP) application. Materials and Methods: Pretraining: A non-AI-based ECG signal and image simulator was developed to generate ECGs and wave segmentation masks. U-Net models were trained to segment waves from synthetic ECGs. Dataset: The raw sample files from the PTB-XL dataset were downloaded. Each ECG was also plotted into an image. Fine-tuning and evaluation: A hold-out approach was used with a 60:20:20 training/validation/test set split. The encoder portions of the U-Net models were fine-tuned to classify PTB-XL ECGs for two tasks: sinus rhythm (SR) vs atrial fibrillation (AF), and myocardial infarction (MI) vs normal ECGs. The fine-tuning was repeated without pretraining. Results were compared. Explainable AI: an example pipeline combining AI-derived segmentation masks and a rule-based AF detector was developed and evaluated. Results: WaSP consistently improved model performance on downstream tasks for both ECG signals and images. The difference between non-pretrained models and models pretrained for wave segmentation was particularly marked for ECG image analysis. A selection of segmentation masks are shown. An AF detection algorithm comprising both AI and rule-based components performed less well than end-to-end AI models but its outputs are proposed to be highly explainable. An example output is shown. Conclusion: WaSP using synthetic data and labels allows AI models to learn useful features for downstream ECG analysis with real-world data. Segmentation masks provide an intermediate output that may facilitate confidence calibration in the context of end-to-end AI. It is possible to combine AI-derived segmentation masks and rule-based diagnostic classifiers for explainable ECG analysis.","AI","Ulster University"

The National Health Service in the UK has prioritised AI and Digital health as part of its Long-Term Plan. Few studies have examined the human interaction with such systems in healthcare, despite reports of biases being present with the use of AI in other technologically advanced fields, such as finance and aviation. Understanding is needed of how certain user characteristics may impact how radiographers engage with AI systems in use in the clinical setting to mitigate against problems before they arise. The aim of this study is to determine correlations of skills, confidence in AI and perceived knowledge amongst student and qualified radiographers in the UK healthcare system. A machine learning based AI model was built to predict if the interpreter was either a student (n = 67) or a qualified radiographer (n = 39) in advance, using important variables from a feature selection technique named Boruta. A survey, which required the participant to interpret a series of plain radiographic examinations with and without AI assistance, was created on the Qualtrics survey platform and promoted via social media (Twitter/LinkedIn), therefore adopting convenience, snowball sampling This survey was open to all UK radiographers, including students and retired radiographers.Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed that males who were proficient in their profession were more likely than females to trust AI. Trust in AI was negatively correlated with age and with level of experience. A machine learning model was built, the best model predicted the image interpreter to be qualified radiographers with 0.93 area under curve and a prediction accuracy of 93%. Further testing in prospective validation cohorts using a larger sample size is required to determine the clinical utility of the proposed machine learning model.","AI","Ulster University"

Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially aid the training process in the field of kidney cancer. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can create a framework for kidney cancer surgery to address training difficulties. Following PRISMA 2020 criteria, an exhaustive search of PubMed and SCOPUS databases was conducted without any filters or restrictions. Inclusion criteria encompassed original English articles focusing on AI’s role in kidney cancer surgical training. On the other hand, all non-original articles and articles published in any language other than English were excluded. Two independent reviewers assessed the articles, with a third party settling any disagreement. Study specifics, AI tools, methodologies, endpoints, and outcomes were extracted by the same authors. The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine’s evidence levels were employed to assess the studies. Out of 468 identified records, 14 eligible studies were selected. Potential AI applications in kidney cancer surgical training include analyzing surgical workflow, annotating instruments, identifying tissues, and 3D reconstruction. AI is capable of appraising surgical skills, including the identification of procedural steps and instrument tracking. While AI and augmented reality (AR) enhance training, challenges persist in real-time tracking and registration. The utilization of AI-driven 3D reconstruction proves beneficial for intraoperative guidance and preoperative preparation. Artificial intelligence (AI) shows potential for advancing surgical training by providing unbiased evaluations, personalized feedback, and enhanced learning processes. Yet challenges such as consistent metric measurement, ethical concerns, and data privacy must be addressed. The integration of AI into kidney cancer surgical training offers solutions to training difficulties and a boost to surgical education.

Given AI is becoming more prevalent and maybe regarded as the new ‘electricity’, it is imperative that human needs, interests and values are centered around all future AI developments. Given Human Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers created user centered design principles and practices based on human factors psychology, they are best placed to work with AI engineers to establish Human-Centered AI (HAI) or Human-AI interaction solutions. This paper presents the challenges that would provide HAI solutions, including the need for explainable AI (XAI) in algorithmic decision making and the need to mitigate automation bias which is when humans over trust and accept computer-based advice. Other ethical HAI challenges are outlined including algorithmic bias and ethical chatbots as well as a discussion on the likely democratisation of AI with the aid of end-user machine learning. The challenges that are discussed herein need addressed in order to properly calibrate human-machine trust and to provide a responsible basis for the future of human-machine symbiosis.","AI","Ulster University"
"Artificial intelligence for suicide assessment using Audiovisual Cues: a review","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/artificial-intelligence-for-suicide-assessment-using-audiovisual-","Dhelim, S.; Chen, L.; Ning, H.; Nugent, CD.","2 Nov 2022","Death by suicide is the seventh leading death cause worldwide. The recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically AI applications in image and voice processing, has created a promising opportunity to revolutionize suicide risk assessment. Subsequently, we have witnessed fast-growing literature of research that applies AI to extract audiovisual non-verbal cues for mental illness assessment. However, the majority of the recent works focus on depression, despite the evident difference between depression symptoms and suicidal behavior non-verbal cues. In this paper, we review the recent works that study suicide ideation and suicide behavior detection through audiovisual feature analysis, mainly suicidal voice/speech acoustic features analysis and suicidal visual cues. Automatic suicide assessment is a promising research direction that is still in the early stages. Accordingly, there is a lack of large datasets that can be used to train machine leaning and deep learning models proven to be effective in other, similar tasks.","AI","Ulster University"
"Examining the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Evaluation of Banking Risk","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/examining-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-the-evaluation","Swankie, G. D. B.; Broby, D.","28 Nov 2019","This paper examines the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and banking risk management. The global financial crisis highlighted their importance and now banks are subject to more stringent regulation regarding their capital adequacy. Meanwhile, advances in technology are driving changes in the way banks operate. AI is at the core of this and has the potential to revolutionise financial services. It is comprised of several techniques that allow computers to mimic human behavior and analyse vast quantities of data in seconds. These techniques include machine learning, deep learning, speech recognition, natural language processing and visual recognition. We investigate the extent to which each of these techniques can be implemented in the context of financial services. In this respect, we look at credit, operational, liquidity and reputational risk, all of which can have a negative impact on the earnings of an organisation. AI has the potential to help mitigate these risks in banks and address some of the highlighted management issues. We conclude that the application of AI can add significant economic value to banking operations.","AI","Ulster University"

However, the translation of insights and drugs discovered in model systems has proven immensely challenging, marred by high failure rates in human clinical trials. METHODS: Here we review the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in experimental medicine for dementia research. RESULTS: Considering the specific challenges of reproducibility and translation between other species or model systems and human biology in preclinical dementia research, we highlight best practices and resources that can be leveraged to quantify and evaluate translatability. We then evaluate how AI and ML approaches could be applied to enhance both cross‐model reproducibility and translation to human biology, while sustaining biological interpretability. DISCUSSION: AI and ML approaches in experimental medicine remain in their infancy. However, they have great potential to strengthen preclinical research and translation if based upon adequate, robust, and reproducible experimental data. Highlights: There are increasing applications of AI in experimental medicine. We identified issues in reproducibility, cross‐species translation, and data curation in the field. Our review highlights data resources and AI approaches as solutions. Multi‐omics analysis with AI offers exciting future possibilities in drug discovery.","AI","Ulster University"

These two models represent different attitudes of people towards the perceived conflict between beliefs. In both models agents have a degree of tolerance, which represents the extent to which the agent takes into account the differing beliefs of other agents, and a degree of conflict, which represents the extent to which two beliefs are considered to be competing. Computer simulations are used to determine how the opinion dynamics are affected by the inclusion of conflict. Results show that conflict can enhance the formation of consensus within the network in certain circumstances according to one of the models.","AI","Ulster University"

Following application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, sixteen studies were included in the final review.ResultsWith the exception of one study, all studies report that AI models demonstrated an ability to perform fracture identification tasks on plain skeletal radiographs. Metrics used to report performance are variable throughout all reviewed studies and include area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy. Reported performances for studies indicated AUC values range from AUC 0.78 (weakest) to the best performing system reporting AUC 0.99.ConclusionThe review found a great variation in the AI model architectures, training and testing methodology as well as the metrics used to report the performance of the networks. A standardisation of the reporting metrics and methods would permit comparison of proposed models and training methods which may accelerate the testing of AI systems in the clinical setting. Prevalence agnostic metrics should be used to reflect the true performance of such systems. Many studies lacked any explainability for the algorithmic decision making of the AI models, and there was a lack of interrogation into the potential reasons for misclassification errors. This type of ‘failure analysis’ would have provided insight into the biases and the aetiology of AI misclassifications. ","AI","Ulster University"

J.","24 Feb 2023","Progress in dementia research has been limited, with substantial gaps in our knowledge of targets for prevention, mechanisms for disease progression, and disease-modifying treatments. The growing availability of multimodal datasets opens possibilities for the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to help answer key questions in the field. We provide an overview of the state of the science, highlighting current challenges and opportunities for utilisation of AI approaches to move the field forward in the areas of genetics, experimental medicine, drug discovery and trials optimisation, imaging, and prevention. Machine learning methods can enhance results of genetic studies, help determine biological effects and facilitate the identification of drug targets based on genetic and transcriptomic information. The use of unsupervised learning for understanding disease mechanisms for drug discovery is promising, while analysis of multimodal datasets to characterise and quantify disease severity and subtype are also beginning to contribute to optimisation of clinical trial recruitment. Data-driven experimental medicine is needed to analyse data across modalities and develop novel algorithms to translate insights from animal models to human disease biology. AI methods in neuroimaging outperform traditional approaches for diagnostic classification and although challenges around validation and translation remain, there is optimism for their meaningful integration to clinical practice in the near future. AI-based models can also clarify our understanding of the causality and commonality of dementia risk factors, informing and improving risk prediction models along with the development of preventative interventions. The complexity and heterogeneity of dementia requires an alternative approach beyond traditional design and analytical approaches. Although not yet widely used in dementia research, machine learning and AI have the potential to unlock current challenges and advance precision dementia medicine.  ","AI","Ulster University"

Á.; de Sesmaisons-Lecarré, A.; Naska, A.","Oct 2016","Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derives dietary reference values (DRVs) for potassium. The Panel decides to set DRVs on the basis of the relationships between potassium intake and blood pressure and stroke. The Panel considers that randomised controlled trials and an observational cohort study carried out in a European adult population provide evidence that a potassium intake of 3,500 mg (90 mmol)/day has beneficial effects on blood pressure in adults. Furthermore, there is consistent evidence from observational cohort studies that potassium intakes below 3,500 mg/day are associated with a higher risk of stroke. Available data cannot be used to determine the average requirement of potassium but can be used as a basis for deriving an adequate intake (AI). A potassium intake of 3,500 mg/day is considered adequate for the adult population and an AI of 3,500 mg/day for adult men and women is proposed. For infants and children, the AIs are extrapolated from the AI for adults by isometric scaling and including a growth factor. An AI of 750 mg (19 mmol)/day is set for infants aged 7–11 months. For children, AIs from 800 mg (20 mmol)/day (1–3 years old) to 3,500 mg/day (15–17 years old) are set. Considering that the daily accretion rate of potassium in fetal and maternal tissues can be met by the adaptive changes which maintain potassium homeostasis during pregnancy, the AI set for adults applies to pregnant women. For lactating women, the amount of potassium needed to compensate for the losses of potassium through breast milk is estimated and an AI of 4,000 mg (102 mmol)/day is proposed.","AI","Ulster University"

Thus, we investigated the association of objectively and subjectively measured VI with SB in adults aged ≥18 years across 6 LMICs.METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) were analyzed. Objective and subjective visual acuity were measured. Information on self-reported SB was also collected. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess associations with time spent in SB as the outcome.RESULTS: The sample consisted of 42,489 individuals (mean age = 43.8 [14.4] y; 50.1% females). Only severe objective VI (vs no VI) was significantly associated with ≥11 hours per day of SB (vs <4 h/d) (odds ratio = 4.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-12.92). Increasing severity of subjective VI was associated with greater odds for ≥8 hours per day of SB (vs <4 h/d) dose dependently.CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified an association of both objectively and subjectively measured VI with time spent in SB in adults residing in LMICs, with subjectively measured VI being a stronger predictor of time spent in SB. Targeted interventions to decrease SB especially in those who perceive themselves to have VI are needed in LMICs.","AI","Ulster University"

Considerable debate remains about these risk factors, possible interactions between them or with genetic risk, and causality, and how they can help in clinical trial recruitment and drug development. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) may refine understanding. METHODS: ML approaches are being developed in dementia prevention. We discuss exemplar uses and evaluate the current applications and limitations in the dementia prevention field. RESULTS: Risk‐profiling tools may help identify high‐risk populations for clinical trials; however, their performance needs improvement. New risk‐profiling and trial‐recruitment tools underpinned by ML models may be effective in reducing costs and improving future trials. ML can inform drug‐repurposing efforts and prioritization of disease‐modifying therapeutics. DISCUSSION: ML is not yet widely used but has considerable potential to enhance precision in dementia prevention. Highlights: Artificial intelligence (AI) is not widely used in the dementia prevention field. Risk‐profiling tools are not used in clinical practice. Causal insights are needed to understand risk factors over the lifespan. AI will help personalize risk‐management tools for dementia prevention.

T.; Koyanagi, A.","Dec 2021","Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide in young people aged 15-19 years. However, little is known about the correlates of multiple suicide attempts in adolescents, especially from a global perspective. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association of putative physical, behavioral, and social correlates with multiple suicide attempts among adolescents aged 12-15 years from 61 countries. Data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey (2009-2017) were analyzed. Multiple suicide attempts was classified as having attempted suicide at least twice in the past 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the potential correlates. Data on 162,994 adolescents [mean (SD) age 13.8 (0.9) years; 50.8% boys] were analyzed. The overall prevalence of multiple suicide attempts was 4.4% [range 1.2% (Laos) to 13.8% (Ghana)]. Among those who had attempted suicide at least once in the past 12 months, in the overall sample, food insecurity, smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis use, amphetamine use, sedentary behavior, sexual intercourse, sleep problems, loneliness, no close friends, and bullying victimization were all independently associated with higher odds for multiple suicide attempts although some regional differences were observed. Our study results indicate potential target factors that could be addressed amongst those who had attempted suicide in the past to reduce future suicide attempts and possibly completed suicides. Furthermore, it is possible that region-specific interventions are necessary. [Abstract copyright: Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.]","AI","Ulster University"

The methods are based on adaptive filters (AdF), neural networks (NN), and the space-time of an averaged beat for subsequent removal from the ECG signal, the comparison is made with reference to the results obtained with the adaptive filtering method by Thakor. The results show that the methods based on NN and AdF are more robust to morphological changes of the signal and in the presence of noise than non-adaptive methods, also have the advantage that they do not require a pre-detection stage of QRST, however, for the average beat alignment method, best results are obtained when there are no QRS detection failures.","AI","Ulster University"

A.; Il Shin, J.; Koyanagi, A.","25 Mar 2021","Background:: Data on the association between visual difficulty and physical activity (PA) from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are scarce. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the association between visual difficulty and PA among adults from 36 LMICs, and to assess the mediators in this association. Methods:: Cross-sectional, community-based, predominantly nationally representative data from the World Health Survey were analysed. The final sample included 199,110 individuals aged ≥18 years [mean (SD) age 38.6 (16.1) years; 49.4% males]. Visual difficulty referred to having severe/extreme difficulties in seeing and recognizing a person that the participant knows across the road. Low PA was defined as not complying with PA recommendations of 150 min of moderate-vigorous PA per week. Multivariable logistic regression, meta-analysis, and mediation analysis were conducted to assess associations. Results:: Meta-analysis based on country-wise multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that overall, visual difficulty is associated with a 1.53 (95% CI = 1.38–1.71) times higher odds for low PA. Particularly strong associations were observed in males (OR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.45–2.05) and adults aged ≥65 years (OR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.67–2.29). Interpersonal activities, cognition, and sleep/energy explained >10% of the association between visual difficulty and low PA. Conclusions:: In conclusion, we found evidence that especially in the case of males and older adults with visual difficulties in LMICs, there were low levels of engagement with PA. Addressing issues such as interpersonal activities, cognition, and sleep/energy in people with visual difficulties may increase levels of PA.","AI","Ulster University"

However, this association has been little studied to date in low-income settings. Objective To investigate the association between sleep problems and MCI in a large sample of adults from six low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Design Cross-sectional. Setting Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE). Subjects 32,715 individuals aged ≥50 years with preservation in functional abilities [age range 50–114 years; 51.7% females]. Methods MCI was defined using the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria. Sleep problems were assessed by the question “Overall in the last 30 days, how much of a problem did you have with sleeping, such as falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning?” and categorized as “None”, “Mild”, “Moderate”, “Severe/Extreme”. Multivariable logistic regression analysis and meta-analysis were conducted. Results Compared to no sleep problems, mild, moderate, and severe/extreme sleep problems were associated with significant 1.40, 1.83, and 2.69 times higher odds for MCI with similar associations being observed between age groups and sex. Severe/extreme sleep problems were positively associated with MCI (i.e., OR > 1) in the six countries studied with the overall estimate being OR = 1.80 (95% CI = 1.50–2.16), and a low level of between-country heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 28.2%). Conclusions Sleep problems were associated with higher odds for MCI. Interventions to improve sleep quality among middle-aged and older adults in LMICs may be an effective strategy in reducing risk of MCI and dementia.","AI","Ulster University"

Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between pain and sarcopenia using nationally representative samples of older adults from 6 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and to identify potential mediators. Methods Cross-sectional data from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) were analyzed. Sarcopenia was defined as having low skeletal muscle mass and weak handgrip strength, while the presence and severity of pain in the last 30 days were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were performed. The control variables included age, sex, education, wealth, and chronic conditions, while affect, sleep/energy, disability, social participation, sedentary behavior, and mobility were considered potential mediators. Results Data on 14,585 adults aged ≥65 years were analyzed (mean [SD] age 72.6 [11.5] years; 55.0% females). Compared to no pain, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme pain were associated with 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–1.94), 1.43 (95%CI = 1.02–2.00), 1.92 (95%CI = 1.09–3.37), and 2.88 (95%CI = 1.10–7.54) times higher odds for sarcopenia, respectively. Disability (mediated percentage 18.0%), sedentary behavior (12.9%), and low mobility (56.1%) were significant mediators in the association between increasing levels of pain and sarcopenia. Conclusions Higher levels of pain were associated with higher odds for sarcopenia among adults aged ≥65 years in 6 LMICs. Disability, sedentary behavior, and mobility problems were identified as potential mediators.

The thermal diffusivity of the resulting nanocomposites reaches 8.5 mm2 s–1, 50 times greater than blank poly(vinyl alcohol) and twice that of nanocomposites containing nonplasma treated boron nitride nanosheets. From TEM analysis, we observe much less aggregation of the nanosheets after plasma processing along with indications of an amorphous carbon interfacial layer, which may contribute to stable dispersion of boron nitride nanosheets in the resulting plasma treated colloids.","AI","Ulster University"

Therefore, we investigated this relationship in a large predominantly nationally representative sample from 47 LMICs. Methods: Cross sectional data from the World Health Survey were analyzed. Anxiety symptoms referred to severe or extreme problems with worries or anxiety in the past 30 days. Information on caregiving in the past 12 months was obtained. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education, household size, employment, disability, and country was conducted. Data on 237,952 individuals aged ≥18 years [mean (SD) age 38.4 (16.0) years; 50.8% female] were analyzed. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, caregiving was positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.52; 95%CI = 1.40, 1.65). Greater number of caregiving activities was associated with higher odds for anxiety symptoms dose-dependently, with the OR (95%CI) for engagement in 5 activities (vs. no caregiving) being 2.19 (1.86–2.58). Conclusion: Caregiving is associated with higher odds for anxiety symptoms among adults in LMICs. Given the increasing importance of informal caregivers in long-term care provision and the fact that good health of caregivers is vital to sustain this system, interventions to address mental health of caregivers in LMICs are urgently needed.","AI","Ulster University"

To develop AI systems, many principles (human rights, well-being, data agency, effectiveness, transparency, accountability, awareness of misuse and competence) must be considered to ensure that the AI is trustworthy and applicable. The current computerised ECG interpretation algorithms can detect different types of heart diseases. However, there are some challenges and shortcomings that need to be addressed, such as the explainability issue and the interaction between the human and the AI for clinical decision making. These challeng-es create opportunities to develop a trustworthy XAI for automated ECG interpretation with a high performance and a high confidence level. This study reports a proposed XAI interface design in automatic ECG interpreta-tion based on suggestions from previous studies and based on standard guidelines that were developed by the human computer interaction (HCI) community. New XAI interfaces should be developed in the future that fa-cilitate more transparency of the decision logic of the algorithm which may allow users to calibrate their trust and use of the AI system.","AI","Ulster University"

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between BNP and workplace absenteeism and potential mediating variables in a large sample of the US population. Nationally representative data collected in 2019 from the RAND American Life Panel (ALP) were used for this retrospective study. Workplace absenteeism was defined as the number of days of absence in the past 12 months for health-related reasons (count variable), while BNP corresponded to the presence of back pain due to spinal stenosis, back pain due to other causes, or neck pain (dichotomous variable). Control variables included sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, education, occupation, annual family income, health insurance, obesity, and diabetes. There were eight influential variables (depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, alcohol dependence, opioid dependence, walking difficulty, standing difficulty, and sitting difficulty). The association between BNP and workplace absenteeism was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model. There were 1,471 adults aged 22-83 years included in this study (52.9% of men; mean [standard deviation] age 44.5 [13.0] years). After adjusting for control variables, BNP was positively and significantly associated with workplace absenteeism (incidence rate ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.83). Walking, standing, and sitting difficulties individually explained between 24 and 43% of this association. Workplace interventions focusing on the management of BNP and overcoming difficulties in walking, standing, and sitting, potentially utilizing exercise, therapy, and ergonomic interventions, may prevent absenteeism.

Future studies should assess whether addressing factors such as pain, anxiety, depression, and stress in people with multimorbidity can lead to improvement in sleep in this population.","AI","Ulster University"
"Social participation and mild cognitive impairment in low- and middle-income countries","https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/social-participation-and-mild-cognitive-impairment-in-low-and-mid","Smith, L.; Shin, J.

T.; Carmichael, C.; Tully, M.; Koyanagi, A.","Nov 2022","Social participation may theoretically decrease risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, to date, no study has specifically investigated the association between social participation and MCI in LMICs, while the mediating role of loneliness is unknown. Thus, we investigated this association in a sample of adults aged ≥50 years from six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa) using nationally representative datasets. We analyzed cross-sectional, community-based data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. A social participation score (range 0–10 with higher scores corresponding to greater levels of social participation) was created based on nine questions about involvement in community activities in the last 12 months. The National Institute on Ageing-Alzheimer's Association criteria were used to define MCI. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis was performed. The analytical sample consisted of 32,715 individuals aged ≥50 years with preserved functional abilities [mean (SD) age 62.1 (15.6) years; 51.7% females]. In the overall sample, after adjustment for potential confounders, a one-unit increase in the social participation score was associated with a 13% decrease in odds for MCI (OR = 0.87; 95%CI = 0.82–0.93). Loneliness only explained 3.0% of the association. Greater levels of social participation were associated with a reduced odds for MCI, and this was not largely explained by loneliness. It may be prudent to implement interventions in LMICs to increase levels of social participation to aid in the prevention of MCI and ultimately dementia.","AI","Ulster University"

I.; Koyanagi, A.","21 Feb 2023","Little is known about the relationship between food insecurity and sleep problems in low- and middle-income countries, while the mediators of this association are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association between food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms in six low- and middle-income countries (i.e., China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa), and the potential mediators of this relationship. Cross-sectional, nationally representative data from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (2007–2010) were analysed. Past 12-month food insecurity was assessed with two questions on the frequency of eating less, and on hunger owing to a lack of food. Insomnia-related symptoms referred to severe or extreme sleep problems in the past 30 days. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis were conducted. Data on 42,489 adults aged ≥18 years were analysed (mean [standard deviation] age 43.8 [14.4] years; 50.1% females). The prevalence of any food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms was 11.9% and 4.4%, respectively. After adjustment, compared with no food insecurity, moderate (odds ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval = 1.11–2.10) and severe food insecurity (odds ratio = 2.35, 95% confidence interval = 1.56–3.55) were significantly associated with insomnia-related symptoms. Anxiety, perceived stress, and depression mediated 27.7%, 13.5%, and 12.5% of the relationship between any food insecurity and insomnia-related symptoms, respectively (total percentage = 43.3%). Food insecurity was positively associated with insomnia-related symptoms in adults from six low- and middle-income countries. Anxiety, perceived stress, and depression explained a substantial proportion of this relationship. Addressing food insecurity itself or the identified potential mediators among people with food insecurity may lead to a reduction in sleep problems among adults in low- and middle-income countries, pending confirmation with longitudinal studies.","AI","Ulster University"

Obese diabetic mice received daily injections of vehicle or RU486 over 28 days. Food intake, body weight, and plasma glucose were measured frequently. At 28 days, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and plasma triglycerides were assessed. Epididymal white adipose tissue and liver were excised for measurement of gene expression.

A.; Koyanagi, A.","31 Dec 2023","PURPOSE: To date, no study has investigated the association between food insecurity and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC). Thus, the aims of the present study were to examine this association among older adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and to identify the potential mediators in this association, given the importance of SCC in dementia risk among older people, and the projected particularly large increase in dementia in this setting.METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based, nationally representative data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) collected between 2007 and 2010 were analyzed. Two questions on subjective memory and learning complaints in the past 30 days were used to create a SCC scale ranging from 0 (No SCC) to 100 (worse SCC). Past 12 month food insecurity was assessed with two questions on frequency of eating less and hunger due to lack of food. Multivariable linear regression and mediation (Karlson-Holm-Breen method) analyses were conducted to assess associations.RESULTS: Data on 14,585 individuals aged ≥ 65 years [mean (SD) age 72.6 (11.5) years; 55.0% females] were analyzed. Severe food insecurity (vs. no food insecurity) was associated with 9.16 (95% CI = 6.95-11.37) points higher mean SCC score. Sleep/energy (mediated% 37.9%; P < 0.001), perceived stress (37.2%; P = 0.001), and depression (13.7%; P = 0.008) partially explained the association between severe food insecurity and SCC.CONCLUSION: Food insecurity was associated with SCC among older adults in LMICs. Future studies should assess whether addressing food insecurity among older adults in LMICs can improve cognitive health.","AI","Ulster University"
