"Ancient DNA evidence for the ecological globalization of cod fishing in medieval and post-medieval Europe.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193255/","Martínez-García, Lourdes; Ferrari, Giada; Cuevas, Angélica","September 2022","Understanding the historical emergence and growth of long-range fisheries can provide fundamental insights into the timing of ecological impacts and the development of coastal communities during the last millennium. Whole-genome sequencing approaches can improve such understanding by determining the origin of archaeological fish specimens that may have been obtained from historic trade or distant water. Here, we used genome-wide data to individually infer the biological source of 37 ancient Atlantic cod specimens (ca 1050-1950 CE) from England and Spain. Our findings provide novel genetic evidence that eleventh- to twelfth-century specimens from London were predominantly obtained from nearby populations, while thirteenth- to fourteenth-century specimens were derived from distant sources. Our results further suggest that Icelandic cod was indeed exported to London earlier than previously reported. Our observations confirm the chronology and geography of the trans-Atlantic cod trade from Newfoundland to Spain starting by the early sixteenth century. Our findings demonstrate the utility of whole-genome sequencing and ancient DNA approaches to describe the globalization of marine fisheries and increase our understanding regarding the extent of the North Atlantic fish trade and long-range fisheries in medieval and early modern times.","Marine","University of York"
"Combined sensitivity analysis for multiple failure modes.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/207123/","Yang, Jiannan; Clot, Arnau; Langley, Robin S.","April 2022","Sensitivity analysis identifies the influential parameters and it is a key step in the design process. Focusing on reliability based design, the probability of a failure mode and its sensitivity to input uncertainties are obtained in a single Monte Carlo simulation using the Likelihood Ratio method. For correlated multiple failure modes, a sensitivity matrix is proposed. The dominant singular vectors of the sensitivity matrix are found to indicate the most important parameters for combined sensitivity of multiple failure modes. Therefore, the sensitivity matrix can guide resources allocation so that most uncertainties can be reduced for system reliabilities.","Marine","University of York"
"The nature and extent of evidence on methodologies for monitoring and evaluating marine spatial management measures in the UK and similar coastal waters : a systematic map.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/176484/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Copping, Joshua; Mukherjee, Nibedita","May 2021","Background Anthropogenic degradation of marine ecosystems is widely accepted as a major social-ecological problem. The growing urgency to manage marine ecosystems more effectively has led to increasing application of spatial management measures (marine protected areas [MPAs], sectoral [e.g. fishery] closures and marine spatial planning [marine plans]). Understanding the methodologies used to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures against social, economic, and ecological outcomes is key for designing effective monitoring and evaluation programmes. Methods We used a pre-defined and tested search string focusing on intervention and outcome terms to search for relevant studies across four bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, 39 organisational websites, and one specialist data repository. Searches were conducted in English and restricted to the period 2009 to 2019 to align with current UK marine policy contexts. Relevant studies were restricted to UK-relevant coastal countries, as identified by key stakeholders. Search results were screened for relevance against pre-defined eligibility criteria first at title and abstract level, and then at full text. Articles assessed as not relevant at full text were recorded with reasons for exclusion. Two systematic map databases of meta-data and coded data from relevant primary and secondary studies, respectively, were produced. Review findings Over 19,500 search results were identified, resulting in 391 relevant primary articles, 33 secondary articles and 49 tertiary reviews. Relevant primary articles evaluated spatial management measures across a total of 22 social, economic and ecological outcomes; only 2.8% considered all three disciplines, with most focused exclusively on ecological (67.8%) or social (13.3%) evaluations. Secondary articles predominately focused on ecological evaluations (75.8%). The majority of the primary and secondary evidence base aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MPAs (85.7% and 90.9% respectively), followed by fisheries closures (12.5%; 3.0%) with only 1.8% of primary, and 6.1% of secondary, articles focused on marine plans or on MPAs and fisheries closures combined. Most evaluations reported within primary articles were conducted for a single site (60.4%) or multiple individual sites (32.5%), with few evaluating networks of sites (6.9%). Secondary articles mostly evaluated multiple individual sites (93.9%). Most (70.3%) primary articles conducted principal evaluations, i.e. basic description of effects; 29.4% explored causation; and 0.3% undertook benefit evaluations. Secondary articles predominately explored causation (66.7%) with the remainder conducting principal evaluations. Australia (27.4%), the USA (18.4%) and the UK (11.3%) were most frequently studied by primary articles, with secondary articles reporting mostly global (66.7%) or European (18.2%) syntheses. Conclusions The systematic map reveals substantial bodies of evidence relating to methods of evaluating MPAs against ecological outcomes. However, key knowledge gaps include evaluation across social and economic outcomes and of overall merit and/or worth (benefit evaluation), as well as of: marine plans; networks of sites; real-time, temporary or seasonal closures; spatial management within offshore waters, and lagoon or estuary environments. Although the evidence base has grown over the past two decades, information to develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks remains insufficient. Greater understanding on how to evaluate the effectiveness of spatial management measures is required to support improved management of global ocean resources and spaces.","Marine","University of York"

"A drowned Mesolithic shell midden complex at Hjarnø Vesterhoved,Denmark and its wider significance.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/172405/","Moe Astrup, Peter; Benjamin, Jonathan; Stankiewicz, Francis","February 2021","Anthropogenic shell accumulations (shell middens), often of great size, occur in their tens of thousands around the world’s coastlines. They mostly date from the Mid-Holocene onwards and are frequently taken as symptomatic of a Postglacial ‘revolution’ involving world-wide population growth and intensification in exploitation of marine resources. However, the comparative rarity of earlier deposits may have as much to do with Postglacial sea-level rise and the loss of evidence from earlier palaeoshorelines as with genuine socio-economic trends. Here we investigate the underwater Mesolithic (Ertebølle) shellmidden of Hjarnø Vesterhoved in Denmark, one of the first underwater shell middens to be systematically verified as an anthropogenic shell deposit in a region world-famous for its many hundreds of Ertebølle shell mounds on the present shoreline. We show how a combination of geophysical survey, coring, excavation, stratigraphic interpretation and macroscopic analysis of midden contents can be used to identify underwater deposits, to unravel their taphonomic and post-depositional history in relation to surrounding sediments, and to distinguish between cultural and natural agencies of shell accumulation and deformation. We demonstrate the presence of an intact underwater shell-midden deposit dated at 5400–5100 cal BC, one of the earliest in Denmark. We demonstrate the usefulness of such material in giving new information about early coastal subsistence economies and greater precision to the measurement of palaeosea levels. We discuss the implications of our results for an improved understanding of the Mesolithic record in Denmark and of biases in the archaeological record of Late Pleistocene and Early-to-Mid-Holocene coastal contexts. We emphasise the importance of researching more fully the geomorphological and taphonomic processes that affect the accumulation, destruction, burial, preservation and visibility of underwater archaeological deposits, the need to extend underwater investigations more widely and to more deeply submerged palaeoshorelines, and the combination of methods required to advance such investigations.","Marine","University of York"
"Characteristics of shallow and mesophotic environments of the Pemba Channel, Tanzania : implications for management and conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/168877/","Edeye, Kennedy Osuka; McClean, Colin John; Stewart, Bryce Donald","November 2020","Information on the spatial distribution of habitats and vulnerable species is important for conservation planning. In particular, detailed knowledge on connectivity of marine ecosystems in relation to depth and seafloor characteristics is crucial for any proposed conservation and management actions. Yet, the bulk of the seafloor remains undersampled, unstudied and unmapped, thereby limiting our understanding of connections between shallow and deep-water communities. Recent studies on mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) have highlighted the western Indian Ocean as a particularly understudied marine region. Here we utilise an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect in-situ temperature, oxygen concentration, bathymetry, acoustic backscatter and photographic data on benthic communities from shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30-150 m) depths at selected sites in the Greater Pemba Channel, Tanzania . Further, we use generalised additive models (GAMs) to determine useful predictors of substratum (hard and sand) and benthic community type (coral, turf algae, fleshy algae, fish). Our results revealed the presence of a complex seafloor characterised by pockmarks, steep slopes, submarine walls, and large boulders. Photographs confirmed the presence of MCE composed of corals, algae and fishes on the eastern margins of the Pemba Channel. The GAMs on the presence and absence of benthic community explained 35% to 91% of the deviance in fish and fleshy algae assemblages, respectively. Key predictors of the distribution of hard substrata and the coral reef communities were depth, showing the upper boundary of MCEs present at 30-40 m, and seafloor slope that showed more occurrences on steep slopes. The upper 100 m of water column had stable temperatures (25-26°C) and oxygen concentrations (220- 235 μmol/l). We noted the presence of submarine walls, steeply inclined bedrock, which appeared to support a highly bio-diverse community that may be worthy of particular conservation measures. Our results also highlight the capability of using marine robotics, particularly autonomous vehicles, to fill the knowledge gap for areas not readily accessible with surface vessels, and their potential application in the initial survey and subsequent monitoring of Marine Protected Areas.","Marine","University of York"
"Age-estimate evidence for a complex Middle to Late Pleistocene fluvial terrace aggradation spanning more than a 100-kyr interglacial–glacial cycle at Sutton Cross, eastern England.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/165436/","Langford, H. E.; Griffiths, H.; Horne, D. J.","September 2020","At Sutton Cross, eastern England, an undated River Nene 2nd Terrace was known to record a complex sequence of late Middle to Upper Pleistocene deposits. Amino acid geochronology was carried out for samples from four separate facies associations in order to provide a chronostratigraphic framework for this complex deposit. Each sample comprised three specimens of Bithynia tentaculata opercula. The intracrystalline protein decomposition results confirmed the sedimentary stratigraphic interpretation previously proposed for the site, i.e., that fossiliferous sediments yielding fully temperate Mollusca and Ostracoda faunas are equivalent in age to marine isotope stage (MIS) 7. Palaeotemperature reconstructions based on the Ostracoda fauna (July: +14 to +26 °C; January: ―4 to +5/+3 °C) embrace those of today at this location (July: +17 °C; January +3 °C). The sedimentary succession at Sutton Cross comprises vertically aggraded packages with a probable maximum age of MIS 8 and minimum age of MIS 2. This aggradation pattern (and age range) is also common to downstream sedimentary successions at Whittlesey, and is counterintuitive to the traditional terrace stratigraphy approach that expects laterally aggrading downstepping packages. The preservation of sediments of MIS 7 age and older at Sutton Cross with no evidence of glacial overriding places constraints on recently proposed late Middle Pleistocene regional ice limits.","Marine","University of York"
"The Effects of Aquaculture and Marine Conservation on Cultural Ecosystem Services : An Integrated Hedonic – Eudaemonic Approach.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/175181/","Spanou, Elisavet; Kenter, Jasper O.; Graziano, Marcello","June 2020","Understanding the cultural contributions of ecosystems is essential for recognising how environmental policy impacts on human well-being. We developed an integrated cultural ecosystem services (CES) valuation approach involving non-monetary valuation through a eudaemonic well-being questionnaire and monetary valuation through hedonic pricing. This approach was applied to assess CES values on the west coast of Scotland. The impact of scenic area and marine protected area (MPA) designations on CES values and potential trade-offs with aquaculture, an increasingly important provisioning ecosystem service in the region, were investigated. Results confirmed a eudaemonic well-being value structure of seven factors: engagement and interaction with nature, place identity, therapeutic value, spiritual value, social bonds, memory/transformative value, and challenge and skill. Visibility of, but not proximity to aquaculture negatively influenced housing prices. In contrast, proximity to MPAs and visibility of scenic areas increased property values. All eudaemonic well-being value factors were positively and significantly associated with scenic areas and a subset of these with MPAs. The integration of the two methods can provide decision-makers with a more comprehensive picture of CES values, their relation to conservation policies and interactions and trade-offs with other activities and services.","Marine","University of York"
"Integrating stakeholder knowledge through modular cooperative participatory processes for marine spatial planning outcomes (CORPORATES).","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/191740/","Slater, Anne Michelle; Irvine, Katherine N.; Byg, Anja A.","May 2020","Management of the sea is increasingly complex, riddled with uncertainty and necessitates involvement from researchers across disciplines and stakeholders from multiple policy and practice sectors. This article discusses “The Cooperative Participatory Evaluation of Renewable Technologies on Ecosystem Services” (CORPORATES) research project, which developed an innovative and practical method of linking ecological processes, ecosystem services and benefits. The research was conducted in the context of licensing decisions for offshore wind farms in the North Sea (Scotland, UK). A set of linked, modular participatory processes were developed to foster cross-sector stakeholder engagement. It employed an exchange of ecological, legal, social, economic and cultural knowledge around marine ecosystem services. Workshop exercises included participatory mapping, benefit identification, and developing an understanding of linkages between ecosystem services, benefits, stakeholders’ activities and policy drivers through co-development of conceptual systems maps of the study area. The participatory exercises fostered meaningful dialogue across sectors and an ability to participate equally, despite initial differences in knowledge about ecosystem services. The development of conceptual systems maps facilitated productive discussion about trade-offs in relation to different policies. Reflective discussion identifies ways in which the developed processes could be integrated into future decision making. An assessment of the approach revealed that it operationalised a post normal science framework in terms of process oversight, multiple knowledge claims, and managing uncertainty. It developed a process that linked understanding of ecosystem functioning with the creation and implementation of policy thereby creating an ecosystem approach to marine spatial planning and licensing decisions, as required by law. This approach has extensive transferability to situations where stakeholder engagement is required to develop policy and provide feedback as part of a decision-making process. It is an engagement, outreach tool for communities and can help teach methods and processes for stakeholder engagement which enable new insights.","Marine","University of York"
"Emerging themes to support ambitious UK marine biodiversity conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158671/","Rees, Sian E.; Sheehan, Emma V.; Stewart, Bryce Donald","February 2020","Healthy marine ecosystems provide a wide range of resources and services that support life on Earth and contribute to human wellbeing. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are accepted as an important tool for the restoration and maintenance of marine ecosystem structure, function, health and ecosystem integrity through the conservation of significant species, habitats, or entire ecosystems. In recent years there has been a rapid expansion in the area of ocean designated as an MPA. Despite this progress in spatial protection targets and the progressive knowledge of the essential interdependence between the human and the ocean system, marine biodiversity continues to decline, placing in jeopardy the range of ecosystem services benefits humans rely on. There is a need to address this shortcoming. Ambitious marine conservation: • Requires a shift from managing individual marine features within MPAs to whole-sites to enable repair and renewal of marine systems; • Reflects an ambition for sustainable livelihoods by fully integrating fisheries management with conservation (Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management) as the two are critically interdependent; • Establishes a world class and cost effective ecological and socio-economic monitoring and evaluation framework that includes the use of controls and sentinel sites to improve sustainability in marine management; and • Challenges policy makers and practitioners to be progressive by integrating MPAs into the wider seascape as critical functional components rather than a competing interest and move beyond MPAs as the only tool to underpin the benefits derived from marine ecosystems by identifying other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) to establish synergies with wider governance frameworks.","Marine","University of York"
"Options for managing human threats to high seas biodiversity.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/156565/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Hoppit, George; Townley, Adam","January 2020","Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) constitute 61% of the world’s oceans and are collectively managed by countries under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Growing concern regarding the deteriorating state of the oceans and ineffective management of ABNJ has resulted in negotiations to develop an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction under UNCLOS. To inform these negotiations, we identified existing and emerging human activities and influences that affect ABNJ and evaluated management options available to mitigate the most pervasive, with highest potential for impact and probability of emergence. The highest-ranking activities and influences that affect ABNJ were fishing/hunting, maritime shipping, climate change and its associated effects, land-based pollution and mineral exploitation. Management options are diverse and available through a variety of actors, although their actions are not always effective. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs), were the only consistently effective option to mitigate impacts across high-ranked activities and influences. However, addressing land-based pollution will require national action to prevent this at its source, and MPAs offer only a partial solution for climate change. A new ABNJ ILBI could help unify management options and actors to conserve marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable use. Incorporating a mechanism to establish effective ABMTs into the ILBI will help deliver multiple objectives based on the ecosystem approach.","Marine","University of York"
"Effects of Sea Salt Aerosol Emissions for Marine Cloud Brightening on Atmospheric Chemistry : Implications for Radiative Forcing.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/156250/","Horowitz, Hannah M.; Holmes, Christopher; Wright, Alicia","January 2020","Marine cloud brightening (MCB) is proposed to offset global warming by emitting sea salt aerosols to the tropical marine boundary layer, which increases aerosol and cloud albedo. Sea salt aerosol is the main source of tropospheric reactive chlorine (Cly) and bromine (Bry). The effects of additional sea salt on atmospheric chemistry have not been explored. We simulate sea salt aerosol injections for MCB under two scenarios (212–569 Tg/a) in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model, only considering their impacts as a halogen source. Globally, tropospheric Cly and Bry increase (20–40%), leading to decreased ozone (−3 to −6%). Consequently, OH decreases (−3 to −5%), which increases the methane lifetime (3–6%). Our results suggest that the chemistry of the additional sea salt leads to minor total radiative forcing compared to that of the sea salt aerosol itself (~2%) but may have potential implications for surface ozone pollution in tropical coastal regions.","Marine","University of York"
"Marine Conservation Begins at Home : How a Local Community and Protection of a Small Bay Sent Waves of Change Around the UK and Beyond.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/158673/","Stewart, Bryce Donald; Howarth, Leigh Michael; Wood, Howard L.","January 2020","The Firth of Clyde, on the west coast of Scotland, was once one of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. However, successive decades of poor management and overfishing led to a dramatic loss of biodiversity and the collapse of finfish fisheries. In response, concerned local residents on the Isle of Arran, which lies in the middle of the Clyde, formed the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) in 1995. After 13 years of campaigning, a small (2.67 km2) area in Lamlash Bay became Scotland’s first no-take zone (NTZ) in 2008, and only the second in the UK. Since protection, biodiversity has increased substantially, along with the size, age and density of commercially important species such as the king scallop, Pecten maximus, and the European lobster, Homarus gammarus. Arguably more important, however, is the influence the Lamlash Bay NTZ and COAST have had on UK marine protection in general. Most notably, detailed research has created a case study that clearly demonstrates the benefits of protection in an area where little such evidence is available. This case has been used repeatedly to support efforts for increased protection of UK waters to help rebuild marine ecosystems and enhance their resilience in an uncertain future. In Scotland specifically, lobbying by COAST led to the designation of a much larger marine protected area (MPA, >250 km2) around the south of Arran, one of 30 new MPAs in the country. Evidence from Lamlash Bay has supported development of strong protection for these MPAs, seeing off lobbyist efforts to weaken management. Arran’s conservation success has been recognized internationally and is inspiring greater involvement of local communities around the UK, and further afield, to take the destiny of their coastal waters into their own hands. Successful marine conservation begins at home.","Marine","University of York"
"What is the nature and extent of evidence on methodologies for monitoring and evaluating marine spatial management measures in UK and similar coastal waters? A systematic map protocol.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/154166/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Stewart, Bryce Donald; McKinley, Emma","October 2019","Background Anthropogenic degradation of marine ecosystems is widely accepted as a major social-ecological problem. The growing urgency to better manage marine ecosystems has led to the increasing application of ‘spatial management measures’ including marine protected areas, sectoral (e.g. fishery) closures, and marine spatial planning. However, the designation of varied spatial management regimes is just the first step; achievement of objectives relies upon effective implementation, monitoring, evaluation and adaptation. Despite spatial management being a core component of the marine management portfolio, to our knowledge, there is no systematic overview of the evidence on methodologies available, and employed, to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness across social, economic and ecological outcomes. Methods This systematic map will examine existing evidence describing methodologies for monitoring the effects, and evaluating the effectiveness, of marine spatial management across ecological, social and economic outcomes. Our aim is to provide a resource for decision-makers, primarily in the UK but also internationally, that supports effective marine management, and to describe the current evidence base. Identification and evaluation of relevant studies will therefore be restricted to coastal countries identified by our Stakeholder Group as being relevant to the UK, and searches will be restricted to the period 2009 to 2019 to align with the current UK policy context. Searches for relevant grey and academic literature, published in English, will be conducted in four bibliographic search engines, Google Scholar, 38 organisational websites and one specialist data repository. Eligibility screening will be conducted first at title and abstract level, and then at full text. Coding and meta-data extraction from eligible studies will include: bibliographic information, general information about the spatial management measure studied, and methodological information on the monitoring and evaluation undertaken. Consistency checking amongst reviewers will be undertaken during screening, coding and data extraction phases. The outcome of the systematic map will be a database that displays the meta-data of identified relevant studies. Findings will be presented in a descriptive report detailing the evaluation approaches and analytical methodologies employed, and data collection methods applied and/or data required by relevant studies to inform evaluations on the effectiveness of marine spatial management measures.","Marine","University of York"
"A fulfilled human life : Eliciting sense of place and cultural identity in two UK marine environments through the Community Voice Method.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150123/","Ainsworth, Gillian B.; Kenter, Jasper O.; O'Connor, Sebastian","August 2019","Human impacts on the marine environment threaten the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people. Marine environments are a common-pool resource (CPR) and one of their major management challenges is how to incorporate the value of ecosystem services to society in decision-making. Cultural ecosystem services (CES) relate to the often intangible benefits people receive from their interactions with the natural environment and contribute to individual and collective human wellbeing. Priority knowledge gaps include the need to better understand shared values regarding CES, and how to effectively integrate these values into decision-making. We filmed 40 Community Voice Method interviews with marine stakeholders in two areas of the UK to improve on the valuation of coastal and marine CES. Results show that cultural benefits including sense of place, aesthetic pleasure and cultural identity were bi-directional, contributed directly to a ‘fulfilled human life’ and were associated with charismatic marine life and biodiversity. Other-regarding self-transcendence values were salient underscoring a desire for sustainable marine management. We critically reflect on our analytical framework that integrates aspects of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment and IPBES conceptual frameworks. The thematic codebook developed for this study could prove useful for future comparative studies in other marine CES contexts. We propose that values-led management could increase the efficacy of marine planning strategies.","Marine","University of York"
"Understanding Iodine Chemistry Over the Northern and Equatorial Indian Ocean.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/150493/","Mahajan, Anoop S.; Tinel, Liselotte; Sarkar, Amit","February 2019","Observations of halogen oxides, ozone, meteorological parameters, and physical and biogeochemical water column measurements were made in the Indian Ocean and its marine boundary layer as a part of the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2). The expedition took place on board the oceanographic research vessel Sagar Nidhi during 4–22 December 2015 from Goa, India, to Port Louis, Mauritius. Observations of mixed layer depth, averaged temperature, salinity, and nitrate concentrations were used to calculate predicted iodide concentrations in the seawater. The inorganic iodine ocean-atmosphere flux (hypoiodous acid [HOI] and molecular iodine [I2]) was computed using the predicted iodide concentrations, measured atmospheric ozone, and wind speed. Iodine oxide (IO) mixing ratios peaked at 0.47 ± 0.29 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) in the remote open ocean environment. The estimated iodide concentrations and HOI and I2 fluxes peaked at 200/500 nM, 410/680 nmol·m−2·day−1, and 20/80 nmol·m−2·day−1, respectively, depending on the parameterization used. The calculated fluxes for HOI and I2 were higher closer to the Indian subcontinent; however, atmospheric IO was only observed above the detection limit in the remote open ocean environment. We use NO2 observations to show that titration of IO by NO2 is the main reason for this result. These observations show that inorganic iodine fluxes and atmospheric IO show similar trends in the Indian Ocean marine boundary layer, but the impact of inorganic iodine emissions on iodine chemistry is buffered in elevated NOx environments, even though the estimated oceanic iodine fluxes are higher.","Marine","University of York"
"Elemental Problems, Methodical Solutions : Expertise, Ecology and Entertainment in the Study of Marine Mammals.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147390/","Rees, Amanda","June 2019","This paper examines the development of socio-technical strategies and practices that have been developed, by both experts and laypeople, to study and to display the socio-ecology of marine mammals. The late 1950s saw the emergence of a distinctively different approach to the understanding of animal behaviour and biology – one that focused on the observation and (sometimes) manipulation of animals as they lived under natural conditions. In the first instance, it was applied to land animals, birds and insects in Europe, America and the territories that either were, or had been, under colonial control. By the early 21st century, however, many wild-living colonies of whales, dolphins and seals were being studied by researchers, and many of them – as with terrestrial animals – were not just known individually, but could be placed on a generations-deep family tree. This paper will explore how this transition was managed. It will show how it was possible for scientists to study live animal behaviour in an element inimical to human survival, and how researchers borrowed key methodological practices from other human activities in order to access their research subjects. It will show how these socio-technical developments intersected with the efforts to display marine mammals on land and above all, it will demonstrate the ways in which the agency of the animals under observation had an essential role to play in the emergence of cetology as a profession and as a form of knowledge.","Marine","University of York"

This review identifies the minor, intermediate and major impediments (respectively defined as ‘bottlenecks, showstoppers and train-wrecks’) to marine management, resulting from a 4-year analysis of national, regional and European reports. Most of the problems are linked to the resistance of countries to collaborate and to the inability to integrate the work already carried out under other pieces of legislation. The European countries will need to better integrate and coordinate their actions in marine management in the second cycle of the MSFD, in order to achieve its final goal of Good Environmental Status as well as the objectives of other environmental policies.","Marine","University of York"

In this study, a single-step microwave process was used to depolymerise a range of macroalgae native to the United Kingdom, producing a growth medium suitable for microbial fermentation. The medium contained a range of mono- and polysaccharides as well as macro- and micronutrients that could be metabolised by the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Among twelve macroalgae species, the brown seaweeds exhibited the highest fermentation potential, especially the kelp Saccharina latissima. Applying a portfolio of ten native M. pulcherrima strains, yeast growth kinetics, as well as production of lipids and 2-phenylethanol were examined, with productivity and growth rate being strain dependent. On the 2 L scale, 6.9 g L−1 yeast biomass – a yield of 0.14 g g−1 with respect to the supplied macroalgae – containing 37.2% (w/w) lipid was achieved through utilisation of the proteins, mono- and polysaccharides from S. latissima, with no additional enzymes. In addition, the yeast degraded a range of fermentation inhibitors released upon microwave processing at high temperatures and long holding times. As macroalgae can be cultured to food grade, this system offers a novel, potentially low-cost route to edible microbial oils as well as a renewable feedstock for oleochemicals.","Marine","University of York"
"The interplay between economics, legislative power and social influence examined through a social-ecological framework for marine ecosystems services.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137199/","Martino, Simone; Tett, Paul; Kenter, Jasper","September 2018","In the last 15 years, conservation has shifted increasingly towards perspectives based on the instrumental value of nature, where what counts is what provides benefits to humans. The ecosystem services framework embraces this vision of nature through monetary valuation of the environment to correct market failures and government distortions that hinder efficient allocation of public goods, including goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems. The popularity of this approach is reflected in different countries legislation; for instance, US, EU and UK have introduced economic criteria for comparing costs and benefits of environmental policies in protecting ecosystem services. From an operational perspective, the ecosystem services framework requires ecologists to estimate how the supply of services is affected by changes in the functionality and/or the extent of ecosystems; and economists to identify how changes in the supply affect the flow of direct and indirect benefits to people. However, this approach may be simplistic when faced with the complexity of social-ecological systems. We investigated this for three different marine services: assimilative capacity of waste, coastal defense and renewable energy. We find that economic valuation could provide efficient and fair allocations in the case of assimilative capacity, but leads to social clashes between outputs generated by cost benefit analysis and citizens’ expectation in the case of coastal defense. In the case of renewable energy, controversies can be generated by regulatory mechanisms that are not necessarily aligned with the interests of industry or important social groups. We conclude that there is a need to integrate perspectives arising from utilitarian allocation of resources with those involving legislation and communal values in order to reconcile conflicting interests and better sustain marine social-ecological systems.","Marine","University of York"
"Evidence gaps and biodiversity threats facing the marine environment of the United Kingdom’s Overseas Territories.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/139484/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Fieldhouse, Philip; McClean, Colin John","November 2018","Understanding the evidence base and identifying threats to the marine environment is critical to ensure cost-effective management and to identify priorities for future research. The United Kingdom (UK) government is responsible for approximately 2% of the world’s oceans, most of which belongs to its 14 Overseas Territories (UKOTs). Containing biodiversity of global significance, and far in excess of the UK mainland’s domestic species, there has recently been a strong desire from many of the UKOTs, the UK Government, and NGOs to improve marine management in these places. Implementing evidence-based marine policy is, however, challenged by the disparate nature of scientific research in the UKOTs and knowledge gaps about the threats they face. Here, we address these issues by systematically searching for scientific literature which has examined UKOT marine biodiversity and by exploring publicly available spatial threat data. We find that UKOT marine biodiversity has received consistent, but largely low, levels of scientific interest, and there is considerable geographical and subject bias in research effort. Of particular concern is the lack of research focus on management or threats to biodiversity. The extent and intensity of threats vary amongst and within the UKOTs but unsurprisingly, climate change associated threats affect them all and direct human stressors are more prevalent in those with higher human populations. To meet global goals for effective conservation and management, there is an urgent need for additional and continued investment in research and management in the Overseas Territories, particularly those that have been of lesser focus.","Marine","University of York"
"Measuring site fidelity and homesite-to-pre-spawning site connectivity of Bonefish (Albula vulpes): using mark-recapture to inform habitat conservation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/138204/","Boucek, R.E.; Lewis, Justin P.; Stewart, Bryce Donald","October 2018","Effective marine habitat protection requires life history information, including identification of connected adult habitats and spawning sites, and movement information throughout those areas. Here, we implemented a mark-recapture study in the Bahamas Archipelago to estimate patterns of site fidelity, and to determine what homesites are connected to pre-spawning sites of economically important Bonefish (Albula vulpes) across multiple islands. We captured over 7,000 Bonefish via seine netting, marked them with dart tags, and relied on fishing guides and anglers to report recaptures on Abaco, Grand Bahama, and Andros. Mark-recapture results from the three islands showed that 60-80% of Bonefish were recaptured within 5 km of their tagging site. Across the three islands, mean distance between mark and recapture was less than 11 km, suggesting space use that is tractable for effective marine reserve implementation. We also found that pre-spawning sites housed individuals from multiple homesites that were separated by distances up to 75 km. With these connections in mind, conserving Bonefish spawning biomass necessitates habitat protection in multiple home areas, along migratory corridors, and at pre-spawn and spawning locations. Our case study illustrates how mark-recapture of a C&R species can be used to identify habitats for protection. Information from this mark-recapture study contributed to the designation of six National Parks aimed at protecting habitats used by Bonefish, as well as other spatially overlapping species.","Marine","University of York"

IO was observed almost ubiquitously in the open ocean with larger mixing ratios south of the Polar Front (PF). Contrary to previous reports, IO was not positively correlated to sea surface temperature (SST)/salinity, or negatively to chlorophyll a. Over the whole expedition, SST showed a weak negative correlation with respect to IO while chl a was positively correlated. North of the PF, chl a showed a strong positive correlation with IO. The computed HOI and I2 fluxes do not show any significant correlation with atmospheric IO. Simulations with the global CAM-Chem model show a reasonably good agreement with observations north of the PF but the model fails to reproduce the elevated IO south of the PF indicating that the current emission parametrizations are not sufficient to explain iodine chemistry in the Southern Indian Ocean.","Marine","University of York"
"Structure and function of a glycoside hydrolase family 8 endoxylanase from Teredinibacter turnerae.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137106/","Fowler, Claire A; Hemsworth, Glyn R; Cuskin, Fiona","July 2018","The biological conversion of lignocellulosic matter into high-value chemicals or biofuels is of increasing industrial importance as the sector slowly transitions away from nonrenewable sources. Many industrial processes involve the use of cellulolytic enzyme cocktails - a selection of glycoside hydrolases and, increasingly, polysaccharide oxygenases - to break down recalcitrant plant polysaccharides. ORFs from the genome of Teredinibacter turnerae, a symbiont hosted within the gills of marine shipworms, were identified in order to search for enzymes with desirable traits. Here, a putative T. turnerae glycoside hydrolase from family 8, hereafter referred to as TtGH8, is analysed. The enzyme is shown to be active against β-1,4-xylan and mixed-linkage (β-1,3,β-1,4) marine xylan. Kinetic parameters, obtained using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and 3,5-dinitrosalicyclic acid reducing-sugar assays, show that TtGH8 catalyses the hydrolysis of β-1,4-xylohexaose with a k cat/K m of 7.5 × 10 7  M -1  min -1 but displays maximal activity against mixed-linkage polymeric xylans, hinting at a primary role in the degradation of marine polysaccharides. The three-dimensional structure of TtGH8 was solved in uncomplexed and xylobiose-, xylotriose- and xylohexaose-bound forms at approximately 1.5 Å resolution; the latter was consistent with the greater k cat/K m for hexasaccharide substrates. A 2,5B boat conformation observed in the -1 position of bound xylotriose is consistent with the proposed conformational itinerary for this class of enzyme. This work shows TtGH8 to be effective at the degradation of xylan-based substrates, notably marine xylan, further exemplifying the potential of T. turnerae for effective and diverse biomass degradation.","Marine","University of York"
"Ecological connectivity across ocean depths : implications for protected area design.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/134977/","O'Leary, Bethan Christine; Roberts, Callum Michael","August 2018","Coastal nations have embarked on a rapid program of marine protected area (MPA) establishment, incentivised by the approaching 2020 deadline of United Nations global marine protection targets. Alongside, efforts are underway to extend protection into areas beyond national jurisdiction through a new international legally binding instrument. These developments are welcome but there are risks that in meeting them, nations will still fail to supply adequate protection to marine life. An increasing number of MPAs protect the seabed while the water column remains open to fishing. This is because vulnerable habitats in need of protection are disproportionately perceived to be those on the seabed, while the water column is viewed as much less at risk. The seabed and water column are, however, inextricably linked. Transitions between human-defined vertical ocean zones are blurred, with animals and oceanographic features moving across depths. Here, we explore a rapidly growing literature on ecological and environmental connections through the water column, and between the water column and the seabed, to consider whether vertically stratified management is justified from an ecological standpoint. We find that emerging research increasingly links upper-ocean communities and processes to seabed ecology and biogeochemistry suggesting that exploitation of the water column is likely to have a significant and widely distributed footprint in the deep-sea. We conclude that there is a strong a priori case for surface to seabed protection within MPAs, and that this should be the default, precautionary approach to safeguard intact ecosystems with as near to natural function as possible.","Marine","University of York"
"Can national management measures achieve good status across international boundaries? : a case study of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast sub-region.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/129429/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Mike; Quintino, Victor","April 2018","Coastal countries have historically implemented management measures to improve the status of their national marine waters and little effort has been made to take coordinated actions to improve the status of the entire region or sub- region of which they are part. At the European level, the adoption of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to remedy this deficiency and to promote coordination among countries and an integrated management of the marine environment. The MSFD requires each country to propose and adopt a programme of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status of the regional seas. This study compares the programmes of measures of the three countries of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast sub-region – France, Portugal and Spain – presenting a novel use of multivariate analyses using semi-quantitative policy information. Among the four North-East Atlantic sub-regions, this study area was chosen because it showed the lowest levels of coherence during the first phase of the implementation of the MSFD, according to the European Commission assessment. The results show the differences among the three programmes, confirming the difficulties that neighbouring countries face when they are required to adopt common approaches in the implementation of this multi-sectoral Directive. Most of the measures developed in the sub-region address marine biodiversity but this is through a wide range of actions, covering different pressures and different species/habitats. The integration with other legislation is more similar between Spain and France and differs between these and Portugal. The three countries also recognise the lack of knowledge to perform the economic analysis, in particular in quantifying the costs of and social benefits derived from their measures. It is concluded here that a better use of the regional and European coordination structures is needed to fill the gaps in knowledge and to exchange good practices. More political will is necessary to take action at European and international level to mitigate the impact of those socio-economic activities through joint programmes, for which Community funding is available.","Marine","University of York"
"Does bathymetry drive coastal Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus) aggregations?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/131887/","Copping, Joshua; Stewart, Bryce Donald; McClean, Colin John","May 2018","Background The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is known to aggregate in a number of coastal locations globally, however what causes these aggregations to form where they do is largely unknown. This study examines whether bathymetry is an important driver of coastal aggregation locations for R. typus through bathymetry’s effect on primary productivity and prey availability. This is a global study taking into account all coastal areas within R. typus’ range. Methods R. typus aggregation locations were identified through an extensive literature review. Global bathymetric data were compared at R. typus aggregation locations and a large random selection of non-aggregation areas. Generalised linear models were used to assess which bathymetric characteristic had the biggest influence on aggregation presence. Results Aggregation sites were significantly shallower than non-aggregation sites and in closer proximity to deep water (the mesopelagic zone) by two orders of magnitude. Slope at aggregation sites was significantly steeper than non-aggregation sites. These three bathymetric variables were shown to have the biggest association with aggregation sites, with up to 88% of deviation explained by the GLMs. Discussion The three key bathymetric characteristics similar at the aggregation sites are known to induce upwelling events, increase primary productivity and consequently attract numerous other filter feeding species. The location of aggregation sites in these key areas can be attributed to this increased prey availability, thought to be the main reason R. typus aggregations occur, extensively outlined in the literature. The proximity of aggregations to shallow areas such as reefs could also be an important factor why whale sharks thermoregulate after deep dives to feed. These findings increase our understanding of whale shark behaviour and may help guide the identification and conservation of further aggregation sites.","Marine","University of York"
"Benefits and impediments for the integrated and coordinated management of European seas.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/125129/","Cavallo, Marianna; Elliott, Michael; Touza, Julia M.","September 2017","New multi-sectoral policies with a regional implementation are developed when maritime states recognise the importance of managing the marine environment under an ecosystem-perspective rather than a use-perspective. In Europe, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is the first attempt to promote an integrated management of the seas from the coastline to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone. This paper shows that, nine years from the MSFD adoption, there remain several ecological, economic, social and governance challenges. Using information gathered in a dedicated survey of the European Union Marine Strategy Coordination Group and in the recent literature the paper identifies the obstacles preventing a successful regional cooperation and policy integration. The survey indicates that the MSFD coordination structures are, in general, well-developed but there is an apparent lack of political will to coordinate actions at the regional level. Member States request greater flexibility to implement the Directive but they put their national interests before the benefit of a coherent and integrated approach for the entire region. Differences in budget, economic sector predominance, lack of staff and the MSFD short time-scale are identified as the factors that can hamper cooperation. These have produced recommendations of possible strategies for optimising regional coordination structures which respect the subsidiarity principle underpinning the MSFD.","Marine","University of York"
"The trade-off between tidal-turbine array yield and impact on flow: A multi-objective optimisation problem.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/119470/","du Feu, R.J.; Funke, S.W.; Kramer, S.C.","July 2017","Abstract This paper introduces a new approach for investigating trade-offs between different societal objectives in the design of tidal-turbine arrays. This method is demonstrated through the trade-off between the yield of an array, and the extent to which that array alters the flow. This is posed as a multi-objective optimisation problem, and the problem is investigated using the array layout optimisation tool OpenTidalFarm. Motivated by environmental concerns, OpenTidalFarm is adapted to not only maximise array yield but also to minimise the effect of the array upon the hydrodynamics of the region, specifically the flow velocity. A linear scalarisation of the multi-objective optimisation problem is solved for a series of different weightings of the two conflicting objectives. Two idealised test scenarios are evaluated and in each case a set of Pareto solutions is found. These arrays are assessed for the power they generate and the severity of change they cause in the flow velocity. These analyses allow for the identification of trade-offs between these two objectives, while the methods proposed can similarly be applied to the two key societal objectives of energy production and conservation, thus providing information that could be valuable to stakeholders and policymakers when making decisions on array design.","Marine","University of York"
"Particulate phases are key in controlling dissolved iron concentrations in the (sub)tropical North Atlantic.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/127894/","Milne, Angela; Schlosser, Christian; Wake, Bronwyn D.","February 2017","The supply and bioavailability of iron (Fe) controls primary productivity and N2 fixation in large parts of the global ocean. An important, yet poorly quantified, source to the ocean is particulate Fe (pFe). Here we present the first combined dataset of particulate, labile-particulate (L-pFe), and dissolved Fe (dFe) from the (sub)tropical North Atlantic. We show a strong relationship between L-pFe and dFe, indicating a dynamic equilibrium between these two phases whereby particles “buffer” dFe and maintain the elevated concentrations observed. Moreover, L-pFe can increase the overall “available” (L-pFe + dFe) Fe pool by up to 55%. The lateral shelf flux of this available Fe was similar in magnitude to observed soluble aerosol-Fe deposition, a comparison that has not been previously considered. These findings demonstrate that L-pFe is integral to Fe cycling and hence plays a role in regulating carbon cycling, warranting its inclusion in Fe budgets and biogeochemical models.","Marine","University of York"
"Trade-offs in marine protection : Multi-species interactions within a community-led temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/105519/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Dubois, Pascal; Gratton, Paul","August 2016","This study investigated the effects of a community-led temperate marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Firth of Clyde, Scotland, on commercially important populations of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), brown crab (Cancer pagurus), and velvet swimming crabs (Necora puber). Potting surveys conducted over 4 years revealed significantly higher catch per unit effort (cpue 109% greater), weight per unit effort (wpue 189% greater), and carapace length (10-15 mm greater) in lobsters within the reserve compared with control sites. However, likely due to low levels of recruitment and increased fishing effort outside the reserve, lobster catches decreased in all areas during the final 2 years. Nevertheless, catch rates remained higher within the reserve across all years, suggesting the reserve buffered these wider declines. Additionally, lobster cpue and wpue declined with increasing distance from the boundaries of the marine reserve, a trend which tag-recapture data suggested were due to spillover. Catches of berried lobster were also twice as high within the reserve than outside, and the mean potential reproductive output per female was 22.1% greater. It was originally thought that higher densities of lobster within the reserve might lead to greater levels of aggression and physical damage. However, damage levels were solely related to body size, as large lobsters >110 mm had sustained over 218% more damage than smaller individuals. Interestingly, catches of adult lobsters were inversely correlated with those of juvenile lobsters, brown crabs, and velvet crabs, which may be evidence of competitive displacement and/or predation. Our findings provide evidence that temperate marine reserves can deliver fisheries and conservation benefits, and highlight the importance of investigating multispecies interactions, as the recovery of some species can have knock-on effects on others.","Marine","University of York"

The integration of cultural ecosystem services (CES) into the ecosystem services framework remains a challenge due to the difficulties associated with defining, articulating and measuring CES. We operationalise a novel framework developed by the UK National Ecosystem Assessment that identifies CES as the interactions between environmental spaces (i.e. physical localities or landscapes), and the activities that occur there. We evaluate the benefits of the CES provided by 151 UK marine sites to recreational sea anglers and divers, using subjective well-being indicators. Factor analysis of an online questionnaire with 1220 participants revealed multiple CES benefits that contribute to human wellbeing e.g. including ‘engagement with nature’, ‘place identity’ and ‘therapeutic value’. In addition to regional differences, we also found that biophysical attributes of sites, such as the presence of charismatic species and species diversity, were positively associated with provision of CES benefits. The study provides evidence that could be used to inform designation of protected areas. The indicators used in the study may also be adapted for use across a range of marine and terrestrial spaces for improved integration of CES in environmental decision-making.","Marine","University of York"

In this paper we present the results of pollen analysis performed on cave hyena coprolites [Crocuta crocuta spelaea (Goldfuss, 1832)] from Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) sites of Cava Muracci (Cisterna di Latina, central Italy) and Tana delle Iene (Ceglie Messapica, southern Italy). This study provides new insights into the vegetation of the Late Pleistocene of peninsular Italy, until now known only through long pollen records. It also shows how the content of coprolites, combined with faunal data and geochronological investigations, can represent a potential integrative source of palaeoclimatic proxy data. Our results indicate that the surroundings of both of the hyena dens were characterised by a patchy landscape with open lowlands dominated by steppe and grassland vegetation, while a few mesophilous and thermophilous trees were present in more humid areas, probably along the marine coast and inland. The harsh glacial climate appears to have been milder at Cava Muracci than at Tana delle Iene. This could be due either to the different environmental features of the two sites or to the high climatic variability that occurred during MIS3.","Marine","University of York"

The conversion of dimethyl sulfide to sulfuric acid is the dominant source of oceanic secondary aerosol. Ocean emitted iodine can also produce aerosol. Using a GEOS-Chem model, we present a simulation of iodine aerosol. The simulation compares well with the limited observational data set. Iodine aerosol concentrations are highest in the tropical marine boundary layer (MBL) averaging 5.2 ng (I) m −3 with monthly maximum concentrations of 90 ng (I) m −3. These masses are small compared to sulfate (0.75% of MBL burden, up to 11% regionally) but are more significant compared to dimethyl sulfide sourced sulfate (3% of the MBL burden, up to 101% regionally). In the preindustrial, iodine aerosol makes up 0.88% of the MBL burden sulfate mass and regionally up to 21%. Iodine aerosol may be an important regional mechanism for ocean-atmosphere interaction.","Marine","University of York"

For the first time, ΔR values were reliably determined for these coastal waters, and also for the first time a ΔR was calculated for the Late Pleistocene in Atlantic Iberia. Pairs of coeval samples of different carbon reservoirs selected from Upper Paleolithic (Late Pleistocene) and Mesolithic (Early Holocene) contexts yielded ΔR weighted mean values of −117±70 14C yr and −105±21 14C yr, respectively. These values show oceanographic conditions characterized by a reduced offset between atmospheric and surface water 14C contents, suggesting a nonexistent or a very weak upwelling and some stratification of the water column. Similar oceanographic conditions have been recorded in other areas of Atlantic Iberia during the Holocene, such as off Andalusian and northwestern Galician coasts. Results not only provide useful information on environmental conditions but also a framework to obtain more precise and reliable absolute chronologies for the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene in northern Iberia.","Marine","University of York"

Coordination at international level is particularly important during the implementation of environmental policies aimed at reducing the widespread pressures derived from activities, such as shipping and fishing. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) aims to protect and improve the status of a wide range of ecosystem components with a regional focus, promoting cooperation among countries and integration with other environmental policies. In 2014, the European Commission assessed the level of adequacy, consistency and coherence achieved by Member States during the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD and hence this paper focuses on the cross-border coherence and coordination within one marine region in order to achieve the goals of the Directive. In particular, it identifies and analyses the main differences among the results of the implementation of the first phase of the MSFD across the North-East Atlantic region. This analysis shows that, in general, the use of existing data, methodologies and targets from related environmental policies corresponds to the higher levels of coherence among countries while a limited use of such policies produces less coherence. This suggests that the European Commission, Regional Seas Conventions and Member States should work together to identify the real connection between the MSFD and other policies to make a proper use of existing data and approaches and to harmonise different policy objectives. In particular, the review shows what might be termed a 'paradox of coherence' amongst Member States where coherence of action has to be achieved within a European policy of subsidiarity, the act of Member States having control over the way they implement framework directives. This can be regarded as a fundamental flaw in having a 'Framework Directive' instead of the greater control in a 'Directive'","Marine","University of York"
"Sessile and mobile components of a benthic ecosystem display mixed trends within a temperate marine reserve.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/84754/","Howarth, Leigh Michael; Pickup, Sarah; Evans, Lowri","March 2015","Despite recent efforts to increase the global coverage of marine protected areas (MPAs), studies investigating the effectiveness of marine protected areas within temperate waters remain scarce. Furthermore, out of the few studies published on MPAs in temperate waters, the majority focus on specific ecological or fishery components rather than investigating the ecosystem as a whole. This study therefore investigated both the dynamics of benthic communities as well as fish populations within a recently established, fully protected marine reserve in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom, over a four year period. A combination of photo and diver surveys revealed live maerl (Phymatolithon calcareum), macroalgae, sponges, hydroids, feather stars and eyelash worms (Myxicola infundibulum) to be significantly more abundant within the marine reserve than on surrounding fishing grounds. Likewise, the overall composition of epifaunal communities in and outside the reserve was significantly different. Both results are consistent with the hypothesis that protecting areas from fishing can encourage seafloor habitats to recover. In addition, the greater abundance of complex habitats within the reserve appeared to providing nursery habitat for juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) and scallops (Pecten maximus and Aequipecten opercularis). In contrast, there was little difference in the abundance of mobile benthic fauna, such as crabs and starfish, between the reserve and outside. Similarly, the use of baited underwater video cameras revealed no difference in the abundance and size of fish between the reserve and outside. Limited recovery of these ecosystem components may be due to the relatively small size (2.67 km2) and young age of the reserve (< 5 years), both of which might have limited the extent of any benefits afforded to mobile fauna and fish communities. Overall, this study provides evidence that fully protected marine reserves can encourage seafloor habitats to recover, which in turn, can create a number of benefits that flow back to other species, including those of commercial importance.","Marine","University of York"

Annual dive surveys from 2010 to 2013 showed the abundance of juvenile scallops to be significantly greater within the marine reserve than outside. Generalised linear models revealed this trend to be significantly related to the greater presence of macroalgae and hydroids growing within the boundaries of the reserve. These results suggest that structurally complex habitats growing within the reserve have substantially increased spat settlement and/or survival. The density of adult king scallops declined threefold with increasing distance from the boundaries of the reserve, indicating possible evidence of spillover or reduced fishing effort directly outside and around the marine reserve. However, there was no difference in the mean density of adult scallops between the reserve and outside. Finally, the mean age, size, and reproductive and exploitable biomass of king scallops were all significantly greater within the reserve. In contrast to king scallops, the population dynamics of queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) fluctuated randomly over the survey period and showed little difference between the reserve and outside. Overall, this study is consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can encourage the recovery of seafloor habitats, which, in turn, can benefit populations of commercially exploited species, emphasising the importance of marine reserves in the ecosystem-based management of fisheries.","Marine","University of York"

In particular it identifies a marked increase in imported cod from the thirteenth century AD. That trend continued into the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after a short downturn, perhaps attributable to the impact of the Black Death, in the mid fourteenth century. The detailed pattern of fluctuating abundance illustrates the potential of archaeological information that is now available from the high-quality urban excavations conducted in London and similar centres during recent decades.","Marine","University of York"

The UK is also home to the largest queen scallop fishery out of all of Europe. However, concerns have been raised about the effects of this recent growth of UK scallop fisheries among scientists and conservation bodies, as well as amongst the public following recent media campaigns (e.g. Hugh’s Fish Fight). This is because the majority of scallop landings (95%) are made by vessels towing scallop dredges, a type of fishing gear known to cause substantial environmental impacts. In addition, several scallop stocks are showing signs of overexploitation and there is concern over future impacts of ocean warming and acidification. Although, there have been several recent improvements in the management of scallop fisheries in parts of the UK, information on many scallop stocks around the UK is still lacking. This report therefore proposes that better monitoring and stock assessments are needed for these scallop fisheries and stocks. With recent legislation soon to result in the development of a new network of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the UK, and improved management of fisheries in European Marine Sites, now is a crucial time to review the UK scallop dredge fishery and its impacts on the wider environment so that this new legislation can support a sustainable future for the UK scallop fishery. This report was therefore commissioned by the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust with the aim of collating existing knowledge on the management and environmental impacts of scallop fisheries around the UK.","Marine","University of York"

"Medical practitioner perspectives on AI in Emergency Triage.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/205519/","Townsend, Bev; Plant, Katherine; Hodge, Victoria J.","September 2023","Background: A proposed Diagnostic AI System for Robot-Assisted Triage (‘DAISY’) is under development to support Emergency Department (‘ED’) triage following increasing reports of overcrowding and shortage of staff in ED care experienced within National Health Service, England (‘NHS’) but also globally. DAISY aims to reduce ED patient wait times and medical practitioner overload. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore NHS health practitioners’ perspectives and attitudes towards the future use of AI-supported technologies in ED triage. Methods: Between July and August 2022 a qualitative-exploratory research study was conducted to collect and capture the perceptions and attitudes of nine NHS healthcare practitioners to better understand the challenges and benefits of a DAISY deployment. The study was based on a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. The study involved qualitative data analysis of the interviewees’ responses. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, and notes included into data documents. The transcripts were coded line-by-line, and data were organised into themes and sub-themes. Both inductive and deductive approaches to thematic analysis were used to analyse such data. Results: Based on a qualitative analysis of coded interviews with the practitioners, responses were categorised into broad main thematic-types, namely: trust; current practice; social, legal, ethical, and cultural concerns; and empathetic practice. Sub-themes were identified for each main theme. Further quantitative analyses explored the vocabulary and sentiments of the participants when talking generally about NHS ED practices compared to discussing DAISY. Limitations include a small sample size and the requirement that research participants imagine a prototype AI-supported system still under development. The expectation is that such a system would work alongside the practitioner. Findings can be generalisable to other healthcare AI-supported systems and to other domains. Conclusions: This study highlights the benefits and challenges for an AI-supported triage healthcare solution. The study shows that most NHS ED practitioners interviewed were positive about such adoption. Benefits cited were a reduction in patient wait times in the ED, assistance in the streamlining of the triage process, support in calling for appropriate diagnostics and for further patient examination, and identification of those very unwell and requiring more immediate and urgent attention. Words used to describe the system were that DAISY is a ‘good idea’, ‘help’, helpful, ‘easier’, ‘value’, and ‘accurate’. Our study demonstrates that trust in the system is a significant driver of use and a potential barrier to adoption. Participants emphasised social, legal, ethical, and cultural considerations and barriers to DAISY adoption and the importance of empathy and non-verbal cues in patient interactions. Findings demonstrate how DAISY might support and augment human medical performance in ED care, and provide an understanding of attitudinal barriers and considerations for the development and implementation of future triage AI-supported systems.","AI","University of York"
"Semantic Data Augmentation for Deep Learning Testing using Generative AI.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202695/","Missaoui, Sondess; Gerasimou, Simos","August 2023","he performance of state-of-the-art Deep Learning models heavily depends on the availability of well-curated training and testing datasets that sufficiently capture the operational domain. Data augmentation is an effective technique in alleviating data scarcity, reducing the time-consuming and expensive data collection and labelling processes. Despite their potential, existing data augmentation techniques primarily focus on simple geometric and colour space transformations, like noise, flipping and resizing, producing datasets with limited diversity. When the augmented dataset is used for testing the Deep Learning models, the derived results are typically uninformative about the robustness of the models. We address this gap by introducing GENFUZZER, a novel coverage-guided data augmentation fuzzing technique for Deep Learning models underpinned by generative AI. We demonstrate our approach using widely-adopted datasets and models employed for image classification, illustrating its effectiveness in generating informative datasets leading up to a 26% increase in widely-used coverage criteria.","AI","University of York"
"Mapping the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare in Africa.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202730/","Townsend, Beverley; Sihlala, Irvine; Naidoo, Meshandren","July 2023","Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries. This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, ‘law’, ‘regulation’, ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘data protection’, ‘intellectual property’, and ‘digital health’ . Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health.","AI","University of York"
"Unravelling Responsibility for AI.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202270/","Porter, Zoe; Al-Qaddoumi, Joanna; Conmy, Philippa Ryan","August 2023","To reason about where responsibility does and should lie in complex situations involving AI-enabled systems, we first need a sufficiently clear and detailed cross-disciplinary vocabulary for talking about responsibility. Responsibility is a triadic relation involving an actor, an occurrence, and a way of being responsible. As part of a conscious effort towards 'unravelling' the concept of responsibility to support practical reasoning about responsibility for AI, this paper takes the three-part formulation, 'Actor A is responsible for Occurrence O' and identifies valid combinations of subcategories of A, is responsible for, and O. These valid combinations - which we term ""responsibility strings"" - are grouped into four senses of responsibility: role-responsibility; causal responsibility; legal liability-responsibility; and moral responsibility. They are illustrated with two running examples, one involving a healthcare AI-based system and another the fatal collision of an AV with a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona in 2018. The output of the paper is 81 responsibility strings. The aim is that these strings provide the vocabulary for people across disciplines to be clear and specific about the different ways that different actors are responsible for different occurrences within a complex event for which responsibility is sought, allowing for precise and targeted interdisciplinary normative deliberations.","AI","University of York"
"Ethics in conversation : Building an ethics assurance case for autonomous AI-enabled voice agents in healthcare.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201792/","Kaas, Marten Henry Leon; Porter, Zoe; Lim, Ernest","May 2023","The deployment and use of AI systems should be both safe and broadly ethically acceptable. The principles-based ethics assurance argument pattern is one proposal in the AI ethics landscape that seeks to support and achieve that aim. The purpose of this argument pattern or framework is to structure reasoning about, and to communicate and foster confidence in, the ethical acceptability of uses of specific real-world AI systems in complex socio-technical contexts. This paper presents the interim findings of a case study applying this ethics assurance framework to the use of Dora, an AI-based telemedicine system, to assess its viability and usefulness as an approach. The case study process to date has revealed some of the positive ethical impacts of the Dora platform, as well as unexpected insights and areas to prioritise for evaluation, such as risks to the frontline clinician, particularly in respect of clinician autonomy. The ethics assurance argument pattern offers a practical framework not just for identifying issues to be addressed, but also to start to construct solutions in the form of adjustments to the distribution of benefits, risks and constraints on human autonomy that could reduce ethical disparities across affected stakeholders. Though many challenges remain, this research represents a step in the direction towards the development and use of safe and ethically acceptable AI systems and, ideally, a shift towards more comprehensive and inclusive evaluations of AI systems in general.","AI","University of York"
"Diffusion-Jump GNNs : Homophiliation via Learnable Metric Filters.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/202154/","Begga, Ahmed; Escolano, Francisco; Lozano, Miguel Angel","June 2023","High-order Graph Neural Networks (HO-GNNs) have been developed to infer consistent latent spaces in the heterophilic regime, where the label distribution is not correlated with the graph structure. However, most of the existing HO-GNNs are hop-based, i.e., they rely on the powers of the transition matrix. As a result, these architectures are not fully reactive to the classification loss and the achieved structural filters have static supports. In other words, neither the filters' supports nor their coefficients can be learned with these networks. They are confined, instead, to learn combinations of filters. To address the above concerns, we propose Diffusion-jump GNNs a method relying on asymptotic diffusion distances that operates on jumps. A diffusion-pump generates pairwise distances whose projections determine both the support and coefficients of each structural filter. These filters are called jumps because they explore a wide range of scales in order to find bonds between scattered nodes with the same label. Actually, the full process is controlled by the classification loss. Both the jumps and the diffusion distances react to classification errors (i.e. they are learnable). Homophiliation, i.e., the process of learning piecewise smooth latent spaces in the heterophilic regime, is formulated as a Dirichlet problem: the known labels determine the border nodes and the diffusion-pump ensures a minimal deviation of the semi-supervised grouping from a canonical unsupervised grouping. This triggers the update of both the diffusion distances and, consequently, the jumps in order to minimize the classification error. The Dirichlet formulation has several advantages. It leads to the definition of structural heterophily, a novel measure beyond edge heterophily. It also allows us to investigate links with (learnable) diffusion distances, absorbing random walks and stochastic diffusion.","AI","University of York"
"A principles-based ethics assurance argument pattern for AI and autonomous systems.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200084/","Porter, Zoe; Habli, Ibrahim; McDermid, John Alexander","May 2023","An assurance case is a structured argument, typically produced by safety engineers, to communicate confidence that a critical or complex system, such as an aircraft, will be acceptably safe within its intended context. Assurance cases often inform third party approval of a system. One emerging proposition within the trustworthy AI and autonomous systems (AI/AS) research community is to use assurance cases to instil justified confidence that specific AI/AS will be ethically acceptable when operational in well-defined contexts. This paper substantially develops the proposition and makes it concrete. It brings together the assurance case methodology with a set of ethical principles to structure a principles-based ethics assurance argument pattern. The principles are justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for human autonomy, with the principle of transparency playing a supporting role. The argument pattern—shortened to the acronym PRAISE—is described. The objective of the proposed PRAISE argument pattern is to provide a reusable template for individual ethics assurance cases, by which engineers, developers, operators, or regulators could justify, communicate, or challenge a claim about the overall ethical acceptability of the use of a specific AI/AS in a given socio-technical context. We apply the pattern to the hypothetical use case of an autonomous ‘robo-taxi’ service in a city centre.","AI","University of York"
"Predicting Progression of Type 2 Diabetes Using Primary Care Data with the Help of Machine Learning.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199511/","Ozturk, Berk; Lawton, Tom; Smith, Stephen","May 2023","Type 2 diabetes is a life-long health condition, and as it progresses, A range of comorbidities can develop. The prevalence of diabetes has increased gradually, and it is expected that 642 million adults will be living with diabetes by 2040. Early and proper interventions for managing diabetes-related comorbidities are important. In this study, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting the risk of developing hypertension for patients who already have Type 2 diabetes. We used the Connected Bradford dataset, consisting of 1.4 million patients, as our main dataset for data analysis and model building. As a result of data analysis, we found that hypertension is the most frequent observation among patients having Type 2 diabetes. Since hypertension is very important to predict clinically poor outcomes such as risk of heart, brain, kidney, and other diseases, it is crucial to make early and accurate predictions of the risk of having hypertension for Type 2 diabetic patients. We used Naïve Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to train our model. Then we ensembled these models to see the potential performance improvement. The ensemble method gave the best classification performance values of accuracy and kappa values of 0.9525 and 0.2183, respectively. We concluded that predicting the risk of developing hypertension for Type 2 diabetic patients using ML provides a promising stepping stone for preventing the Type 2 diabetes progression.","AI","University of York"
"Examining Trust and Willingness to Accept AI Recommendation Systems.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199005/","Pal, Anjan; Chua, Alton Y.K.; Banerjee, Snehasish","January 2023","This paper proposes and tests a conceptual model that identifies the antecedents of trust in AI, which could in turn lead to users’ willingness to accept AI recommendation systems. An online survey was conducted in the context of stock market investment. Responses came from 313 participants with prior investment experiences. Data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results indicate that attitude towards AI and perceived AI accuracy were positively related to users’ trust in AI. Users’ AI anxiety was negatively related to trust in AI. Furthermore, users’ trust in AI was positively related to their willingness to accept AI recommendation systems. The paper extends previous works by explicating the role of users’ trust in AI and suggests that the uptake of AI systems can be promoted by fostering favorable attitudes, greater perceived AI accuracy, and lowering AI anxiety.","AI","University of York"
"AI-enabled investment advice : Will users buy it?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/190888/","Chua, Alton Y.K.; Pal, Anjan; Banerjee, Snehasish","September 2022","This paper develops an attitude-perception-intention (API) model of AI acceptance to explain individuals’ behavioral intention to accept AI-based recommendations as a function of attitude toward AI, trust and perceived accuracy with risk-level as a moderator. The API model was empirically validated through a between-participants experiment (N = 368) using a simulated AI-enabled investment recommendation system. One experimental condition depicted low-risk investment recommendation involving blue-chip stocks while the other depicted high-risk investment recommendation involving penny stocks. Attitude toward AI predicted behavioral intention to accept AI-based recommendations, trust in AI, and perceived accuracy of AI. Furthermore, risk level emerged as a significant moderator. When risk was low, a favourable attitude toward AI seemed sufficient to promote algorithmic reliance. However, when risk was high, a favourable attitude toward AI was a necessary but no longer sufficient condition for AI acceptance. The API model contributes to the human-AI interaction literature by not only shedding light on the underlying psychological mechanism of how users buy into AI-enabled advice but also adding to the scholarly understanding of AI recommendation systems in tasks that call for intuition in high involvement services such as finance where human counsel is usually preferred to machine-generated advice.","AI","University of York"
"The need for the human-centred explanation for ML-based clinical decision support systems.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198038/","Jia, Yan; McDermid, John; Hughes, Nathan","January 2023","Machine learning has shown great promise in a variety of applications, but the deployment of these systems is hindered by the ""opaque"" nature of machine learning algorithms. This has led to the development of explainable AI methods, which aim to provide insights into complex algorithms through explanations that are comprehensible to humans. However, many of the explanations currently available are technically focused and reflect what machine learning researchers believe constitutes a good explanation, rather than what users actually want. This paper highlights the need to develop human-centred explanations for machine learning-based clinical decision support systems, as clinicians who typically have limited knowledge of machine learning techniques are the users of these systems. The authors define the requirements for human-centred explanations, then briefly discuss the current state of available explainable AI methods, and finally analyse the gaps between human-centred explanations and current explainable AI methods. A clinical use case is presented to demonstrate the vision for human-centred explanations.","AI","University of York"
"Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion by Exploiting the Open Corpus.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200224/","Wang, Yue; Wan, Yao; Bai, Lu","June 2022","To alleviate the challenges of building Knowledge Graphs (KG) from scratch, a more general task is to enrich a KG using triples from an open corpus, where the obtained triples contain noisy entities and relations. It is challenging to enrich a KG with newly harvested triples while maintaining the quality of the knowledge representation. This paper proposes a system to refine a KG using information harvested from an additional corpus. To this end, we formulate our task as two coupled sub-tasks, namely join event extraction (JEE) and knowledge graph fusion (KGF). We then propose a Collaborative Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework to allow our sub-tasks to mutually assist one another in an alternating manner. More concretely, the explorer carries out the JEE supervised by both the ground-truth annotation and an existing KG provided by the supervisor. The supervisor then evaluates the triples extracted by the explorer and enriches the KG with those that are highly ranked. To implement this evaluation, we further propose a Translated Relation Alignment Scoring Mechanism to align and translate the extracted triples to the prior KG. Experiments verify that this collaboration can both improve the performance of the JEE and the KGF.","AI","University of York"
"Two-level Graph Neural Network.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200203/","Ai, Xing; Sun, Chengyu; Zhang, Zhihong","January 2022","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recently proposed neural network structures for the processing of graph-structured data. Due to their employed neighbor aggregation strategy, existing GNNs focus on capturing node-level information and neglect high-level information. Existing GNNs therefore suffer from representational limitations caused by the Local Permutation Invariance (LPI) problem. To overcome these limitations and enrich the features captured by GNNs, we propose a novel GNN framework, referred to as the Two-level GNN (TL-GNN). This merges subgraph-level information with node-level information. Moreover, we provide a mathematical analysis of the LPI problem which demonstrates that subgraph-level information is beneficial to overcoming the problems associated with LPI. A subgraph counting method based on the dynamic programming algorithm is also proposed, and this has time complexity is O(n^3), n is the number of nodes of a graph. Experiments show that TL-GNN outperforms existing GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.","AI","University of York"
"Proceed with Caution.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/175184/","Zimmermann, Annette; Lee-Stronach, Chad","June 2021","It is becoming more common that the decision-makers in private and public institutions are predictive algorithmic systems, not humans. This article argues that relying on algorithmic systems is procedurally unjust in contexts involving background conditions of structural injustice. Under such nonideal conditions, algorithmic systems, if left to their own devices, cannot meet a necessary condition of procedural justice, because they fail to provide a sufficiently nuanced model of which cases count as relevantly similar. Resolving this problem requires deliberative capacities uniquely available to human agents. After exploring the limitations of existing formal algorithmic fairness strategies, the article argues that procedural justice requires that human agents relying wholly or in part on algorithmic systems proceed with caution: by avoiding doxastic negligence about algorithmic outputs, by exercising deliberative capacities when making similarity judgments, and by suspending belief and gathering additional information in light of higher-order uncertainty.","AI","University of York"
"Designing A Clinically Applicable Deep Recurrent Model to Identify Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in People Living with Dementia Using In-Home Monitoring Data.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200233/","Palermo, Francesca; Li, Honglin; Capstick, Alexander","October 2021","Agitation is one of the neuropsychiatric symptoms with high prevalence in dementia which can negatively impact the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and the independence of individuals. Detecting agitation episodes can assist in providing People Living with Dementia (PLWD) with early and timely interventions. Analysing agitation episodes will also help identify modifiable factors such as ambient temperature and sleep as possible components causing agitation in an individual. This preliminary study presents a supervised learning model to analyse the risk of agitation in PLWD using in-home monitoring data. The in-home monitoring data includes motion sensors, physiological measurements, and the use of kitchen appliances from 46 homes of PLWD between April 2019-June 2021. We apply a recurrent deep learning model to identify agitation episodes validated and recorded by a clinical monitoring team. We present the experiments to assess the efficacy of the proposed model. The proposed model achieves an average of 79.78% recall, 27.66% precision and 37.64% F1 scores when employing the optimal parameters, suggesting a good ability to recognise agitation events. We also discuss using machine learning models for analysing the behavioural patterns using continuous monitoring data and explore clinical applicability and the choices between sensitivity and specificity in-home monitoring applications.","AI","University of York"

One, Artificial Intelligence’s (AI’s) Machine Learning (ML) techniques have the potential to help separate information and misinformation, but this capability has yet to be empirically verified in the context of COVID-19. Two, while older adults can be particularly susceptible to the virus as well as its online infodemic, their information processing behaviour amid the pandemic has not been understood. Therefore, this study explores and understands how ML techniques (Study 1), and humans, particularly older adults (Study 2), process the online infodemic regarding COVID-19 prevention and cure. Study 1 employed ML techniques to classify information and misinformation. They achieved a classification accuracy of 86.7% with the Decision Tree classifier, and 86.67% with the Convolutional Neural Network model. Study 2 then investigated older adults’ information processing behaviour during the COVID-19 infodemic period using some of the posts from Study 1. Twenty older adults were interviewed. They were found to be more willing to trust traditional media rather than new media. They were often left confused about the veracity of online content related to COVID-19 prevention and cure. Overall, the paper breaks new ground by highlighting how humans’ information processing differs from how algorithms operate. It offers fresh insights into how during a pandemic, older adults—a vulnerable demographic segment—interact with online information and misinformation. On the methodological front, the paper represents an intersection of two very disparate paradigms—ML techniques and interview data analyzed using thematic analysis and concepts drawn from grounded theory to enrich the scholarly understanding of human interaction with cutting-edge technologies.","AI","University of York"
"Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Activity Recognition.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200231/","Zhao, Yuchen; Liu, Hanyang; Li, Honglin","March 2021","Training deep learning models on in-home IoT sensory data is commonly used to recognise human activities. Recently, federated learning systems that use edge devices as clients to support local human activity recognition have emerged as a new paradigm to combine local (individual-level) and global (group-level) models. This approach provides better scalability and generalisability and also offers better privacy compared with the traditional centralised analysis and learning models. The assumption behind federated learning, however, relies on supervised learning on clients. This requires a large volume of labelled data, which is difficult to collect in uncontrolled IoT environments such as remote in-home monitoring. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition system that uses semi-supervised federated learning, wherein clients conduct unsupervised learning on autoencoders with unlabelled local data to learn general representations, and a cloud server conducts supervised learning on an activity classifier with labelled data. Our experimental results show that using a long short-term memory autoencoder and a Softmax classifier, the accuracy of our proposed system is higher than that of both centralised systems and semi-supervised federated learning using data augmentation. The accuracy is also comparable to that of supervised federated learning systems. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our system can reduce the number of needed labels and the size of local models, and has faster local activity recognition speed than supervised federated learning does.","AI","University of York"
