"Cultivating China’s FinTech ecosystem: The visible hand of the state.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/203766/","Pažitka, V.; Wójcik, D.; Wu, W.","September 2023","We investigate the role of open system intermediaries (OSIs), including incubators, accelerators and science parks, in the effort of the Chinese state to harness the innovative potential of fintech ventures. We conducted 50 semi-structured interviews and documented how the Chinese state uses OSIs to support strategically important financial services firms in nurturing cohorts of fintech ventures. This consequently gives rise to a tech-for-fin ecosystem, where innovative fintech ventures are moulded into becoming technology providers for financial services incumbents, while those wishing to fundamentally disrupt the established financial order are excluded from the various support mechanisms provided through OSIs.","Tech","University of Leeds"

"Gaps in academic literature on venture capitalists’ decision-making on funding for early-stage, high-tech ventures.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/94498/","Brusche, LA","January 2016","Recognizing venture capital as a crucial source of funds for life science start-ups, this review paper focuses on the academic literature on venture capitalists’ decision-making process on granting funding to early-stage, high-tech ventures. This review identified the following three issues: First, despite three dominant factors in venture capitalists’ decision-making process, which are identified to be the human, technological and financial aspects of the potential start-up, a great variety of further factors exists and generalization to a great extent is difficult. Secondly, little research has been conducted in Europe and little research employed inductive, qualitative methods. Thirdly, the latest study focusing on a ranking of the importance of decision-making factors for venture capitalists lies 29 years in the past and has been conducted with a North-American sample, leaving a gap for future research in Europe.","Tech","University of Leeds"
"Institutionalising science and knowledge under the agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ): Stakeholder perspectives on a fit-for-purpose Scientific and Technical Body.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/207240/","Gaebel, C.; Novo Nunez, P.; Johnson, D.E.","December 2023","The use of science, scientific information, and other knowledge to inform decision-making is increasingly recognised as an integral feature of environmental governance – a governance principle which is reflected in the new agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement). To support the integration of science and knowledge, the BBNJ Agreement establishes a Scientific and Technical Body (STB) and confers the task of finalising the formulation and function of this new advisory body to the Conference of Parties once the agreement enters into force. Therefore, it is a critical time for careful consideration of what is needed to achieve an effective STB. However, to date, there is limited research on what a fit-for-purpose STB would involve for BBNJ or what is needed to operationalise this in practice. As such, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by providing insights garnered from semi-structured interviews with key BBNJ stakeholders. Using qualitative content analysis, we identify and examine eight characteristics that stakeholders deem as important qualities for the STB to encompass, as well as challenges and opportunities for operationalising these qualities in practice. Our findings indicate that a fit-for-purpose STB extends beyond the mere production of high-quality scientific advice - it also necessitates the inclusion and due consideration of other fundamental qualities such as inclusivity and equity, transparency, flexibility, and synergy with the existing governance framework, amongst others, as well as proactive consideration of trade-offs associated with different design choices. These findings are pertinent to the forthcoming endeavour of designing and implementing an STB under the BBNJ Agreement, and more generally, provide insights on normative qualities that stakeholders perceive as important for science-policy interfaces.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"An approach for assessing and ranking fisheries management scenarios in spatially delimited marine areas.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/198591/","Clare, DS; Martinez, R; Goodsir, F","February 2023","Spatial restrictions to human activities such as bottom trawling are increasingly used to improve the ecological condition of disturbed habitats. Such management interventions typically have socio-economic consequences, which creates a challenge for those making decisions about which activities should be restricted and where restrictions should apply. We present an approach for predicting the effects of fisheries management scenarios in spatially delimited marine areas and ranking them—using a loss function—according to how well they achieve desired outcomes across a set of ecological and socio-economic indicators. This approach is demonstrated by simulating alternative fishing gear restrictions and zoning options within a hypothetical marine protected area (MPA). Relative benthic status (RBS; an indicator of ecological condition) and relative catch value (RCV; an indicator of potential economic cost) were estimated for the baseline environment and 21 potential management scenarios. The rank order depended on which indicator was prioritized (i.e. whether RBS or RCV was given greater weighting in the loss function), with the top-ranked scenarios in each case involving considerably different management measures. The methods presented can be applied anywhere using locally or strategically relevant indicators to help identify spatial fisheries management measures that minimize ecological and socio-economic trade-offs.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Diversification of refugia types needed to secure the future of coral reefs subject to climate change.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/200546/","McClanahan, TR; Darling, ES; Beger, M","April 2023","Identifying locations of refugia from the thermal stresses of climate change for coral reefs and better managing them is one of the key recommendations for climate change adaptation. We review and summarize approximately 30 years of applied research focused on identifying climate refugia to prioritize the conservation actions for coral reefs under rapid climate change. We found that currently proposed climate refugia and the locations predicted to avoid future coral losses are highly reliant on  excess heat metrics, such as degree heating weeks. However, many existing alternative environmental, ecological, and life-history variables could be used to identify other types of refugia that lead to the desired diversified portfolio for coral reef conservation. To improve conservation priorities for coral reefs, there is a need to evaluate and validate the predictions of climate refugia with long-term field data on coral abundance, diversity, and functioning. There is also the need to identify and safeguard locations displaying resistance toprolonged exposure to heat waves and the ability to recover quickly after thermal exposure. We recommend using more metrics to identify a portfolio of potential refugia sites for coral reefs that can avoid, resist, and recover from exposure to high ocean temperatures and the consequences of climate change, thereby shifting past efforts focused on avoidance to a diversified risk-spreading portfolio that can be used to improve strategic coral reef conservation in a rapidly warming climate.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Exposure of wild Caspian seals (Pusa caspica) to parasites, bacterial and viral pathogens, evaluated via molecular and serological assays.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197640/","Kydyrmanov, A; Karamendin, K; Kasymbekov, Y","March 2023","Disease surveillance of marine mammal populations is essential to understand the causes of strandings, identify potential threats to animal health, and to support development of conservation strategies. Here we report the first large multi-pathogen screening of prevalence for viruses, bacteria and parasites in a sample of 177 live, healthy, wild Caspian seals (Pusa caspica), captured and released during satellite telemetry studies 2007-2017. Employing molecular and serological assays we assess prevalence of pathogens known to be of significance for marine mammal health worldwide, and evaluate the results in relation to Caspian seal health and conservation. RT-PCR, and PCR assays find evidence for infection by Canine Distemper Virus (CDV), Phocine herpes virus, phocine adenovirus and Influenza A at prevalences of 5%, 6.4%, 21.7%, and 4% respectively. The genomes of CDV isolates collected in 2008 showed 99.59% identity with the 2000 Caspian seal CDV epizootic strain. A partial coding sequence for the Us2 gene from the Caspian seal herpes virus was identical to PhHV-1 isolate PB84, previously reported from a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), while amplicon sequences for the adenovirus polymerase gene indicated a novel strain. ELISA assays detected exposure to Influenza A (55% of tested samples), adenovirus (25%), coronavirus (6%), CDV (8%), herpes virus (94%), Toxoplasma gondii (2.6%) and heartworm (1%). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests detected exposure to Influenza B at a prevalence of 20%, and Leptospira microscopic agglutination tests detected suspected exposure to Leptospira serovars in 9% of tested samples. Overall, the risks, profile and prevalence of pathogens in Caspian seals appear comparable to other wild phocid seal populations. Our results suggest Caspian seals have exposure pathways to pathogens with epizootic potential or ability to cause significant morbidity, and disease impacts could reduce the resilience of the population to other conservation threats. Caspian seals are listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and we recommend that resources are invested to support further surveillance programmes and to understand how anthropogenic pressures may influence future disease risks.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Sampling from commercial vessel routes can capture marine biodiversity distributions effectively.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195840/","Boyse, E; Beger, M; Valsecchi, E","January 2023","Collecting fine-scale occurrence data for marine species across large spatial scales is logistically challenging but is important to determine species distributions and for conservation planning. Inaccurate descriptions of species ranges could result in designating protected areas with inappropriate locations or boundaries. Optimizing sampling strategies therefore is a priority for scaling up survey approaches using tools such as environmental DNA (eDNA) to capture species distributions. In a marine context, commercial vessels, such as ferries, could provide sampling platforms allowing access to undersampled areas and repeatable sampling over time to track community changes. However, sample collection from commercial vessels could be biased and may not represent biological and environmental variability. Here, we evaluate whether sampling along Mediterranean ferry routes can yield unbiased biodiversity survey outcomes, based on perfect knowledge from a stacked species distribution model (SSDM) of marine megafauna derived from online data repositories. Simulations to allocate sampling point locations were carried out representing different sampling strategies (random vs regular), frames (ferry routes vs unconstrained), and number of sampling points. SSDMs were remade from different sampling simulations and compared with the “perfect knowledge” SSDM to quantify the bias associated with different sampling strategies. Ferry routes detected more species and were able to recover known patterns in species richness at smaller sample sizes better than unconstrained sampling points. However, to minimize potential bias, ferry routes should be chosen to cover the variability in species composition and its environmental predictors in the SSDMs. The workflow presented here can be used to design effective sampling strategies using commercial vessel routes globally for eDNA and other biodiversity survey techniques. This approach has potential to provide a cost-effective method to access remote oceanic areas on a regular basis and can recover meaningful data on spatiotemporal biodiversity patterns.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"A response to community questions on the Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve: marine reservoir ages and the calibration of ¹⁴C samples from the oceans.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199958/","Heaton, TJ; Bard, E; Bronk Ramsey, C","November 2022","Radiocarbon (14C) concentrations in the oceans are different from those in the atmosphere. Understanding these ocean-atmospheric 14C differences is important both to estimate the calendar ages of samples which obtained their 14C in the marine environment, and to investigate the carbon cycle. The Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve is created to address these dual aims by providing a global-scale surface ocean record of radiocarbon from 55,000–0 cal yr BP that accounts for the smoothed response of the ocean to variations in atmospheric 14C production rates and factors out the effect of known changes in global-scale palaeoclimatic variables. The curve also serves as a baseline to study regional oceanic 14C variation. Marine20 offers substantial improvements over the previous Marine13 curve. In response to community questions, we provide a short intuitive guide, intended for the lay-reader, on the construction and use of the Marine20 calibration curve. We describe the choices behind the making of Marine20, as well as the similarities and differences compared with the earlier Marine calibration curves. We also describe how to use the Marine20 curve for calibration and how to estimate ΔR—the localized variation in the oceanic 14C levels due to regional factors which are not incorporated in the global-scale Marine20 curve. To aid understanding, illustrative worked examples are provided.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Shallow- and deep-ocean Fe cycling and redox evolution across the Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary and Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event in Panthalassa.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194241/","Chen, W; Kemp, DB; He, T","December 2022","The late Pliensbachian to early Toarcian was characterized by major climatic and environmental changes, encompassing the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, or Jenkyns Event, ∼183 Ma) and the preceding Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary event (Pl/To). Information on seawater redox conditions through this time interval has thus far come mainly from European sections deposited in hydrographically restricted basins, and hence our understanding of the redox evolution of the open ocean (and in particular Panthalassa – the largest ocean to have existed) is limited. Here, we present high-resolution Fe-speciation and redox-sensitive trace metal data from two Panthalassic Ocean sections across the Pl/To and the T-OAE intervals, one deposited in deep water (paleo-water depth >∼2.7 km) and the other on a shallow margin (paleo-water depth likely <∼50 m). Data from the deep-water open-ocean site indicate anoxic-ferruginous conditions from the late Pliensbachian to the onset of the T-OAE, with a rather fluctuating redox state alternating between oxic and anoxic/euxinic conditions across the Pl/To boundary. At least intermittent bottom-water euxinia characterized the T-OAE, followed by a subsequent transition toward more oxygenated conditions. By contrast, trace metal data from the shallow margin site indicate that oxygenated to possibly suboxic conditions prevailed. However, elevated highly reactive iron contents, dominated by Fe (oxyhydr)oxides, characterize this shallow-water site. These observations suggest that upwelling, driven in part by increased sea level and prevailing winds from the open ocean, brought anoxic-ferruginous waters onto the shelf, whereupon Fe2+ oxidation was initiated in oxic shallow waters.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Unifying approaches to Functional Marine Connectivity for improved marine resource management: the European SEA-UNICORN COST Action.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/196337/","Darnaude, AM; Arnaud-Haond, S; Hunter, E","December 2022","Truly sustainable development in a human-altered, fragmented marine environment subject to unprecedented climate change, demands informed planning strategies in order to be successful. Beyond a simple understanding of the distribution of marine species, data describing how variations in spatio-temporal dynamics impact ecosystem functioning and the evolution of species are required. Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC) characterizes the flows of matter, genes and energy produced by organism movements and migrations across the seascape. As such, MFC determines the ecological and evolutionary interdependency of populations, and ultimately the fate of species and ecosystems. Gathering effective MFC knowledge can therefore improve predictions of the impacts of environmental change and help to refine management and conservation strategies for the seas and oceans. Gathering these data are challenging however, as access to, and survey of marine ecosystems still presents significant challenge. Over 50 European institutions currently investigate aspects of MFC using complementary methods across multiple research fields, to understand the ecology and evolution of marine species. The aim of SEA-UNICORN, a COST Action supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology), is to bring together this research effort, unite the multiple approaches to MFC, and to integrate these under a common conceptual and analytical framework. The consortium brings together a diverse group of scientists to collate existing MFC data, to identify knowledge gaps, to enhance complementarity among disciplines, and to devise common approaches to MFC. SEA-UNICORN will promote co-working between connectivity practitioners and ecosystem modelers to facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the predictive models used to identify marine conservation priorities. Ultimately, SEA-UNICORN will forge strong forward-working links between scientists, policy-makers and stakeholders to facilitate the integration of MFC knowledge into decision support tools for marine management and environmental policies.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Integrating larval connectivity into the marine conservation decision-making process across spatial scales.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194659/","Muenzel, D; Critchell, K; Cox, C","October 2022","Larval dispersal connectivity is typically integrated into spatial conservation decisions at regional or national scales, but implementing agencies struggle with translating these methods to local scales. We used larval dispersal connectivity at regional (hundreds of kilometers) and local (tens of kilometers) scales to aid in design of networks of no-take reserves in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. We used Marxan with Connectivity informed by biophysical larval dispersal models and remotely sensed coral reef habitat data to design marine reserve networks for 4 commercially important reef species across the region. We complemented regional spatial prioritization with decision trees that combined network-based connectivity metrics and habitat quality to design reserve boundaries locally. Decision trees were used in consensus-based workshops with stakeholders to qualitatively assess site desirability, and Marxan was used to identify areas for subsequent network expansion. Priority areas for protection and expected benefits differed among species, with little overlap in reserve network solutions. Because reef quality varied considerably across reefs, we suggest reef degradation must inform the interpretation of larval dispersal patterns and the conservation benefits achievable from protecting reefs. Our methods can be readily applied by conservation practitioners, in this region and elsewhere, to integrate connectivity data across multiple spatial scales.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The inclusion of fisheries and tourism in marine protected areas to support conservation in Indonesia.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195324/","Tranter, SN; Estradivari; Ahmadia, GN","September 2022","With the rapid growth of Indonesia’s marine protected area (MPAs) estate in Indonesia, reaching 23.9 million hectares by January 2020, attention needs to be focused on strengthening the effectiveness of MPA management. Consolidating and expanding protection of Indonesia’s marine resources is critical with increasing pressure from a fast-expanding population, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, pollution, coastal development, unsustainable tourism and climate change. Biodiversity conservation must therefore concurrently consider multiple economic sectors such as fisheries and tourism, and their synergies with MPA management. This paper aims to outline the current landscape of fisheries and marine tourism pertaining to area-based conservation in Indonesia, to inform and support improved integration into effective MPA management. Four areas to focus efforts were identified: diversification of governance types of community-based management, improved coordination between fisheries and MPAs during planning and management implementation, the development and support of pathways for sustainable tourism, and planning for future conditions. Sustainable development for fisheries and tourism must be incorporated into all aspects of MPA management, whilst recognising that current management systems are insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability for natural resources and local communities, and strategies need to increase resilience of social-ecological systems in anticipation of future conditions.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Enabling the informal recycling sector to prevent plastic pollution and deliver an inclusive circular economy.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/192223/","Velis, CA; Hardesty, BD; Cottom, JW","September 2022","Recycling by the informal sector provides a rapid, inexpensive solution to plastic pollution, whilst supporting the livelihoods via their inclusion and empowerment. This solution will have the greatest benefit to the environment if supporting interventions are targeted at types of plastic pollution that are the most damaging from an ecological and wider risk perspective. Interventions should target three aspects of the pollution: reducing barriers to collection, improving the revenue from the materials and wider informal recycler remuneration, and increasing the quality of the materials. Done well, these interventions will increase the collection rate, reduce pollution from plastics, and help millions of people escape poverty. They present a scalable international solution to a global challenge; and are likely the only viable solution to the widespread lack of solid waste services and infrastructure across low- and middle-income countries.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Dynamic ocean redox conditions during the end-Triassic mass extinction: Evidence from pyrite framboids.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194884/","Li, J; Song, H; Tian, L","October 2022","The end-Triassic (∼201 Mya) records one of the five largest mass extinction events of the Phanerozoic. Extinction losses were coincident with large igneous province volcanism in the form of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and major carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), suggesting a link between these phenomena. Marine anoxia has been implicated as a causal factor in the crisis, but there remains some uncertainty regarding the role of marine redox changes in marine extinction phases because both intensity and duration of marine anoxia are poorly constrained. We employ high resolution pyrite framboid size-frequency analysis at two Triassic-Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary sections: Kuhjoch in Austria (the Tr-J Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point; GSSP) and St. Audrie's Bay in England (former GSSP candidate) in order to further evaluate the role of marine anoxia in the end-Triassic mass extinction (ETME). The St. Audrie's Bay section records predominantly anoxic conditions punctuated by weakly oxygenated (dysoxic) conditions through the Tr-J transition, even during shallow-water intervals. Kuhjoch experienced both anoxic and dysoxic conditions during the ETME but became better oxygenated near the Tr-J boundary. Marine anoxia is therefore implicated in the extinction at both locations. A similar redox history is known from the Central European Basin, Western Tethys and Panthalassa, where marine anoxia developed in the lead up to the ETME prior to reoxygenation around the Tr-J boundary.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Alleviating impacts of climate change on fishing communities using weather information to improve fishers’ resilience.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193695/","Okeke-Ogbuafor, N; Taylor, A; Dougill, A","October 2022","This study contributes new knowledge in evaluating actions aimed at alleviating impacts of climate change on small-scale fishers and enhancing resilience in their households in West Africa. Evidence of the damage caused by climate change to the artisanal fisheries sector in West African countries is accumulating. Current measures in place for artisanal fishers to adapt to these changes include broad long-term pro-poor strategies designed to manage the persistent problem of overfishing and declining fish stocks. However, one immediate coping strategy is beginning to emerge, the more active use of reliable weather information. Based on 80 semi-structured interviews conducted in Senegal, Ghana, and Nigeria between 2021 and 2022, this study investigates claims that the use of weather information (WI) is helping West African artisanal fishers and those involved in secondary fishery activities to build more climate-resilient household income and food security. Unlike the long-term measures for mitigating the impact of climate change, results from the study show that by assessing the risk, their marine capture activities using weather information, fishers are immediately benefitting. Using the diffusion of the innovation theory to investigate the pattern of fishers’ adoption and usage of weather information, we found that Senegalese marine artisanal fishers can be classified as “Early Adopters” of this innovation. However, this is not the case with inland fishers who remain skeptical and will only use weather information if they can ascertain its reliability. West Africa’s inland fisheries sector is often neglected in climate change strategies: there is a lack of coordinated action to understand the weather information needs of these vulnerable fishers in order to coassess and codevelop bespoke weather products that offer benefits to them. However, West Africa’s fisheries, especially those inland, are too important to ignore if the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), including no poverty and zero hunger, are to be achieved. To help this sector fully benefit from the use of weather information, this study recommends detailed research into the weather information needs of these fishers and user-friendly ways to engage with the fishers to transmit the information.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Short-takeoff marine vehicle with circulation flow control of wing-in-ground effect.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/192726/","Aslani, A; Shires, A; Shahsavari, A","July 2022","The concept of active circulation control has been proposed to improve lifting performance for various applications. It is mostly suggested as a flow control system to replace or minimize mechanical flaps or as a boundary layer control mechanism in the aerospace industry. The efficiency of these systems has always been the main concern due to increased drag and pumping requirements. These concerns are negligible for high-speed marine crafts as the hydrodynamic drag acting on the hull is dominant. This research investigates the aerodynamic performance of a NACA 4412 airfoil that was modified for circulation control to determine the influence of the trailing-edge geometry, blowing coefficient, angle of attack, and height above the ground to improve the efficiency of a wing-in-ground craft and shorten its take-off distance. The flow is subsonic and incompressible, and the chord Reynolds number is 1.7 × 106. A computational fluid dynamics investigation has determined that significant increases in lift can be attained through circulation control relative to the original NACA 4412 airfoil, and it is not significantly influenced by the airfoil height except when there is an extreme ground effect. Also, the lift augmentation increases approximately linearly with the blowing momentum coefficient and angle of attack. The study shows a significant improvement in the take-off length, which was reduced from 465 m to between 360 and 150 m according to the height above the ground plane, angle of attack, and the momentum coefficient when the Coanda surface is 30 mm. The circulation-controlled NACA 4412 could achieve 66% effectiveness compared to a currently available vehicle.","Marine","University of Leeds"

An assessment is made of how geomorphological characteristics vary with respect to the position of the canyon apex relative to the shelf break, continental-margin type, terrestrial source-to-sink system setting, oceanographic environment, and latitude. Scaling relationships between canyon morphometric parameters, and correlations between these and attributes of the canyon physiographic settings, terrestrial catchments, and continental shelves and slopes, have been quantified.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Comparing spatial conservation prioritization methods with site versus spatial dependency‐based connectivity.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/193940/","Muenzel, D; Critchell, K; Cox, C","September 2022","Larval dispersal is an important component of marine reserve networks. Two conceptually different approaches to incorporate dispersal connectivity into spatial planning of these networks exist, and it is an open question as to when either is most appropriate. Candidate reserve sites can be selected individually based on local properties of connectivity or on a spatial dependency-based approach of selecting clusters of strongly connected habitat patches. The first acts on individual sites, whereas the second acts on linked pairs of sites. We used a combination of larval dispersal simulations representing different seascapes and case studies of biophysical larval dispersal models in the Coral Triangle region and the province of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, to compare the performance of these 2 methods in the spatial planning software Marxan. We explored the reserve design performance implications of different dispersal distances and patterns based on the equilibrium settlement of larvae in protected and unprotected areas. We further assessed different assumptions about metapopulation contributions from unprotected areas, including the case of 100% depletion and more moderate scenarios. The spatial dependency method was suitable when dispersal was limited, a high proportion of the area of interest was substantially degraded, or the target amount of habitat protected was low. Conversely, when subpopulations were well connected, the 100% depletion was relaxed, or more habitat was protected, protecting individual sites with high scores in metrics of connectivity was a better strategy. Spatial dependency methods generally produced more spatially clustered solutions with more benefits inside than outside reserves compared with site-based methods. Therefore, spatial dependency methods potentially provide better results for ecological persistence objectives over enhancing fisheries objectives, and vice versa. Different spatial prioritization methods of using connectivity are appropriate for different contexts, depending on dispersal characteristics, unprotected area contributions, habitat protection targets, and specific management objectives.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"“Please let me visit”: Management options for marine ecosystems in a Mediterranean Marine Protected Area.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/191723/","Tyllianakis, E","March 2022","Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as a means to support conservation of marine ecosystems is expected to depend on local communities and stakeholder’ participation and support. This paper presents the preferences of residents of Malta for measures intended to protect Posidonia oceanica seagrasses and coralligenous formations from threats from the anchoring and mooring of vessels in an offshore MPA area. The results indicate that only the most modest of restrictions increase the economic welfare of residents as participants are, overall, against further restrictions to enter the MPA. Survey participants wish to see an increase in provisioning ecosystem services such as fish caught and increases in carbon sequestration and are willing to pay to secure such benefits. Respondents also appear to have individualistic and use-driven values as a result of interacting with the MPA while past experiences play an important role in preferences, with frequent visitors strongly objecting to further restrictions to entry. The good current condition of the seagrass beds might explain the rejection of stringent restrictions but fails to account for threats from climate change and projected increase in tourism vessels’ visits. Such findings make co-operation and appropriate communication of threats and policies for management of marine resources through MPAs to the public more imperative.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"On Carbon Burial and Net Primary Production Through Earth’s History.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/182903/","Planavsky, NJ; Fakhraee, M; Bolton, EW","January 2022","The carbonate carbon isotope record has been traditionally interpreted as evidence of stability in the globally integrated ratio of organic to total carbon burial from Earth's surface environments over the past ∼3.8 billion years, but recent work has begun to question this conclusion. Herein, we use a reactive-transport modeling approach to track organic carbon oxidation at varying atmospheric oxygen levels and use that information to provide a rough estimate of net primary production through time. Our results support the emerging view that there was extensive variability in the fraction of carbon buried as organic matter (fb,org) throughout Earth's history. We strengthen the case that the carbonate carbon isotope record has been characterized by a relatively constant baseline value over time due to a fundamental mechanistic link between atmospheric O2 levels and the carbon isotope composition of net inputs to the ocean-atmosphere system. Further, using estimates of the organic carbon burial flux (Fb,org) and the burial efficiency of the carbon pump from our marine reactive-transport modeling, we also support previous work suggesting extensive fluctuation in marine net primary production over time.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Identifying where mariculture production occurs remains a major challenge for understanding its environmental impacts and the sustainability of individual farms and the sector as a whole. We compiled known mariculture locations and applied a simple production-allocation approach to map remaining global mariculture locations across 73 countries using the key determinants of distance to shore and ports, and average productivity (tonnage) of known farms. Our map represents 96% of reported fish and invertebrate mariculture production for 2017, but excludes algae which constitutes half of global mariculture production. We provide, for the first time, a publicly available spatial database of known and estimated mariculture locations. We discuss the utility and limitations of the existing data and our modeling approach, and highlight the key data gaps and future challenges for mapping aquaculture. Our results provide a vital resource for mariculture and environmental researchers, but we emphasize the need for a standardized, ground-truthed global spatial database of aquaculture locations and farm-level attributes (e.g., species, production type) to better understand the distribution of production and adequately plan for future growth.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Late Permian–Middle Triassic magnetostratigraphy in North China and its implications for terrestrial-marine correlations.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/186497/","Guo, W; Tong, J; He, Q","March 2022","A detailed magnetostratigraphic study, linked to a new latest Permian U–Pb ID-TIMS age, was undertaken on the continental Shichuanhe section (SCH) in North China in order to provide a magnetic polarity scale for the Late Permian–early Middle Triassic interval. Tilt-corrected mean directions of the characteristic remanent magnetization pass the reversal test and correspond to a site paleolatitude of 18.1°N during the Early Triassic, consistent with previous results from the North China Block. The magnetostratigraphy shows close similarity with previous studies, allowing interregional correlations with both marine and non-marine records. Normal magnetozone SCH3n, constrained by an absolute age of 252.21±0.15 Ma from an ash bed 3.5 m below its base, is unambiguously correlated to the earliest Triassic normal magnetochron LT1n. Our newly established magnetostratigraphic framework and published carbon-isotope chemostratigraphy, indicate that the Permian–Triassic Boundary is ca. 8 m above the base of SCH3n (within the middle part of the Sunjiagou Formation) at SCH. The overlying reverse polarity dominated interval (SCH3r–SCH5r) ranges to the middle Liujiagou Formation, and straddles an interval from the mid-Griesbachian to mid-Smithian. The base of the Olenekian is provisionally located in the lower part of the Liujiagou Formation, near the base of magnetozone SCH5n. The succeeding thick normal magnetozone SCH6n persists into the upper Heshanggou Formation, with the inferred Smithian–Spathian boundary located in the upper part of the Liujiagou Formation. The transition from reverse magnetozone SCH6r to the overlying normal magnetozone SCH7n, coincides with a clear erosional contact with the base of the Ermaying Formation. Consequently, magnetozone SCH7n is matched to the Early Anisian magnetochron MT3n, with the Olenekian–Anisian boundary interval missing. Our new timescale provides additional magnetostratigraphic constraints on the timing of the terrestrial ecological crisis in North China, which is found to lie within reverse magnetozone SCH2r (equivalent with reverse magnetochron LP3r), a level some 270±150 kyrs before the main marine extinction, that falls in the overlying normal magnetochron LT1n.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"An efficient procedure to predict the dynamic loads for piston liner systems in marine engines.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/171885/","Xiuyi, L; Azam, A; Yuechang, W","January 2021","The piston ring-cylinder liner (PRCL) is one of the most important parts of marine diesel engines and contributes 25% to 50% of total friction loss. The lubrication simulation analysis of the PRCL system is a challenging task. Complete understanding and precise prediction of lubrication loads is a key to understanding the friction behavior of PRCL systems as the accuracy of the friction prediction depends upon precise prediction of lubrication loads. Therefore, this paper focuses on the gas pressure calculation which is the primary source of lubrication loads. The procedure presented combines the advantages of two mainstream methods to predict loads in the PRCL system. The result is a significant reduction in the computation time without compromising on accuracy. Firstly, a comparison of both approaches is presented which suggests that each technique has its limitations (one is time-bound, and one is accuracy-bound). Then, the results from both calculation methods are verified against literature and a parametric study is performed to identify the key structural parameters of PRCL system that affect the calculation efficiency. Finally, a correlation coefficient is introduced into the analysis to combine the two approaches which then identifies the conditions under which the use of the faster method becomes invalid and replaces it with the more accurate approach. This ensures optimum performance of the calculation procedure by switching between the fast and the accurate method depending upon the accuracy requirement under given conditions, thereby, simplifying the dynamic and lubrication model of PRCL systems. The study has direct implications for the tribological design of the PRCL interface.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Identifying economic costs and knowledge gaps of invasive aquatic crustaceans.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/181373/","Kouba, A; Oficialdegui, FJ; Cuthbert, RN","December 2021","Despite voluminous literature identifying the impacts of invasive species, summaries of monetary costs for some taxonomic groups remain limited. Invasive alien crustaceans often have profound impacts on recipient ecosystems, but there may be great unknowns related to their economic costs. Using the InvaCost database, we quantify and analyse reported costs associated with invasive crustaceans globally across taxonomic, spatial, and temporal descriptors. Specifically, we quantify the costs of prominent aquatic crustaceans — crayfish, crabs, amphipods, and lobsters. Between 2000 and 2020, crayfish caused US$ 120.5 million in reported costs; the vast majority (99%) being attributed to representatives of Astacidae and Cambaridae. Crayfish-related costs were unevenly distributed across countries, with a strong bias towards European economies (US$ 116.4 million; mainly due to the signal crayfish in Sweden), followed by costs reported from North America and Asia. The costs were also largely predicted or extrapolated, and thus not based on empirical observations. Despite these limitations, the costs of invasive crayfish have increased considerably over the past two decades, averaging US$ 5.7 million per year. Invasive crabs have caused costs of US$ 150.2 million since 1960 and the ratios were again uneven (57% in North America and 42% in Europe). Damage-related costs dominated for both crayfish (80%) and crabs (99%), with management costs lacking or even more under-reported. Reported costs for invasive amphipods (US$ 178.8 thousand) and lobsters (US$ 44.6 thousand) were considerably lower, suggesting a lack of effort in reporting costs for these groups or effects that are largely non-monetised. Despite the well-known damage caused by invasive crustaceans, we identify data limitations that prevent a full accounting of the economic costs of these invasive groups, while highlighting the increasing costs at several scales based on the available literature. Further cost reports are needed to better assess the true magnitude of monetary costs caused by invasive aquatic crustaceans.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Here, we report iron speciation and trace metal data from the Bristol Channel Basin and Larne Basin of the NW European epicontinental sea (EES), spanning the Triassic–Jurassic (T–J) transition (~ 202–200 Ma). Results show frequent development of anoxic-ferruginous conditions, interspersed with ephemeral euxinic episodes in the Bristol Channel Basin during the latest Rhaetian, whereas the contemporaneous Larne Basin remained largely oxygenated, suggesting heterogeneous redox conditions between basins. Subsequently, more persistent euxinic conditions prevailed across the T–J boundary in both basins, coinciding precisely with the second phase of the ETME. We propose that this later phase of benthic faunal loss in the NW EES was directly driven by the bottom-water oxygen crisis. Conversely, although anoxic conditions persisted into the early Hettangian, the benthos diversified at this time in nearshore areas. Post-extinction conditions were poised at a fluctuating redox state, but anoxia did not extend into the shallowest areas where benthic marine ecosystem recovery was occurring.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Unifying approaches to Functional Marine Connectivity for improved marine resource management: the European SEA-UNICORN COST Action.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/189537/","Darnaude, A; Arnaud-Haond, S; Hunter, E","February 2022","Truly sustainable development in a human-altered, fragmented marine environment subject to unprecedented climate change, demands informed planning strategies in order to be successful. Beyond a simple understanding of the distribution of marine species, data describing how variations in spatio-temporal dynamics impact ecosystem functioning and the evolution of species are required. Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC) characterizes the flows of matter, genes and energy produced by organism movements and migrations across the seascape. As such, MFC determines the ecological and evolutionary interdependency of populations, and ultimately the fate of species and ecosystems. Gathering effective MFC knowledge can therefore improve predictions of the impacts of environmental change and help to refine management and conservation strategies for the seas and oceans. Gathering these data are challenging however, as access to, and survey of marine ecosystems still presents significant challenge. Over 50 European institutions currently investigate aspects of MFC using complementary methods across multiple research fields, to understand the ecology and evolution of marine species. The aim of SEA-UNICORN, a COST Action within the European Union Horizon 2020 framework programme, is to bring together this research effort, unite the multiple approaches to MFC, and to integrate these under a common conceptual and analytical framework. The consortium brings together a diverse group of scientists to collate existing MFC data, to identify knowledge gaps, to enhance complementarity among disciplines, and to devise common approaches to MFC. SEA-UNICORN will promote co-working between connectivity practitioners and ecosystem modelers to facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the predictive models used to identify marine conservation priorities. Ultimately, SEA-UNICORN will forge strong forward-working links between scientists, policy-makers and stakeholders to facilitate the integration of MFC knowledge into decision support tools for marine management and environmental policies.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"High-resolution volcanism-induced oceanic environmental change and its impact on organic matter accumulation in the Late Ordovician Upper Yangtze Sea.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/194726/","Lu, Y; Hao, F; Shen, J","December 2021","Volcanism is one of the most important geological processes that impact Earth's surface system. However, little is known about how a volcanic eruption in the past could cause environmental changes in the sea and its impact on organic matter (OM) accumulation due to the difficulties in gaining high-resolution sedimentary records. Here we conducted a high-resolution petrographic study and geochemical analyses including proxies reflecting the influx of volcanic and terrestrial material (Hg, Al, Fe, CIA), redox conditions (Mo, FeHR/FeT, FePy/FeHR), paleoproductivity (Baxs, Cuxs, Sixs), and biological variations (δ13Corg, δ15Norg) on a 25-cm long drilling core bracketing three cycles of volcanic activities from the Upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation in South China. This enables us to find, for the first time, the detailed process of environmental changes and different stages of OM accumulation induced by volcanism. Three nearly identical cycles have been identified, and each of them is comprised of a bentonite bed, a siliceous clay-rich mudstone interval, a radiolarian bed, and a siliceous mudstone interval with intercalations of thin pyrite. The marine redox condition shows the strongest anoxia and even euxinia on the eruption stage and began to decrease with the waning of the volcanic activities shown by Hg/TOC. The volcanic eruption will cause the microbial change that is likely reflecting the shift from nitrogen-fixation bacteria bloom to radiolarian bloom through the variation of bioavailable nitrate and some trace metals such as Cu. Of significance is that the volcanism-induced shift in microbial communities from prokaryotes to eukaryotes bloom is observed to impact the abundance of the sedimentary OM, a critical process leading to the wide occurrence of abundant oil and gas reservoirs in south China.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The isotopic composition of sedimentary organic zinc and implications for the global Zn isotope mass balance.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/187484/","Zhang, Y; Planavsky, NJ; Zhao, M","September 2021","Zinc (Zn) is a bioessential element whose cycling in the marine environment is closely linked to the biological pump. As a vital micronutrient, Zn is depleted in marine surface waters and enriched in deep waters. This has given rise to the longstanding hope that Zn could serve as a robust paleoproductivity proxy. There has been a recent focus on how Zn isotope signatures can be used to track the evolution of the biological pump. However, the factors controlling variations in the sedimentary Zn isotope composition of core-top sediments are debated and these values are influenced by changes in the relative contributions of biological uptake and scavenging processes and by mineral fractionations. In order to provide a new perspective on the Zn isotopic signature of marine core-top sediments and their potential for tracing ocean biogeochemical processes, we developed a sample preparation procedure to extract organically bound Zn (excluding inorganic Zn) without a significant isotope fractionation. We tested five potential organic solvents and found that the isopropanol extraction procedure provided a reproducible and robust result that yielded the highest recovery rate of organically bound Zn without a significant associated isotopic fractionation and appeared to exclude common mineral bound forms of Zn. This extraction procedure was used to analyze the Zn concentrations and isotopic compositions (δ66Zn) of core-top sediment samples from Long Island Sound and the Peruvian continental margin. Our results suggest that the δ66Zn value of organic Zn increases with water depth, thus providing additional support for the finding that burial of isotopically light Zn occurs predominantly in shallow high-productivity sediments. However, we also found that the δ66Zn values of the estimated authigenic Zn component are consistently lighter than those of the organic Zn fraction, consistent with diagenetic (sediment pile) scavenging of organic derived Zn in sulfides imparting an isotope fractionation.","Marine","University of Leeds"

This study combines contingent valuation and latent traits questions to derive the willingness of Indonesian respondents to support MPP mitigation initiatives. One and two-step models are compared to test the sensitivity of results to modelling assumptions. Latent traits help to understand the willingness to pay (WTP) for MPP and one and two-step approaches produce comparable results. On average respondents are willing to pay £15, per person, per year to reduce MPP, or 2% of the average monthly salary.

"Bioactive Trace Metals and Their Isotopes as Paleoproductivity Proxies: An Assessment Using GEOTRACES‐Era Data.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/195874/","Horner, TJ; Little, SH; Conway, TM","May 2021","Phytoplankton productivity and export sequester climatically significant quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide as particulate organic carbon through a suite of processes termed the biological pump. Constraining how the biological pump operated in the past is important for understanding past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and Earth's climate history. However, reconstructing the history of the biological pump requires proxies. Due to their intimate association with biological processes, several bioactive trace metals and their isotopes are potential proxies for past phytoplankton productivity, including iron, zinc, copper, cadmium, molybdenum, barium, nickel, chromium, and silver. Here, we review the oceanic distributions, driving processes, and depositional archives for these nine metals and their isotopes based on GEOTRACES-era datasets. We offer an assessment of the overall maturity of each isotope system to serve as a proxy for diagnosing aspects of past ocean productivity and identify priorities for future research. This assessment reveals that cadmium, barium, nickel, and chromium isotopes offer the most promise as tracers of paleoproductivity, whereas iron, zinc, copper, and molybdenum do not. Too little is known about silver to make a confident determination. Intriguingly, the trace metals that are least sensitive to productivity may be used to track other aspects of ocean chemistry, such as nutrient sources, particle scavenging, organic complexation, and ocean redox state. These complementary sensitivities suggest new opportunities for combining perspectives from multiple proxies that will ultimately enable painting a more complete picture of marine paleoproductivity, biogeochemical cycles, and Earth's climate history.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Codium fragile ssp. fragile is one of the most invasive species in the world. The species has deleterious impacts on marine ecosystems, but can also coexist with other Codium congeners, with neutral impact. Several invasive macroalgae have been described to occur along the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula, including C. fragile. However, despite its presence being noted in citizen science surveys, the occurrence of C. fragile on the coast of Portugal was not confirmed (except in the Azores Islands). The cryptic nature of this invasive macroalga has led to several misidentifications, and strict taxonomic approaches must therefore be used to confirm sightings. Previous intensive field sampling (2017–2018) aimed at recording the presence of different macroalgae did not find C. fragile along the Portuguese coast, northwards from Praia do Matadouro. Here, we report the first confirmed record of C. fragile on the coast of Portugal, in the Avencas Marine Park. Identification of the alga was confirmed by microscopic examination of the utricles. Early detection of invasive species is essential, and further research should be carried out in the surrounding areas in order to better understand the invasion pathways to enable correct application of management plans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Estimating benthic trophic levels to assess the effectiveness of marine protected area management.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174685/","Blanco, A; Beger, M; Planes, S","May 2021","Designating and managing marine protected areas (MPAs) can mitigate many ocean threats. Banning fishing activities within MPAs enhances the robustness of food-web dynamics and thus increases trophic resilience. Ecosystem function indicators, such as mean trophic level, are increasingly applied in conservation management. Stable isotope analysis is a common tool in trophodynamic studies as it provides information about food sources and trophic level within food webs. In contrast to the traditional top-down approaches in conservation management (mainly for fisheries), this study focuses on bottom-up responses to protection according to the target species in regional small-scale fisheries. The present study aimed to examine how MPA status affects trophodynamics in the rocky reefs of the Illas Atlánticas Marine-Terrestrial National Park (Galicia, NW Spain). Results showed no differences between inside and outside the MPA in species stable isotopic signatures or trophic level. However, these results should be considered with caution due to some limitations in the study design (small number of sites per location, biogeographic differences associated with the island nature of the MPA, or seasonal variability). Nevertheless, the lax fishing management, the lack of proper implementation (the MPA was established in 2002 without a management plan until 2019), and the small size of the studied MPA may result in ineffective conservation outcomes that could have been reflected in the stable isotopic content of the food web. The large number of “paper park” MPAs existing worldwide are not only detrimental to the perception of marine protection, but also provide poor protection of marine ecosystems. Subject to further studies accounting for both environmental and management factors on stable isotope signatures, trophic interactions can form a cost-effective tool for monitoring MPA effectiveness.","Marine","University of Leeds"

We tagged adult and juvenile gannets at the world's largest colony (Bass Rock) and reviewed two sources of survey data for different age classes to study their movements through southern North Sea waters. Tracked birds showed peak numbers in the southern North Sea in mid-October, with much smaller numbers there during November. Adults were distributed throughout the area, including waters close to OWFs, whereas juveniles were confined to the coast. Survey data indicated high proportions of immature gannets in southern North Sea waters, suggesting higher collision risk than for adults. Gannets present in November may be predominantly from colonies further north than Bass Rock.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Here we demonstrate the feasibility of sampling from commercial vessels (Mediterranean ferries) while underway, as a strategy to facilitate replicable, systematic marine eDNA surveys in locations that would normally be challenging and expensive for researchers to access. Sixteen eDNA samples were collected from four fixed sampling stations, and in response to four cetacean sightings, across three cruises undertaken along the 300 km ferry route between Livorno (Tuscany) and Golfo Aranci (Sardinia) in the Ligurian/Tyrrhenian Seas, June-July 2018. Using 12SrDNA and 16SrDNA metabarcoding markers, we recovered diverse marine vertebrate Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) from teleost fish, elasmobranchs, and cetaceans. We detected sample heterogeneity consistent with previously known variation in species occurrences, including putative species spawning peaks associated with specific sea surface temperature ranges, and increased night time abundance of bathypelagic species known to undertake diel migrations through the water column. We suggest commercial vessel based marine eDNA sampling using the global shipping network has potential to facilitate broad-scale biodiversity monitoring in the world’s oceans.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Controls on the cadmium isotope composition of modern marine sediments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/197429/","Bryan, AL; Dickson, AJ; Dowdall, F","April 2021","Continental margin sediments have been identified as the dominant sink in the marine budget of cadmium (Cd). The isotopic composition of this important output flux is, however, unknown. Here we present, with measurements on the Argentine continental margin, the first observational constraints on the isotopic composition of Cd in modern marine oxic and sub-oxic sediments. We identify two main removal mechanisms of Cd; in organic material, and by sulfide formation. Surface margin sediments (0–0.5 cm), with dissolved O2 below detection from ∼0.5 cm, are isotopically lighter than overlying oxygenated waters. A mass balance for these surface sediments indicates that Cd is present dominantly as organically-bound particulate Cd. In sub-surface sediments, Cd concentrations increase in the zone of nitrate reduction, and attain similar isotopic compositions as the water that overlies the sediment (i.e. ∼0.35‰ in deep waters). These observations are consistent with a downward diffusive flux of seawater Cd and redox-driven quantitative removal of that Cd during sulfide precipitation. In combination, these two routes of Cd removal lead to burial of isotopically light organic Cd in margin sub-oxic sediments that enables the global isotopic Cd budget to be balanced.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Thus, effective means of assessing and predicting the consequences of IAS predation on native prey population stability remains a vital goal for conservation. Here, we applied two classic ecological concepts, consumer functional response (FR) and prey switching, to predict and understand the ecological impacts of juveniles of the lionfish (Pterois volitans), a notorious and widespread marine invader. Functional responses and prey switching propensities were quantified towards three representative prey species: Artemia salina, Palaemonetes varians, and Gammarus oceanicus. Lionfish exhibited potentially destabilising Type II FRs towards individual prey species, owing to high consumption rates at low prey densities, whilst FR magnitudes differed among prey species. Functional response attack rates (a) were highest, and handling times (h) lowest, towards A. salina, followed by P. varians and then G. oceanicus. Maximum feeding rates (1/h) and functional response ratios (FRR; a/h) also followed this impact gradient for the three prey species. Lionfish, however, displayed a potentially population stabilising prey switching propensity (i.e. frequency-dependent predation) when multiple prey species were presented simultaneously, where disproportionately less of rare prey, and more of abundant prey, were consumed. Whilst FR and FRR magnitudes indicate marked per capita lionfish predatory impacts towards prey species, a strong prey switching propensity may reduce in-field impacts by offering low density prey refuge in biodiverse communities. Our results thus corroborate field patterns documenting variable impacts of lionfish, with prey extirpations less likely in diverse communities owing to frequency-dependent predation.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"The benefits of heterogeneity in spatial prioritisation within coral reef environments.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/174376/","Nolan, MKB; Kim, CJS; Hoegh-Guldberg, O","April 2021","Coral reefs are highly vulnerable habitats, threatened by climate change and local anthropogenic impacts. Management is imperative, and spatial prioritisation apportions the area of interest to inform investments of scarce conservation resources. Spatially delineated planning units used to make management decisions are typically large enough to contain significant natural variabilities, but the ecological significance of such variance is seldom considered in planning decisions. On coral reefs, the patchiness of habitat quality within planning units matters both ecologically and functionally. Here, we show that considering within-planning unit variance in spatial prioritisation influences the location and design of reserve networks. Studying Timor-Leste, we statistically model the average and variance in coral cover. We compare conservation priority areas for scenarios informed by coral cover and variance to a baseline scenario with the spatial prioritisation software Marxan. To further explain these differences, and to show the value of including coral variance as a metric in spatial prioritisation, we created a reserve quality score. We show that the similarity between reserve networks was only 57% for protection, and 44% for restoration objectives. For both objectives, the inclusion of cover variance improves the conservation benefit of management. This project has shown a novel way to target areas for restoration. These results demonstrate that not only is mean coral cover (and, by extension, reef condition) a key criterion in selecting marine conservation actions, but its variance must be considered in spatial conservation prioritisation to improve both the efficiency and benefit of management actions within marine reserve networks.","Marine","University of Leeds"

The sensitivity of marine species to climate change is increasingly being described with forecasted species distributions, yet these rarely account for population level processes such as genomic variation and local adaptation. This study compares inter- and intra-specific patterns of biological composition to determine how vulnerability to climate change, and its environmental drivers, vary across species and populations. We compare species trajectories for three ecologically important southern African marine invertebrates at two time points in the future, both at the species level, with correlative species distribution models, and at the population level, with gradient forest models. Reported range shifts are species-specific and include both predicted range gains and losses. Forecasted species responses to climate change are strongly influenced by changes in a suite of environmental variables, from sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature, to minimum air temperature. Our results further suggest a mismatch between future habitat suitability (where species can remain in their ecological niche) and genomic vulnerability (where populations retain their genomic composition), highlighting the inter- and intraspecific variability in species' sensitivity to global change. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of considering species and population level climatic vulnerability when proactively managing coastal marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Experimental evaluation of the extractability of Fe-bound organic carbon in sediments as a function of carboxyl content.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/164864/","Fisher, BJ; Moore, OW; Faust, JC","August 2020","The majority of organic carbon (OC) burial in marine sediments occurs on continental shelves, of which an estimated 10–20% is associated with reactive iron (FeR). The association of OC with FeR (OC-FeR) is thought to facilitate preservation of organic matter (OM) in sediments and therefore represents an important carbon sink. The citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite (CBD) method is used to quantify OC-FeR in marine sediments by reductively dissolving FeR, thereby releasing bound OC. While the CBD method is widely used, it may be less efficient at measuring OC-FeR than currently thought, due to the incomplete reduction of FeR, resulting from the neutral pH conditions required to prevent OM hydrolysis. Additionally, the typical range of values reported for OC-FeR in marine sediments is narrow, despite variation in OM and FeR inputs, OM source types and chemical compositions. This suggests a limitation exists on the amount of OC that can become associated with FeR, and/or that the CBD method is limited in the OC-FeR that it is able to quantify. In assessing the efficiency of the CBD method, we aimed to understand whether methodological errors or (mis)interpretation of these extraction results may contribute to the apparent limitation on OC-FeR values. Here, we synthesised OC-FeR composites with a known FeR phase and known OM moieties, varying in carboxyl content, at neutral pH. These were spiked into OC-free marine sediment, and subject to a CBD extraction to investigate i) the efficiency of CBD for OC extraction; ii) the efficiency of CBD for FeR extraction; ii) how the OC moiety affects the physical parameters of associated FeR minerals; and iii) the impact of OM moiety on OC and Fe release. We show that the CBD method results in only partial dissolution of the most susceptible FeR phase (ferrihydrite) and therefore incomplete removal of bound OC. While as little as ~20% of Fe is released from OC-free ferrihydrite, structural disorder of the mineral phase increases with the inclusion of more OC, resulting in greater losses of up to 62% Fe for carboxyl rich OC-FeR complexes. In addition, our results show that the NaCl control step performed in the CBD method is capable of removing weakly bound OC from FeR, such that inclusion of this OC in the total OC-FeR fraction may increase marine sediments OC-FeR estimates by ~33%. Finally, we suggest that the structure of OC involved in OC-FeR binding can affect quantification of the OC-FeR pool. Our results have important implications for assessing the FeR bound OC fraction in marine sediments and the fate of this OC in the global carbon cycle.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency. It can be concluded that the integrated multi-pollutant treatment for ship emissions holds great promise.","Marine","University of Leeds"
"Does Arctic warming reduce preservation of organic matter in Barents Sea sediments?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/162662/","Faust, JC; Stevenson, MA; Abbott, GD","June 2020","Over the last few decades, the Barents Sea experienced substantial warming, an expansion of relatively warm Atlantic water and a reduction in sea ice cover. This environmental change forces the entire Barents Sea ecosystem to adapt and restructure and therefore changes in pelagic–benthic coupling, organic matter sedimentation and long-term carbon sequestration are expected. Here we combine new and existing organic and inorganic geochemical surface sediment data from the western Barents Sea and show a clear link between the modern ecosystem structure, sea ice cover and the organic carbon and CaCO3 contents in Barents Sea surface sediments. Furthermore, we discuss the sources of total and reactive iron phases and evaluate the spatial distribution of organic carbon bound to reactive iron. Consistent with a recent global estimate we find that on average 21.0 ± 8.3 per cent of the total organic carbon is associated to reactive iron (fOC-FeR) in Barents Sea surface sediments. The spatial distribution of fOC-FeR, however, seems to be unrelated to sea ice cover, Atlantic water inflow or proximity to land. Future Arctic warming might, therefore, neither increase nor decrease the burial rates of iron-associated organic carbon. However, our results also imply that ongoing sea ice reduction and the associated alteration of vertical carbon fluxes might cause accompanied shifts in the Barents Sea surface sedimentary organic carbon content, which might result in overall reduced carbon sequestration in the future.","Marine","University of Leeds"

Ameloblastin (AMBN), the second most abundant enamel matrix protein (EMP), plays a critical role in amelogenesis. Pathogenic biallelic loss-of-function AMBN variants are known to cause recessive hypoplastic AI. A report of a family with dominant hypoplastic AI attributed to AMBN missense change p.Pro357Ser, together with data from animal models, suggests that the consequences of AMBN variants in human AI remain incompletely characterized. Here we describe 5 new pathogenic AMBN variants in 11 individuals with AI. These fall within 3 groups by phenotype. Group 1, consisting of 6 families biallelic for combinations of 4 different variants, have yellow hypoplastic AI with poor-quality enamel, consistent with previous reports. Group 2, with 2 families, appears monoallelic for a variant shared with group 1 and has hypomaturation AI of near-normal enamel volume with pitting. Group 3 includes 3 families, all monoallelic for a fifth variant, which are affected by white hypoplastic AI with a thin intact enamel layer. Three variants, c.209C&gt;G; p.(Ser70*) (groups 1 and 2), c.295T&gt;C; p.(Tyr99His) (group 1), and c.76G&gt;A; p.(Ala26Thr) (group 3) were identified in multiple families. Long-read AMBN locus sequencing revealed these variants are on the same conserved haplotype, implying they originate from a common ancestor. Data presented therefore provide further support for possible dominant as well as recessive inheritance for AMBN-related AI and for multiple contrasting phenotypes. In conclusion, our findings suggest pathogenic AMBN variants have a more complex impact on human AI than previously reported. </jats:p>","AI","University of Leeds"
"Camera Phantasma: Reframing virtual photographies in the age of AI.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/206292/","Schofield, M.P.","November 2023","The recent advent of virtual photography and artificial intelligence (specifically AI photography and diffusion models), presents a major challenge to both photographers and photography theory. All our common-sense assumptions about the ontology of the image now seem to be falling apart. Are these interlopers really photography? Can we hear the final death knell for the erstwhile medium in this era of ever-increasing media convergence and virtualisation? This practice-led investigation of these new media forms draws on the author’s recent creative work in virtual photographies, and similar interventions by other photographers and new media artists, seeking to augment and expand their practice using these new tools, whilst querying what photography really means today. From in-game photography to virtual exploration using Google Street View, to AI photography using the latest denoising diffusion models (such as Midjourney), there are surprising commonalities to explore between them, linking these new practices of image-making firmly back to traditions of lens-based photography. Rather than seeking a detailed map of this difficult new terrain, or a definitive ontology of emerging virtual photographies, the author reframes the discourse around practice, examining both photography as an evolving set of practices and also notions of media hauntology – specifically the spectral ways in which new media technologies are always haunted by prior practices and modes of communication. The importance of the frame to both traditional photography and new practices of virtual photography, is suggested as a vital and persistent dimension in photographic authorship. With that authorship increasingly contested by new generative methods, easy appropriation and AI image-making, the act of framing may become the best litmus test we have, for whether or not a photograph should be considered ‘real’ or valued.","AI","University of Leeds"
"Domain randomization using synthetic electrocardiograms for training neural networks.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201050/","Kaisti, M; Laitala, J; Wong, D","May 2023","We present a method for training neural networks with synthetic electrocardiograms that mimic signals produced by a wearable single lead electrocardiogram monitor. We use domain randomization where the synthetic signal properties such as the waveform shape, RR-intervals and noise are varied for every training example. Models trained with synthetic data are compared to their counterparts trained with real data. Detection of r-waves in electrocardiograms recorded during different physical activities and in atrial fibrillation is used to assess the performance. By allowing the randomization of the synthetic signals to increase beyond what is typically observed in the real-world data the performance is on par or superseding the performance of networks trained with real data. Experiments show robust model performance using different seeds and on different unseen test sets that were fully separated from the training phase. The ability of the model to generalize well to hidden test sets without any specific tuning provides a simple and explainable alternative to more complex adversarial domain adaptation methods for model generalization. This method opens up the possibility of extending the use of synthetic data towards domain insensitive cardiac disease classification when disease specific a priori information is used in the electrocardiogram generation. Additionally, the method provides training with free-to-collect data with accurate labels, control of the data distribution eliminating class imbalances that are typically observed in health-related data, and the generated data is inherently private.","AI","University of Leeds"
"How convincing are AI-generated moral arguments for climate action?","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/201347/","Nisbett, N; Spaiser, V","June 2023","Mobilizing broad support for climate action is paramount for solving the climate crisis. Research suggests that people can be persuaded to support climate action when presented with certain moral arguments, but which moral arguments are most convincing across the population? With this pilot study, we aim to understand which types of moral arguments based on an extended Moral Foundation Theory are most effective at convincing people to support climate action. Additionally, we explore to what extent Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) models can be employed to generate bespoke moral statements. We find statements appealing to compassion, fairness and good ancestors are the most convincing to participants across the population, including to participants, who identify as politically right-leaning and who otherwise respond least to moral arguments. Negative statements appear to be more convincing than positive ones. Statements appealing to other moral foundations can be convincing, but only to specific social groups. GPT-3-generated statements are generally more convincing than human-generated statements, but the large language model struggles with creating novel arguments.","AI","University of Leeds"

"Speculative Futures on ChatGPT and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI): A collective reflection from the educational landscape.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/199211/","Boskurt, A; Xiao, J; Lamber, S","March 2023","While ChatGPT has recently become very popular, AI has a long history and philosophy. This paper intends to explore the promises and pitfalls of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) AI and potentially future technologies by adopting a speculative methodology. Speculative future narratives with a specific focus on educational contexts are provided in  an attempt to  identify emerging themes and discuss their implications for education in the 21st century. Affordances of (using) AI in Education (AIEd)and possible adverse effects are identified and discussed which emerge from the narratives. It is argued that now is the best of times to define human vs AI contribution to education because AI can accomplish more and more educational activities that used to be the prerogative of human educators. Therefore,  it  is  imperative  to  rethink  the  respective  roles  of  technology  and  human  educators  in education with a future-oriented mindset.","AI","University of Leeds"

"Is it time for robot rights? Moral status in artificial entities.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/180887/","Müller, VC","April 2021","Some authors have recently suggested that it is time to consider rights for robots. These suggestions are based on the claim that the question of robot rights should not depend on a standard set of conditions for ‘moral status’; but instead, the question is to be framed in a new way, by rejecting the is/ought distinction, making a relational turn, or assuming a methodological behaviourism. We try to clarify these suggestions and to show their highly problematic consequences. While we find the suggestions ultimately unmotivated, the discussion shows that our epistemic condition with respect to the moral status of others does raise problems, and that the human tendency to empathise with things that do not have moral status should be taken seriously—we suggest that it produces a “derived moral status”. Finally, it turns out that there is typically no individual in real AI that could even be said to be the bearer of moral status. Overall, there is no reason to think that robot rights are an issue now.","AI","University of Leeds"
"Spectrum of pathogenic variants and founder effects in amelogenesis imperfecta associated with MMP20.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/180540/","Nikolopoulos, G; Smith, CEL; Poulter, JA","February 2021","Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) describes a heterogeneous group of developmental enamel defects that typically have Mendelian inheritance. Exome sequencing of 10 families with recessive hypomaturation AI revealed four novel and one known variants in the matrix metallopeptidase 20 (MMP20) gene that were predicted to be pathogenic. MMP20 encodes a protease that cleaves the developing extracellular enamel matrix and is necessary for normal enamel crystal growth during amelogenesis. New homozygous missense changes were shared between four families of Pakistani heritage (c.625G>C; p.(Glu209Gln)) and two of Omani origin (c.710C>A; p.(Ser237Tyr)). In two families of UK origin and one from Costa Rica, affected individuals were homozygous for the previously reported c.954-2A>T; p.(Ile319Phefs*19) variant. For each of these variants, microsatellite haplotypes appeared to exclude a recent founder effect, but elements of haplotype were conserved, suggesting more distant founding ancestors. New compound heterozygous changes were identified in one family of the European heritage: c.809_811+12delinsCCAG; p.(?) and c.1122A>C; p.(Gln374His). This report further elucidates the mutation spectrum of MMP20 and the probable impact on protein function, confirms a consistent hypomaturation phenotype and shows that mutations in MMP20 are a common cause of autosomal recessive AI in some communities.","AI","University of Leeds"
"Diversification in the age of the 4th industrial revolution: The role of artificial intelligence, green bonds and cryptocurrencies.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/184080/","Huynh, TLD; Hille, E; Nasir, MA","June 2020","In the context of the 4th industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental challenges, this study investigates the role of AI, robotics stocks and green bonds in portfolio diversification. Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification. The NASDAQ AI and general equity indexes are not good hedging instruments for each other.","AI","University of Leeds"
"Collective Learning: A 10-Year Odyssey to Human-centered Distributed Intelligence.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/172733/","Pournaras, E","June 2020","This paper illustrates a 10-year research endeavor on collective learning, a paradigm for tackling tragedy of the commons problems in socio-technical systems using human-centered distributed intelligence. In contrast to mainstream centralized artificial intelligence (AI) allowing algorithmic discrimination and manipulative nudging, the decentralized approach of collective learning is by-design participatory and value-sensitive: it aligns with privacy, autonomy, fairness and democratic values. Engineering such values in a socio-technical system results in computational constraints that turn collective decision-making into complex combinatorial NP-hard problems. These are the problems that collective learning and the EPOS research project tackles. Collective learning finds striking applicability in energy, traffic, supply-chain and the self-management of sharing economies. This grand applicability and the social impact are demonstrated in this paper along with a future perspective of the collective learning paradigm.","AI","University of Leeds"
"Cognition-enabled robotic wiping: Representation, planning, execution, and interpretation.","https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/144535/","Leidner, D; Bartels, G; Bejjani, W","November 2018","Advanced cognitive capabilities enable humans to solve even complex tasks by representing and processing internal models of manipulation actions and their effects. Consequently, humans are able to plan the effect of their motions before execution and validate the performance afterwards. In this work, we derive an analog approach for robotic wiping actions which are fundamental for some of the most frequent household chores including vacuuming the floor, sweeping dust, and cleaning windows. We describe wiping actions and their effects based on a qualitative particle distribution model. This representation enables a robot to plan goal-oriented wiping motions for the prototypical wiping actions of absorbing, collecting and skimming. The particle representation is utilized to simulate the task outcome before execution and infer the real performance afterwards based on haptic perception. This way, the robot is able to estimate the task performance and schedule additional motions if necessary. We evaluate our methods in simulated scenarios, as well as in real experiments with the humanoid service robot Rollin’ Justin.","AI","University of Leeds"

This has to change. In this paper we discuss the issues that can raise from biases introduced in autonomous systems, with specific care of the case of machine learning systems, and their impact on our society. In the light of the (current and future) exploitation of autonomous systems for law enforcement and war – fighting, we emphasise the importance of issues related to discrimination and safety. We also support the bold claim that artificial intelligence can help artificial intelligence in overcoming those issues: by enabling artificial intelligence to record every single step that lead to a given inference, and to argue with humans, we can unveil the mystic oracle and trust its services.","AI","University of Leeds"
