Existing approaches assume that goal hypotheses comprise a single conjunctive formula over a single final state and that the environment dynamics are deterministic, preventing the recognition of temporally extended goals in more complex settings. In this paper, we expand goal recognition to temporally extended goals in Fully Observable Non-Deterministic (FOND) planning domain models, focusing on goals on finite traces expressed in Linear Temporal Logic (LTLf) and Pure Past Linear Temporal Logic (PLTLf). We develop the first approach capable of recognizing goals in such settings and evaluate it using different LTLf and PLTLf goals over six FOND planning domain models. Empirical results show that our approach is accurate in recognizing temporally extended goals in different recognition settings.     ","AI","University of Aberdeen"

"Self-Supervised Adversarial Imitation Learning","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/21527","Monteiro, Juarez; Gavenski, Nathan; Meneguzzi, Felipe; Barros, Rodrigo C.","April 2023"," Abstract:Behavioural cloning is an imitation learning technique that teaches an agent how to behave via expert demonstrations. Recent approaches use self-supervision of fully-observable unlabelled snapshots of the states to decode state pairs into actions. However, the iterative learning scheme employed by these techniques is prone to get trapped into bad local minima. Previous work uses goal-aware strategies to solve this issue. However, this requires manual intervention to verify whether an agent has reached its goal. We address this limitation by incorporating a discriminator into the original framework, offering two key advantages and directly solving a learning problem previous work had. First, it disposes of the manual intervention requirement. Second, it helps in learning by guiding function approximation based on the state transition of the expert's trajectories. Third, the discriminator solves a learning issue commonly present in the policy model, which is to sometimes perform a `no action' within the environment until the agent finally halts.

In addition to deformation and view-dependent lighting, tubular structures like the colon present problems stemming from their self-occluding and repetitive anatomical structure. In this paper, we propose SimCol, a synthetic dataset for camera pose estimation in colonoscopy, and a novel method that explicitly learns a bimodal distribution to predict the endoscope pose. Our dataset replicates real colonoscope motion and highlights the drawbacks of existing methods. We publish 18k RGB images from simulated colonoscopy with corresponding depth and camera poses and make our data generation environment in Unity publicly available. We evaluate different camera pose prediction methods and demonstrate that, when trained on our data, they generalize to real colonoscopy sequences, and our bimodal approach outperforms prior unimodal work.

More precisely we are investigating properties of a utility-based model that will govern a robot's actions. The novelty of this approach lies in embedding the responsibility of the robot over the state of affairs into the utility model via a utility aggregation function. We describe desiderata for such a function and consider related properties.     ","AI","University of Aberdeen"
"Analytical Solutions for the Inverse Problem within Gradual Semantics","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/19104","Oren, Nir; Yun, Bruno; Libman, Assaf; Baptista, Murilo","February 2022"," Abstract:Gradual semantics within abstract argumentation associate a numeric score with every argument in a system, which represents the level of acceptability of this argument, and from which a preference ordering over arguments can be derived. While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks, many utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associated with each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradual semantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentation framework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentation framework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, and identifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtain the desired preference ordering. Existing work has attacked the inverse problem numerically, using a root finding algorithm (the bisection method) to identify appropriate initial weights. In this paper we demonstrate that for a class of gradual semantics, an analytical approach can be used to solve the inverse problem. Unlike the current state-of-the-art, such an analytic approach can rapidly find a solution, and is guaranteed to do so. In obtaining this result, we are able to prove several important properties which previous work had posed as conjectures.     ","AI","University of Aberdeen"
"The Inverse Problem for Argumentation Gradual Semantics","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/21380","Oren, Nir; Yun, Bruno; Vesic, Srdjan; Baptista, Murilo","January 2022"," Abstract:Gradual semantics with abstract argumentation provide each argument with a score reflecting its acceptability, i.e. how ""much"" it is attacked by other arguments. Many different gradual semantics have been proposed in the literature, each following different principles and producing different argument rankings. A sub-class of such semantics, the so-called weighted semantics, takes, in addition to the graph structure, an initial set of weights over the arguments as input, with these weights affecting the resultant argument ranking. In this work, we consider the inverse problem over such weighted semantics. That is, given an argumentation framework and a desired argument ranking, we ask whether there exist initial weights such that a particular semantics produces the given ranking. The contribution of this paper are: (1) an algorithm to answer this problem, (2) a characterisation of the properties that a gradual semantics must satisfy for the algorithm to operate, and (3) an empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

"On the Latent Holes of VAEs for Text Generation","https://aura.abdn.ac.uk//handle/2164/18658","Li, Ruizhe; Peng, Xutan; Lin, Chenghua","July 2021"," Abstract:In this paper, we provide the first focused study on the discontinuities (aka. holes) in the latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), a phenomenon which has been shown to have a detrimental effect on model capacity. When investigating latent holes, existing works are exclusively centred around the encoder network and they merely explore the existence of holes. We tackle these limitations by proposing a highly efficient Tree-based Decoder-Centric (TDC) algorithm for latent hole identification, with a focal point on the text domain. In contrast to past studies, our approach pays attention to the decoder network, as a decoder has a direct impact on the model's output quality. Furthermore, we provide, for the first time, in-depth empirical analysis of the latent hole phenomenon, investigating several important aspects such as how the holes impact VAE algorithms' performance on text generation, and how the holes are distributed in the latent space.
