Between 2012 and 2016 the US invested $18.2 billion into AI compared with $2.6 billion in China. This chapter presents an analysis of AI in China and the West. China, the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU) have adopted a government‐led approach to AI. The United States’ (US) AI strategy has been dominated (and self‐regulated) by big tech companies. Singapore's AI structure emphasizes a more “human‐centric” approach that includes explainability, transparency and fairness to establish public trust in AI. China outpaces the US in terms of both deep learning and AI‐related patent publications, and the gap is closing for machine learning‐related patent publications. The US companies focus on machine learning, speech recognition and speech synthesis, whereas the Chinese ones focus on AI searching and facial recognition.","Tech","University of Surrey"

"Valuation of Marine Plastic Pollution in the European Arctic: Applying an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable Model to Contingent Valuation","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Valuation-of-Marine-Plastic-Pollution-in/99514973202346?institution=44SUR_INST","Tenaw G. Abate; Tobias Borger; Margrethe Aanesen; Jannike Falk-Andersson; Kayleigh Wyles; Nicola Beaumont","03/2020","Despite its remoteness, marine plastic pollution is a significant environmental problem in the Arctic. In Svalbard, for example, plastics are found on the shorelines, in the water column, on the ocean floor and in the ice. Organisms have been observed to be entangled in nets and ingestion of plastics has been documented in a range of organisms. Notably almost all Arctic bird species have been found to have ingested plastic, with Northern fulmars being particularly affected, with 89% of samples recorded as having ingested plastic. Identification and valuation of ecosystem services affected by marine plastic pollution can provide input for decision makers in evaluating and comparing management policies concerning this unique environment. This study employs the contingent valuation method (CVM) for eliciting the willingness to pay (WTP) of Norwegian households for reducing marine plastic pollution around the archipelago of Svalbard. An Integrated Choice and Latent Variable model (ICLV) is employed to explore attitudinal determinants of WTP. We find an average WTP for an initiative to reduce marine plastics of NOK 5,485 (USD 642) per household per year. The ICLV results reveal that people who are relatively more concerned about marine plastic pollution and who deem the proposed initiative effective are willing to pay more (up to 85 % and 50 %, respectively). The use of ICLV models in CVM and recommendations for future research are discussed.","Marine","University of Surrey"

At this purpose, the algorithm proposed uses a combination of image processing techniques in order to identify ships exclusively by detecting the wakes they leave behind. Once a ship is identified, its position in the image, its heading and its speed are determined. The algorithm was developed and tested on SAR imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Sentinel-1. Here the algorithm's design and testing results are presented and its performance discussed with regard to the overall ship detection and the wake's components recognition. The algorithm resulted in a correct ship detection in 95% of the cases tested and in a correct recognition of the wakes' components in more than 80% of the cases analysed.","Marine","University of Surrey"
"Species-specific behaviours in amphipods highlight the need for understanding baseline behaviours in ecotoxicology","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Species-specific-behaviours-in-amphipods-highlight-the/99706036402346?institution=44SUR_INST","Shanelle A. Kohler; Matthew O. Parker; Alex T. Ford","01/09/2018","Behavioural studies in ecotoxicology are increasing with techniques and endpoints used in pharmacology being translated to other vertebrate and invertebrate species. Despite this, data on the baseline behaviours of model organisms, and inter-species variability in behaviour are currently under-studied. This study assessed a range of behaviours associated with anxiety including swimming speed, phototaxis and thigmotaxis in a marine and freshwater amphipod (Echinogammarus marinas and Gammarus pulex). Differences in sensitivity to these assays were observed between species with E. marinus showing a greater sensitivity to the phototaxis assay than G. pulex, while in thigmotaxis assays G. pulex appeared better suited than E. marinus for measuring differences in the use of central zones. Significant inter-species differences were also observed in swimming patterns when breaking the data into ten second time bins but not when data was broken into two-minute time bins. The results of this study provide evidence of phototactic and thigmotactic behaviours in two model crustacean species with potential for use in behavioural ecotoxicology. Inter-species variability in sensitivity to behavioural assays highlights the importance of systematic assessment of baseline responses for all model species used in behavioural studies. Careful analysis of data is also required when performing behavioural studies so as not to lose sensitivity in your data.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Through the lens of psychosocial identity, qualitative data analysis from interviews with current and previous fishers in Cornwall shows how people are deconstructing and reconstructing their identities in the transition from fishing to tourism work, and that experiences of marine tourism diversification are dynamic, multifaceted, and embedded in social encounters. This article expands current discussions on work transitions by giving insight into the lived experiences of marine tourism operators from a psychosocial perspective, to go beyond the dominant economic narrative of diversification and social change, which has implications on how transitions into tourism work are facilitated.","Marine","University of Surrey"
"Blockchain application in circular marine plastic debris management","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Blockchain-application-in-circular-marine-plastic/99768062702346?institution=44SUR_INST","Yu Gong; Yang Wang; Regina Frei; Bill Wang; Changping Zhao","2022","The threat to the environment and humanity caused by marine plastic debris has aroused global attention. This research aims to explore the feasibility of applying blockchain technology (BCT) in marine plastic debris management. A case study on three pioneer recycling organizations is conducted based on secondary data. The study found that BCT can be applied to solve some of the existing challenges of marine plastic debris management. A digital token system and identity recognition mechanism based on BCT can increase the public awareness for marine plastic debris governance. The derived digital wallets and distributed ledgers can effectively replace paper documents and cash transactions in the traditional recycling chain, and minimize global impact on local economies, thus improve efficiency and safety. Also, the traceability and high transparency of blockchain and the application of smart contracts can effectively build a global recycling network. In addition, the application of BCT can greatly improve the transparency of recycling value chains, and make them more accepting of supervision from society and consumers. This research is one of the first studies on BCT in marine plastic debris management and explores worldwide pioneering companies. In practice, this study can help companies analyse the defects in their own waste disposal models and help practitioners make decisions to adopt BCT. In academia, as one of the early exploratory studies on the application of BCT to the treatment of marine plastic debris, this study provides further empirical reference on BCT based business models and recycling chains, and can guide future research in this field.","Marine","University of Surrey"
"Can Beach Cleans Do More Than Clean-Up Litter?

Volunteer beach cleans help address this issue, but may only have limited, local impact. Consequently, it is important to study any broader benefits associated with beach cleans. This article examines the well-being and educational value of beach cleans, as well as their impacts on individuals’ behavioral intentions. We conducted an experimental study that allocated students (n = 90) to a beach cleaning, rock pooling, or walking activity. All three coastal activities were associated with positive mood and pro-environmental intentions. Beach cleaning and rock pooling were associated with higher marine awareness. The unique impacts of beach cleaning were that they were rated as most meaningful but linked to lower restorativeness ratings of the environment compared with the other activities. This research highlights the interplay between environment and activities, raising questions for future research on the complexities of person-environment interactions.","Marine","University of Surrey"

First, the improved nonlocal means denoising algorithm is used to denoise the underwater image. The combination of Gaussian weighted spatial distance and Gaussian weighted Euclidean distance is used as the index of nonlocal means denoising algorithm to measure the similarity of structural blocks. The improved algorithm can retain more edge features and texture information while maintaining noise reduction ability. Then, the improved U-Net is used for color correction. Introducing residual structure and attention mechanism into U-Net can effectively enhance feature extraction ability and prevent network degradation. Finally, a sharpening algorithm based on maximum a posteriori is proposed to enhance the image after color correction, which can increase the detailed information of the image without expanding the noise. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a remarkable effect on underwater image enhancement.","Marine","University of Surrey"

Bradley","03/2019","Although the various benefits of seaweeds are well recognised, potential health hazards are much less well researched, as an instance the possible presence of concentrated levels of natural radionuclides. In present work the concentrations of natural radionuclides in seaweed cultivated in Malaysian seas are assessed using conventional HPGe γ-ray spectrometry. An edible species of seaweed has been collected from several seaweed farms located along coasts of the Andaman and South China Sea. Activity concentrations of 226Ra, 228Ra and 40K in samples collected from Langkawi are observed to be greater than those from Sabah, while 40K radioactivity levels (2.2E3 ± 100 – 3.8E3 ± 180 Bq kg−1) in all samples are noted to be well above the world average value of between 400 and 580 Bq kg−1. The estimated amount of total potassium is in the range 68 – 120 g (kg of seaweed)−1 and 53–106 g kg−1 obtained via ICP-OES, which are in line with data for New Zealand seaweed of between 43.7 and 123 g kg−1. The estimated total effective dose of 84 μSv·y−1 is lower compared to a global internal dose of 290 μSv·y−1 as reported by UNSCEAR. Accordingly, the mean cancer risk from such consumption was also estimated to be slightly lower (1.92 × 10−3) compared to the ICRP cancer risk factor of 2.5 × 10−3 based on the additional annual dose limit of 1 mSv for a member of the general public, which gives an annual mortality probability of 10−5 (1 in 100,000; ICRP, 1991). Although posing a low risk health hazard, periodic monitoring of natural radioactivity in foodstuff remains important in seeking to ensure the radiological safety of the public. •Activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in edible seaweeds were determined.•Radioactivity of 40K in all samples is well above the world average value.•Committed effective dose and lifetime cancer risk for humans were estimated.•Seaweed consumption with the current rate posing a low risk to public health","Marine","University of Surrey"

The autoencoder (AE) and self-supervised learning based methods are two mainstream methods. However, the AE-based methods could be limited as the feature learned from normal sounds can also fit with anomalous sounds, reducing the ability of the model in detecting anomalies from sound. The self-supervised methods are not always stable and perform differently, even for machines of the same type. In addition, the anomalous sound may be short-lived, making it even harder to distinguish from normal sound. This paper proposes an ID-constrained Transformer-based autoencoder (IDC-TransAE) architecture with weighted anomaly score computation for unsupervised ASD. Machine ID is employed to constrain the latent space of the Transformer-based autoencoder (TransAE) by introducing a simple ID classifier to learn the difference in the distribution for the same machine type and enhance the ability of the model in distinguishing anomalous sound. Moreover, weighted anomaly score computation is introduced to highlight the anomaly scores of anomalous events that only appear for a short time. Experiments performed on DCASE 2020 Challenge Task2 development dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.","AI","University of Surrey"

Very little is known about these newly-created working environments and their effects on cognition. The present study focused on a novel practice, interlingual respeaking (IRSP), where real-time subtitles in another language are created through the interaction between a human and ASR software. To this end, we set up an experiment that included a purpose-made training course on IRSP over 5 weeks, investigating its effects on cognition, and focusing on executive functioning (EF) and working memory (WM). We compared the cognitive performance of 51 language professionals before and after the course. Our variables were reading span (a complex WM measure), switching skills, and sustained attention. IRSP training course improved complex WM and switching skills but not sustained attention. However, the participants were slower after the training, indicating increased vigilance with the sustained attention tasks. Finally, complex WM was confirmed as the primary competence in IRSP. The reasons and implications of these findings will be discussed.","AI","University of Surrey"

To handle potential sketch ambiguity, our method creates multiple 3D shapes that align with the original sketch’s structure. We carefully design our method, training the model step-by-step and leveraging multi-modal 3D shape representation to support training with limited training data.

In interactions with AI-driven chatbots, user repair addresses chatbots' lack of understanding or misunderstanding of the user's intent. This paper represents a user-centred description of user repair strategies in interactions with a task-oriented chatbot. It is based on the analysis of simulated user interactions with a chatbot facilitating health appointment bookings. The analysis shows that the repair strategies which users draw on most frequently (e.g., rephrasing) are not necessarily the ones which prompt the bot to correctly recognise intent and provide relevant responses, whereas the less frequently used self-repair strategies (e.g. restating the intent) are more successful in achieving intent recognition. This suggest that the rules of interaction with conversational AI need to be made explicit to users as they lack familiarity with the context, limitations and patterning of interactions facilitated through AI. •When bots misunderstand or do not understand user intent, users perform repair.•Repair strategies used include e.g., rephrasing, repetition, accommodation.•Users transfer repair strategies from human interaction into bot interactions.•Users deploy the more successful repair strategies less frequently and vice versa.•The rules of communication with conversational AI need to be made more explicit.","AI","University of Surrey"
"Explainable Deep Learning Approach for Multilabel Classification of Antimicrobial Resistance with Missing Labels","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Explainable-Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Multilabel/99695564302346?institution=44SUR_INST","Mukunthan Tharmakulasingam; Brian Gardner; Roberto La Ragione; Anil Fernando","25/10/2022","Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) from genomic sequence data has become a significant component of overcoming the AMR challenge, especially given its potential for facilitating more rapid diagnostics and personalised antibiotic treatments. With the recent advances in sequencing technologies and computing power, deep learning models for genomic sequence data have been widely adopted to predict AMR more reliably and error-free. There are more than 30 different types of AMR; therefore, any practical AMR prediction system must be able to identify multiple AMRs present in a genomic sequence. Unfortunately, most genomic sequence datasets do not have all the labels marked, thereby making a deep learning modelling approach challenging owing to its reliance on labels for reliability and accuracy. This paper addresses this issue by presenting an effective deep learning solution, Mask-Loss 1D convolution neural network (ML-ConvNet), for AMR prediction on datasets with many missing labels. The core component of ML-ConvNet utilises a masked loss function that overcomes the effect of missing labels in predicting AMR. The proposed ML-ConvNet is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods in the literature by 10.5%, according to the F1 score. The proposed model's performance is evaluated using different degrees of the missing label and is found to outperform the conventional approach by 76% in the F1 score when 86.68% of labels are missing. Furthermore, the proposed ML-ConvNet is established with an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) pipeline, thereby making it ideally suited for hospitals and healthcare settings where model interpretability is an essential requirement.","AI","University of Surrey"

Findings on infectious doses of contemporary highly-pathogenic strains isolated from outbreaks in Eastern Europe were included. Published data on disinfectant susceptibility of ASF virus were then compared with similar findings for selected other infectious agents, principally those used in the UK disinfectant approvals tests relating to relevant Disease Orders for the control of notifiable and zoonotic diseases of livestock. These are: swine vesicular disease virus, foot and mouth disease virus, Newcastle disease virus and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The comparative data thus obtained, presented in a series of charts, facilitated estimates of efficacy against ASF virus for some UK approved disinfectants when applied at their respective General Orders concentrations. Substantial data gaps were encountered for several disinfectant agents or classes, including peracetic acid, quaternary ammonium compounds and products based on phenols and cresols.","AI","University of Surrey"
"Factors Influencing Users’ Willingness to Adopt and Use Artificially Intelligent Assistants for Travel","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Factors-Influencing-Users-Willingness-to-Adopt/99594823802346?institution=44SUR_INST","CHAO  LING","31/08/2021","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed various industries, including the tourism and hospitality industry. AI Assistants are one example of AI adoption in the tourism and hospitality industry. AI assistants can aid travellers in searching for information and simplify their travel planning process. They can also help travel companies to deliver personalised, efficient, and effective customer service. Though research has hinted about how AI systems are transforming travel experiences, little research to-date has focused on how travellers evaluate the use of AI Assistants. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the determinants of user satisfaction of and behavioural intentions towards AI Assistants in the context of travel. Specifically, this thesis explored which factors determine user satisfaction of Human-AI Assistant interaction process and outcomes, and the willingness to adopt and use AI Assistants in the future for travel purposes.     Following a mixed-methods explanatory sequential design, this thesis consists of four distinct studies, including: Study 1: systematic literature review (n = 18), Study 2: a qualitative study using content analysis (interviews, n = 42), Study 3: laboratory experiments (n = 70), and Study 4: online surveys utilising Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) (n = 1066). The four studies are interrelated. Considering the context of the study is relatively new, this thesis applies abductive approach to provide better insights into the use of AI Assistants. The conceptual model was developed based on the findings from qualitative phases, the updated IS Success Model, and the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2). The findings indicated that perceived, perceived safety, and expectancy are core determinants of user satisfaction with information, while perceived safety and expectancy have significant influence on user satisfaction with interaction process. The results confirmed the important positive role of user satisfaction in user behavioural intentions.","AI","University of Surrey"
"On-Orbit Robotic Grasping of a Spent Rocket Stage: Grasp Stability Analysis and Experimental Results","https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/On-Orbit-Robotic-Grasping-of-a-Spent/99822309802346?institution=44SUR_INST","Nikos Mavrakis; Zhou Hao; Yang Gao","17/06/2021","The increased complexity of the tasks that on-orbit robots have to undertake has led to an increased need for manipulation dexterity. Space robots can become more dexterous by adopting grasping and manipulation methodologies and algorithms from terrestrial robots. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for evaluating the stability of a robotic grasp that captures a piece of space debris, a spent rocket stage. We calculate the Intrinsic Stiffness Matrix of a 2-fingered grasp on the surface of an Apogee Kick Motor nozzle and create a stability metric that is a function of the local contact curvature, material properties, applied force, and target mass. We evaluate the efficacy of the stability metric in a simulation and two real robot experiments. The subject of all experiments is a chasing robot that needs to capture a target AKM and pull it back towards the chaser body. In the V-REP simulator, we evaluate four grasping points on three AKM models, over three pulling profiles, using three physics engines. We also use a real robotic testbed with the capability of emulating an approaching robot and a weightless AKM target to evaluate our method over 11 grasps and three pulling profiles. Finally, we perform a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate how a variation on the grasping parameters affects grasp stability. The results of all experiments suggest that the grasp can be stable under slow pulling profiles, with successful pulling for all targets. The presented work offers an alternative way of capturing orbital targets and a novel example of how terrestrial robotic grasping methodologies could be extended to orbital activities.","AI","University of Surrey"

B. Ashith Shyam; Arunkumar Rathinam; Yang Gao","01/06/2021","Conventional spacecraft Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) architectures have been designed to receive and execute commands from ground control with minimal automation and autonomy onboard spacecraft. In contrast, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems can allow real-time decision-making by considering system information that is difficult to model and incorporate in the conventional decision-making process involving ground control or human operators. With growing interests in on-orbit services with manipulation, the conventional GNC faces numerous challenges in adapting to a wide range of possible scenarios, such as removing unknown debris, potentially addressed using emerging AI-enabled robotic technologies. However, a complete paradigm shift may need years' efforts. As an intermediate solution, we introduce a novel visual GNC system with two state-of-the-art AI modules to replace the corresponding functions in the conventional GNC system for on-orbit manipulation. The AI components are as follows: (i) A Deep Learning (DL)-based pose estimation algorithm that can estimate a target's pose from two-dimensional images using a pre-trained neural network without requiring any prior information on the dynamics or state of the target. (ii) A technique for modeling and controlling space robot manipulator trajectories using probabilistic modeling and reproduction to previously unseen situations to avoid complex trajectory optimizations on board. This also minimizes the attitude disturbances of spacecraft induced on it due to the motion of the robot arm. This architecture uses a centralized camera network as the main sensor, and the trajectory learning module of the 7 degrees of freedom robotic arm is integrated into the GNC system. The intelligent visual GNC system is demonstrated by simulation of a conceptual mission—AISAT. The mission is a micro-satellite to carry out on-orbit manipulation around a non-cooperative CubeSat. The simulation shows how the GNC system works in discrete-time simulation with the control and trajectory planning are generated in Matlab/Simulink. The physics rendering engine, Eevee, renders the whole simulation to provide a graphic realism for the DL pose estimation. In the end, the testbeds developed to evaluate and demonstrate the GNC system are also introduced. The novel intelligent GNC system can be a stepping stone toward future fully autonomous orbital robot systems.","AI","University of Surrey"

B. Ashith Shyam; Zhou Hao; Umberto Montanaro; Shilp Dixit; Arunkumar Rathinam; Yang Gao; Gerhard Neumann; Saber Fallah","04/05/2021","This paper adds on to the on-going efforts to provide more autonomy to space robots and introduces the concept of programming by demonstration or imitation learning for trajectory planning of manipulators on free-floating spacecraft. A redundant 7-DoF robotic arm is mounted on small spacecraft dedicated for debris removal, on-orbit servicing and assembly, autonomous and rendezvous docking. The motion of robot (or manipulator) arm induces reaction forces on the spacecraft and hence its attitude changes prompting the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) to take large corrective action. The method introduced here is capable of finding the trajectory that minimizes the attitudinal changes thereby reducing the load on ADCS. One of the critical elements in spacecraft trajectory planning and control is the power consumption. The approach introduced in this work carry out trajectory learning offline by collecting data from demonstrations and encoding it as a probabilistic distribution of trajectories. The learned trajectory distribution can be used for planning in previously unseen situations by conditioning the probabilistic distribution. Hence almost no power is required for computations after deployment. Sampling from a conditioned distribution provides several possible trajectories from the same start to goal state. To determine the trajectory that minimizes attitudinal changes, a cost term is defined and the trajectory which minimizes this cost is considered the optimal one.","AI","University of Surrey"

The characterising feature of pattern search methods is the use of multiple directions spanning the problem domain to sample new candidate solutions. These directions compose a matrix of potential search moves, that is the pattern. Although some fundamental studies theoretically indicate that various directions can be used, the selection of the search directions remains an unaddressed problem. The present article proposes a procedure for selecting the directions that guarantee high convergence/high performance of pattern search. The proposed procedure consists of a fitness landscape analysis to characterise the geometry of the problem by sampling points and selecting those whose objective function values are below a threshold. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of this distribution are then used as search directions for the pattern search. Numerical results show that the proposed method systematically outperforms its standard counterpart and is competitive with modern complex direct search and metaheuristic methods.","AI","University of Surrey"

We propose to use both single-input single-output (SISO), as well as multiple-input single-output (MISO) test cases. To demonstrate the method, we operated the Chalmers mm-wave MIMO testbed, MATE, at 29.4 GHz in a line of sight test configuration. For the MISO case, a beamforming algorithm is used to steer the beams at one RX. The algorithm exhibits measurement results that agree well with theoretical analysis and are sufficiently stable over time. By sweeping the transmit power, in the SISO and MISO cases, the sources of distortion can be clearly differentiated.","AI","University of Surrey"
