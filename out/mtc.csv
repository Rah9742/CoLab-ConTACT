"Eviosys - Tool Change Audit","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/eviosys-tool-change-audit/","The eviosys sites at mansfield and carlisle produce tins of various design for the food industry with relatively short production runs.  Separate lines produce the tin body and lids, current time taken to change, set and verify the lines take around 5 days on average (with 24hr working).  Capacity impact in august 2022; 11 changes across 24 lines resulting in 55 days lost working time due to changeover. Impact – customer delivery frequently compromised, along with overtime costs and pressure on production personnel. ","The project trained eight eviosys personnel to capture and analyse current set up procedures across multiple lines at mansfield and carlisle through use of video capture (gopro).  Training included covering the lean principles of smed (single minute exchange of die), 8 wastes, the use of video to capture and analyse current changeover procedures and the use of swct (standardised work combination tables) to graphically illustrate the time taken for each changeover element.  The activity relied on a team-based approach, with eviosys personnel ‘learning by doing’ through application of lean principles and following a pdca (plan do check act cycle) discipline. ","In total, 8 separate changeover processes across tin lid and tin body lines were observed, recorded, and analysed.  A total of 60 separate waste items were identified by the eviosys teams, and countermeasures were brainstormed.  From these, 51 countermeasures were identified as priority through an ease/impact assessment.  In addition, 23 opportunities for technology adoption to improve the changeover process were identified. ","Application of smed and 8 wastes lean training resulted in the eviosys teams identifying improvements that have the potential to reduce current set up times by up to 44%.  Reviewing opportunities to apply technology identified potential time savings of a further 39%.  Reviewing the impact on the full value stream (warehousing, inventory, use of temporary workers etc. ) the potential for applying the identified improvements is an estimated annual cost saving of £270,000.

"Lifecycle Assessment to Validate Sustainability of Laser Surface Texturing","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/lifecycle-assessment-to-validate-sustainability-of-laser-surface-texturing/","The laser processing team at the mtc have successfully develop a superhydrophobic (water repellent) surface for the dryer’s evaporator unit fins.  It was calculated that this change to the product could reduce the drying cycle time, and therefore reduce the energy consumption by 5%. Whilst on the face of it, this manufacturing process change appears to be more sustainable, assessing the environmental impact over the full life of the product is essential to ensure the new process is truly more sustainable. To provide this assessment, an lca, which covers the products lifecycle cradle to grave, was used.  This means the full breadth of environmental impacts are considered across all phases of the products life. ","Using lca methodology, the mtc validated the proposed solution.  This considered the trade-off between the additional energy needed for the laser process compared to the energy savings over the tumble dryer’s life cycle. It was found that, despite the reduction in energy consumption, the laser process would have a negative environmental impact on the tumble dryer, due to the additional manufacturing step. Whilst the application of lst to each fin was found to be less sustainable, an alternative approach of texturing a forming tool, which could then transpose the texture onto each fin, would achieve a net reduction in environmental impact. ","The mtc successfully generated a water repellent surface on the evaporator unit fins using lst, with water contact angle measurement data to validate and quantify this perceived benefit. The functionality’s durability of the surface (hydrophobicity) was evaluated and passed an industry standard steam test. Using lca, the mtc identified a manufacturing route for a tumble dryer evaporator, that will both improve surface functionality whilst providing a net-reduction in the product’s environmental impact. ","Impartial environmental assessment of the impact of mtc manufacturing capability using lca. A more sustainable manufacturing route, using lst, was modelled in the lca, and showed an improvement across all lca impact categories, using several different life cycle impact assessment (lcia) methods. When comparing the textured die tool to the benchmark scenario, a 36% environmental impact reduction could be achieved, based on the recipe endpoint lcia method, a standardised approach to converting impacts into a single score for comparison purposes.

"Accelerating Concrete Bridge Deck Examinations","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/accelerating-concrete-bridge-deck-examinations/","Bridges represent a critical part of the highways infrastructure and deterioration of these assets is a concern in terms of both public safety and economic burden. Bridge decks are currently examined by closing the section of highway, stripping the asphalt surface layer and conducting manual testing on the exposed underlying concrete, before re-surfacing and re-opening the highway.  This process is slow, manual, costly and can cause significant disruption to road users. There is a strong desire to identify an alternative approach that is fast, quantitative and does not require extensive closures as a result of stripping road surfaces. ","The mtc has demonstrated how ground penetrating radar (gpr) technology can be used to transform the current approach to bridge deck maintenance. A vehicle-mounted gpr array system was used to rapidly scan a bridge asset that was planned to undergo a full conventional intrusive bridge deck examination that would enable validation of the results. By using both commercial software and bespoke analysis, a large variety of insights and visualisations were generated that provided a comprehensive understanding into the bridge structure and indications of potential defects.

The system was also able to identify regions of rebar degradation that correlated well with regions of spalling and delamination subsequently identified by a full, intrusive principle examination of the bridge deck.

","The inspection approach demonstrated was completely non-destructive and a short cycle time (<45 minutes for an 80 m bridge) and it was clear that inspection through the asphalt road surfacing had minimal impact on the capabilities of gpr. This means that road surfacing stripping is not required for this technology which removes significant costs and disruption to road users. Importantly, the results obtained will allow for better cost certainty for bridge maintenance activities, allow for targeting of intrusive examinations and obtain a digital mapping of assets for improve data traceability.

"Advancing Electric Motors Through Additive Manufacturing","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/advancing-electric-motors-through-additive-manufacturing/","The drive to net zero has created a necessity for electric motors to target a wider range of applications.  Wherehigher performance is required efficiency is key, and therefore the design and manufacture need to enable a high degree of optimisation. Conventional manufacturing routes limit design freedom, falling short of a highly efficient motor design, therefore the exploration of disruptive manufacturing technologies such as additivemanufacturing (am) is required. The limitations in design for conventional manufacturing processes also limit the ease of assembly, requiring multiple components and numerous fixings.  Assembly of a high performance motor could be improved though am. ","Using a combination of siemens nx and ntopology enabled an end to end workflow to support manufacturing whilst enabling high design complexity with reduced computing effort. Ntopology offered a solution for topology optimisation, implicit modelling and automated workflows which streamlined the approach to producing components that met the functional requirements of the application, whilst also utilising the full benefits of the am process. The am process team developed optimised process parameters for a high strength am aluminium alloy (a20x). ","The mtc team redesigned the subtractive manufactured casing and combined 3 machined components, 8 fasteners, and 3 o-rings into a single part.  Developing optimised processing parameters for a high strength al alloy (a20x) ensured the casing was strong enough to meet the structural requirements, was light weight and minimised material usage.  The result led to a reducedmass of over 65% compared to the original cnc casing, and benefits including reduction of assembly steps, elimination of multiple seals, and reduced lifetime environmental impact. The motor is designed for 74kw (peak)/27kw (cont. ) with a total mass of 10. 4kg providing an output of 7. 1 kw/kg. The motor design won its category at the 3d pioneers challenge, an international am design competition, receiving praise for its leveraging the advantages of am to improve performance and sustainability. ","Am has been demonstrated as a viable manufacturing route for high performance electric motors where the increased manufacturing cost is offset by the improved performance and potential cost savings throughout its service life. Advanced design tools offered through ntopology enabled greater design freedom to fully exploit am.  Demonstration of reusable workflows enables an iterative approach to design as well as being able to use across component families. A more efficient assembly process can be achieved through the consolidation of components and removal of fasteners and seals.  The use of one way and zero turnover assembly provides a more efficient, reduced step workflow assembly process. ","MTC"

Together, the teams worked to re-design the product to make it more cost effective and therefore more competitive in the market.  . ","Fresh check approached the mtc with the brief to explore how the swab could be re-designed and then manufactured at a more competitive price point to take the product to market. At the start of the project, the pmi team conducted a series of ideation workshops which included an in-depth analysis of the other products on the market, as well as understanding fresh check’s target audience and the manufacturing costs of the current prototype design. The prototype was manufactured in four components, like similar products on the market; this was an expensive way to manufacture the product, and the team explored options to decrease the number of parts and therefore reduce costs. By following this route, mtc believed it could help fresh check to achieve a key point of difference in its product design, whilst also meeting the initial requirements of the project to make the product more cost effective. New to the plastics manufacturing industry, fresh check was sourcing its plastic from china but was coming up against supply chain issues, as well as challenges with the quality of the product.  The mtc was able to utilise its network and vendor agnostic approach to start the procurement process of reshoring its sourcing and manufacturing to the uk. ","The initial phase of the project of re-designing the product was completed, with two finalised designs focusing on a two-part design that makes fresh check stand out from its competitors.  The proposed designs are also more cost effective to manufacture, in turn helping to increase the product’s profitability. The mtc has also started to work with fresh check on how, through future projects, the product could be further refined.  This includes identifying a preferred manufacturer and plastics source in the uk to ensure a higher quality of product, as well as improving the designs further for more efficient manufacturing, and supporting fresh check with the capability to assemble the product itself. A key aspect of the ongoing work will also be to look at the sustainability of the product including the packaging and materials used, as this is a key cornerstone of the company’s vision. This was a great project to work on; we were able to explore more about the hygiene market, in particular hygiene within the food industry and the level of testing required.  Through collaboration and the passion and engagement from the fresh check team, we have a product with a real point of difference, that makes the brand stand out from the crowd.  Through future projects we hope to develop it even further from an ease-of-manufacture perspective, as well as from a sustainability point of view too. Dale armson, research engineering, mtc  .  .

"RecHycle: Re-imagining Electrolyser Construction for HYdrogen within a CircuLar Economy","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/rechycle-re-imagining-electrolyser-construction-for-hydrogen-within-a-circular-economy/","In 2021, the uk government published its hydrogen strategy with the target of developing 5gw of low carbon hydrogen production capacity in the uk by 2030.  This ambition has since been revised to 10gw.  So called “green” hydrogen is produced from water electrolysis powered by renewable energy.  This will provide an important energy vector that can directly replace fossil fuels and enable net-zero decarbonisation across challenging sectors of the economy such as heavy road transport, shipping, industrial and domestic heating, and industrial production such as chemicals, cement and steel. In recent years the mtc, in partnership with the other high value manufacturing catapult centres, has built a detailed understanding of the technological advancements required to support the future global hydrogen value chain.  A huge amount of research effort is focused on reducing the levelised cost of hydrogen (lcoh) by increasing electrolyser efficiency and ramping up production rates in the coming years, but just as important is embedding a sustainable circular economy within the manufacturing supply chain to ensure the equipment itself has the lowest possible embodied carbon emissions. In the rechycle project, the mtc created a new net shape manufacturing method that has the potential to enable relatively low cost, and more sustainable scale-up in manufacture of polymer electrolyte membrane (pem) electrolysers, which are some of the most promising systems for the production of green hydrogen at present. Consolidated titanium plate with integrated porous structure and dissolvable salt insert","The mtc, as a centre of excellence for net shape manufacturing and powder metallurgy, is very well placed to develop innovative processing methods that can dramatically reduce material waste and the embodied carbon emissions associated with traditional supply chains.  Net shape powder metallurgy processes are capable of forming components close to their final geometry by applying moderate pressures and heat, densifying powders into a solid part by bonding the particles together without melting them.  Minimal material is wasted and very few finishing activities are needed to meet the final dimensional specification.  In addition, components have excellent mechanical properties suitable for industries requiring high integrity products that operate in demanding operating environments. Historically however, low-volume production and relatively high-cost tooling have limited the wider usage of powder metallurgy within high throughput and cost sensitive supply chains.  In an attempt to address this the mtc has created an innovative solution that uses low-cost inserts made from dissolvable salt.  These facilitate geometric complexity similar to investment castings, but enable the use of low cost tooling and the simple removal of finished components using regular water after the densification process is complete. The mtc’s first application of this invention has been the production of multiple intricate titanium electrolyser plates with integrated porous surfaces through one, single, low energy processing step.  This is not only a far more streamlined process compared to the cast and wrought titanium supply chains currently utilised, but also combines three conventionally separate components into one. The huge opportunity presented by this increased design freedom at relatively low cost became very clear after discussion with experts in the field, who typically just look to purchase off-the-shelf sheet metal as their material starting stock.  The mtc’s unique approach may, for example, have the potential to increase the operational efficiency of electrolysers and fuel cells, as reducing the number of components/ layers/ interfaces within the cell stack reduces overall electrical resistance.  Additionally, tailored porous structures can easily be created that optimise fluid flow and proton exchange membrane performance. ","The mtc initially identified hot isostatic pressing (hip) as a potential method to consolidate recycled or minimally processed titanium powders into electrolyser plates.  After initial trials an alternative net shape process with fewer production steps called spark plasma sintering (sps), or alternatively field assisted sintering technology (fast) was assessed.  Like hip, this is a solid state powder consolidation process achieving very high quality fine grain microstructures with uniform properties and extremely few defects. After some feasibility trials, sps was found to be just as capable as hip for producing plate-like components with porous surface structures using the mtc’s dissolvable inserts technique.  Sps has the added advantage of using reusable dies and having short consolidation cycles.  When combined with automated die filling, the proposed solution may be capable of achieving relatively high throughput production at low-cost and with minimal material wastage or energy consumption. The mtc worked in partnership with a team from the university of sheffield to create a series of demonstrator parts.  The birmingham energy institute at the university of birmingham supported the prototyping of bipolar plates intended to operate under the harsh acidic and high voltage environments found within an industrial pem electrolyser. To verify the proposed solution’s sustainability benefits, the mtc utilised its expertise in life cycle assessment (lca) to analyse the embodied carbon emissions of various supply chains and production processes.  An approximation of the current commercial pem electrolyser manufacturing route was used as a baseline, including conventional titanium sheet manufacturing and traditional electrolyser stack assembly routes.  The findings confirmed that there is a great deal of environmental benefit to be gained from the unconventional powder production routes the mtc have developed through the rechycle project.

"Enhancing the Performance of LI-ION Batteries in Harsh Environments","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/enhancing-the-performance-of-li-ion-batteries-in-harsh-environments/","In recent years, there has been a growing demand for lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries that have a longer lifetime and provide more consistent performance in harsh environment applications such as those found in the automotive, defence and oil exploration systems sectors. Currently, in extreme atmospheric conditions, the expansion and contraction that the cell experiences cause a binder depletion between its current collector and its coated layer which results in delamination between the copper foil and its coated graphite, therefore causing significant reliability issues. The challenge for the mtc was to exploit recent advancements in the laser processing of battery materials including the use of short, pulsed lasers to optimise li-ion battery performance.  The aim was to introduce different properties and restructure the surfaces inside li-ion batteries to improve surface adhesion between the coated layer and the anode to ultimately reduce the possibility of failure. ","To address the challenge set out, engineers at the mtc utilised laser surface micro-texturing, a new, innovative process using ultra short, fast lasers that could achieve the desired performance benefits in the proof-of-concept demonstrator. Firstly, the team completed a period of analysis on an off-the-shelf li-ion battery to understand where the loss of performance was occurring and how this could be addressed. Using laser surface micro-texturing, the team were able to create well defined and controlled structures on the surface of the anode to increase adhesion and improve bond strength which in doing so would better the quality of manufacturing in this high-energy anode material. Through a series of further in-house tests to prove the validity of the solution, additional optimisations on the restructured surfaces were completed to enhance and prove the performance of the demonstrator battery in testing environments. ","The mtc used laser surface micro-texturing and an optimised laser setting to produce a new, micro-textured demonstrator battery that performs better under extreme conditions.  The optimised battery showed a 32% improvement in the surface adhesion leading to a more robust and safer cell compared to the off-theshelf li-ion battery. As a result of this project, the mtc has identified a high value manufacturing process that is a viable and scalable, alternative method to the current ‘roll-to-roll’ manufacturing process of the cells. ","Through utilising an advanced laser-based surface engineering process, alongside the expertise of experienced researchers and engineers, the mtc has successfully demonstrated the positive impact that lasers can have on the performance of battery cells in extreme environments. The integration of laser surface micro-texturing on the production line could also save time and make a vital performance change leading to the removal of calendaring from the current process and the use of more powerful lasers as surface texturing technology matures, improving the overall quality of li-ion battery manufacturing. Further to this, the mtc identified that this innovative process could be used to lengthen the life span of the battery and enhance how the cell manages heat by focusing on the texturing of the battery housing to allow the cell to charge under higher currents. The project has also shown that laser surface microtexturing could provide wider benefits to other high value manufacturing industries.  This process to improve the bond strength of adhesives could boost heat conduction in sectors where high-performance, thermal management units are used such as the aerospace, automotive and defence arenas.  It could also support anti-fouling systems on propellors in the marine sector by creating surfaces with well-defined structures that are better for the environment and reduce pollution. Overall, the creation of this new li-ion battery demonstrator has shown that laser-based engineering processes could be vital to the development of li-ion battery cells, and it has provided the mtc with an opportunity to work with its membership to explore how lasers could further influence uk manufacturing.

Based in norfolk, warren services offers its clients full turnkey solutions to engineering and design, and a pioneering approach to sustainable manufacturing and the training of the workforce of tomorrow.  With location being a limiting factor to the amount of readily available human resource, the mtc was tasked with disseminating a strategy that retains the commitment of the current workforce and makes warren services and manufacturing an employer of choice to attract local talent from local schools, colleges and universities. As well as addressing the strategic requirements of the business, the new plan for warren services would need to futureproof its operations and provide scope for future growth including the exploitation of new sectors, new technologies and being able to obtain certain accreditations that would allow them to enter markets successfully including ‘fit for offshore renewables’. ","The project was split into two phases of work.  Firstly, the business transformation team utilising their strategy, culture and coaching service offering created a process model to understand the manufacturer’s existing operations and to help identify its current strengths and weaknesses.

"Precision Acoustics: Applying additive manufacturing capabilities to overcome production challenges to enable SME to bring new solution to market","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/precision-acoustics-applying-additive-manufacturing-capabilities-to-overcome-production-challenges-to-enable-sme-to-bring-new-solution-to-market/","Precision acoustics is a global manufacturer of acoustic measurement products to medical, ndt (non-destructive testing) and academic establishments. Originally, the precision acoustics team planned to produce the lining through a moulding process.  However, earlier attempts to manufacture the mould, alongside further discussions with manufacturers, highlighted challenges associated with the geometry and size of the lining.  The only viable solution was to 3d print the lining in sections, but this caused issues with precision and ease of assembly, as well as achieving the required finish to the product. In speaking with the high value manufacturing catapult (hvmc), precision acoustics were introduced to the mtc to explore alternative solutions. ","In order to meet the customer’s requirements for this project, the mtc team first outlined a strategy for manufacture.  Central to this was technology and material selection, which was determined by a detailed assessment process, working in collaboration with precision acoustics. The mtc’s additive manufacturing team then looked at the possibility of using their large build envelope 3d printer, a stratasys objet 1000, to produce a full-size lining template out of a simulated polypropylene material called rigur rgd450.  Chosen for its mechanical properties and surface finish, the template would enable precision acoustics to produce a soft mould from silicone. This did present some uncertainties, for example, the geometrical intricacies in the design could lead to some features of the lining template being at risk of breaking in the silicone mould.  Furthermore, because the material was the most significant contributor to the overall cost of producing the template, the mtc team built smaller test parts first, before committing to a full-size build. The iterations also tested against warpage; a concern due to the size of the product when it would be manufactured at full-size.  Design adjustments were made during the three trial phases, after which point, the proposed final specification of the full-size template was agreed. ","The mtc’s additive manufacturing team not only identified a suitable material and technology combination in order to meet product specifications, but it was also able to achieve this in a cost-effective manner. The original design of the lining was adapted during the trial phases in collaboration with precision acoustics, with the mtc team drawing upon their expertise and experience of past projects to develop a viable solution.  The project was also completed in a short timeframe, to enable the customer to proceed with the launch of new products.

Given the global transition from combustion engines to electric motor propulsion, industries such as automotive, aerospace and the rail sector are continually trying to find ways of improving the power density for their existing systems. The challenge for the mtc was to use high-value design tools such as topology optimisation to optimise an off-the-shelf heat sink, such as those found in a variable speed drive.  The aim was to improve the heat transfer away from the electronic components, therefore allowing for enhanced thermal performance and a reduction in the overall weight. ","To address the challenge, engineers at the mtc utilised high-value design tools that could achieve the desired performance benefits for the proof-of-concept demonstrator. First, the team reverse engineered the initial design using traditional cad software.  Comsol multiphysics® topology optimisation was then used to remove the fins on the cross-sectional shape of the heat sink and optimised with a dendritic design to allow for a greater flow of air.  Additional design work was conducted, applying a fractal approach to mimic the behaviour seen in nature and extend upon the output of the optimisation. Further design changes were made to fully utilise the additive manufacturing design freedom.  This included the addition of dimples to improve the surface texturing of the heat sink which further improved the heat transfer with a reduction in the pressure drop. ","The mtc has used thermal-fluid optimisation and additive manufacturing to produce a high-performance heat sink.  These high-value design and manufacturing techniques have allowed for the proposed design to benefit from a 20% improvement in thermal performance with a 6% reduction in overall mass compared to the original design.

"Antimicrobial - Contact Safe Surfaces","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/antimicrobial-contact-safe-surfaces/","The covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of contact safe surfaces to minimise the transmission of bacteria and viruses from unclean surfaces.  The challenge of keeping surfaces clean is faced every day in environments such as food factories, hospitals and public transport. There are numerous articles and research papers highlighting the antimicrobial benefits of materials such as copper.  However, high concentrations of copper are expensive, prone to tarnishing, and have reduced mechanical properties and corrosion resistance when compared to commonly used stainless steel. The challenge was to develop and validate materials with antimicrobial properties, that are cost effective and have appropriate structural integrity and corrosion resistance for demanding applications. ","None","The mtc was able to create a route for designing, fabricating and evaluating contact safe surfaces. A range of demonstrator components were successfully manufactured from a copper-containing stainless steel material, including door furniture and medical instruments. The presence of functional copper particles were observed in images taken of the surfaces. The level of s.  Aureus and e.  Coli bacteria was found to reduce by 99. 8% and 98. 9% respectively after 24 hours when compared to a standard solid stainless steel surface. ","Contact safe surfaces offer antimicrobial benefits to industry, especially in applications which have hard-to-clean surfaces or have high microbial transmission risks. The use of commercially available copper-containing stainless steel provides antimicrobial benefits, while maintaining the structural integrity and cost benefits of stainless steel. By leveraging the mtc’s materials processing experts and ncam capabilities, mtc can help industry develop and prove out the application of materials with antimicrobial properties, to provide safer work environments.

"Robocrop: Spot the Robotic Dog","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/robocrop-spot-the-robotic-dog/","Studies have found that over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields.  In march 2021 the robocrop project, based at mtc liverpool, won innovate uk funding to utilise boston dynamics’ spot® robots to investigate and prove the benefits of using advanced robotics to reduce the use of chemicals in the agricultural sector. The project, run in conjunction with partners at bardsley england, one of the uk’s leading fruit farm specialists that operates across 26 sites over 850 hectares, would also seek to highlight the wider commercial, environmental and health benefits that are realised when using robots in these practices.  As part of its work with boston dynamics to develop spot’s capabilities and prove its worth to uk manufacturing, the mtc was tasked with designing, building, and testing a new payload for spot®. The new payload would be used for agricultural inspection activities and to demonstrate how reducing pesticide usage can increase crop yield and improve produce quality whilst also reducing labour costs and subsequently freeing up resource for value added tasks.  In the case of bardsley england, spot® would be required to inspect apples in the orchard to determine the ripeness and quality, but most importantly detect any diseases and pests that might be prevalent. ","Automation and robotics experts at the mtc utilised their extensive knowledge and cross-industry experience to create a payload that attaches to the back of spot®.  Alongside an on-board computer and a robotic, 4k camera system that is capable of autonomously controlling and managing the robot’s everyday activities, the mtc designed payload included a crop inspecting image processing system that would scan crops and detect any diseases or pests in the process. This would mean that chemicals would only be applied where and when required.  To accompany this, engineers also developed a unique user interface that would allow bardsley england to view the data collected from the orchard in real time.  The interface would also make the management and handling of the robot fleet simpler and more effective. ","Following completion of testing on the payload and on-site with bardsley england, the mtc has been able to successfully demonstrate the positive impact that complex autonomous mobile robots, ai and vision systems can have on operations in the uk agricultural sector.  For bardsley england, the future of its operations is to grow carbon negative food and the use of robotics will help them to achieve their aim of totally automating their orchards by 2030. The robocrop system has shown that using robots that are able to work autonomously to achieve the round the clock crop management required can be extremely valuable, improving efficiency and allowing highly skilled farmers and engineers to complete value-added tasks that will in turn create a higher quality crop.  This more proactive, dataled approach to farming will allow operations like bardsley england to save costs, increase annual profits and grow healthier products in a more sustainable, environmentally minded manner which will reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides. ","Introducing robotics into agriculture has previously been a huge challenge due to factors such as terrain, the environment, plot sizes and the large potential cost to the business if poorly implemented. Working with bardsley england and its tech partner, bx, and leveraging the capabilities of advanced robotics, mtc has been able to demonstrate a number of benefits that will transform the uk agricultural sector including:. The ability to be better planned and quantify a yield at an earlier stage to give a competitive advantage in the market. Early disease detection means better targeted application of pesticides and herbicides which decreases the amount of pollutants being emitted into the environment, therefore improving soil quality and encouraging more sustainable practices. Reduction of costs through the use of less chemicals and manual labour.

Based in leicestershire, leisurebench prides itself on the quality of its products and drive for sustainability, and as part of this ethos, the mtc was tasked with providing solutions that would allow for leisurebench to manufacture furniture from recycled plastic, as well as its current and popular line of wooden outdoor products. As well as addressing the current requirements of the business, the proposed solutions would need to futureproof leisurebench’s operations and provide scope for future organic growth. ","The project was split into four phases of work, all of which were completed in under four weeks.  Firstly, the manufacturing support services (mss) and business transformation teams completed a process analysis to understand the manufacturer’s existing operations and to help identify limitations and areas for improvement.  The results of this analysis led to the formation of a roadmap transformation journey focused on a future state, within which five key pieces of equipment were identified that would best meet leisurebench’s manufacturing objectives. To support the investment bid, three comparative quotes were required for each of the five pieces of machinery; this was completed in less than one week to meet the tight timescales of the application. The next phase of the project saw a further 30 quotes for new equipment sourced against an extended brief from the client.  Proposed solutions were aligned to this and the roadmap previously identified, with key factors including a drive towards more automated processes, effective cost management, maximising factory floor space and operational sustainability, whilst critically delivering against the manufacturing requirements of the existing and new product ranges. All quotes were compiled and presented to the client to permit ease of comparison of product specifications and costs.  This information was also supplied to the leisurebench team in a format that supported their funding requirements. In-line with leisurebench’s drive to improve sustainability, the equipment proposed would not only meet the manufacturing requirements of the new recycled plastic product line, but the mtc also focused on suppliers within the midlands and therefore near to leisurebench’s proposed new factory location.  The project team consulted with others across the mtc to obtain recommendations as part of the organisation’s ongoing work to support the local supply chain. The mtc also provided consultancy to support leisurebench’s adoption of digital management processes.  This also included how the business stores and uses data to inform key performance indicators (kpis). ","15 different assets or machines were identified and down selected from the process analysis. 45 quotations from more than 20 midlands-based suppliers were researched and supplied to the client in under four weeks. Almost £250,000 worth of equipment was scoped out and key information supplied to the client. Information and analysis was directly supplied in formats suitable to submit with the funding application. ","The client was provided with solutions that would not only serve its existing operational requirements, but would futureproof the business and provide opportunities for organic growth. Implementation of digital kpis would support the business in making de-risked decisions moving forwards. Speed of turnaround and presentation of key information was vital in the support of the investment decision. ","MTC"
"Chillblast: People Development and Workplace Organisation to Increase Productivity and Maximise Workshop Space","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/chillblast-people-development-and-workplace-organisation-to-increase-productivity-and-maximise-workshop-space/","Chillblast, based in the south of england, has built a reputation as a leading manufacturing of gaming desktops.  In 2019, a new operations manager role was created and chillblast saw this as an opportunity to overhaul its internal processes to better manage the workforce and reorganise the workshop to create a more efficient production process flow to cope with surges in demand at certain points of the year. Through its connections with the bcp council and the dorset engineering and manufacturing cluster (demc), chillblastbecame aware of how the mtc’s manufacturing support services (mss) help manufacturing smes to raise productivity levels and de-risk technology investments. Chillblast approached the mtc to advise on supporting the development of existing operations to maximise output in a sustainable manner as well as managing the review of production kpis and bringing an awareness of 5s, visual management and workplace organisation. ","After initial discussions and workshop tours, the mss team quickly established that it could support chillblast to grow its turnover in a facility that the business thought it had hit its threshold in. Working with the leadership team, mss identified a series of workplace organisation tactics including introducing control boards, production targets, clearly defining roles and responsibilities, standardisation of documentation, and improving overall communication across the business. The mss team also worked directly with the new operations manager to support his own personal development.  Previously a logistic manager for chillblast, individual came into the role with extensive knowledge of the business, but limited experience in managing production. To better maximise the workspace, production line and inventory, the mtc provided a plan to help chillblast understand the current and potential production capability to create a production schedule to be shared with the team. ","In november 2020, chillblast completed its workshop re-organisation by implementing 5s principles to organise materials, tools, consumables and maximise space.  This allowed chillblast to gain a better understanding of its inventory and stock, and subsequently its production capabilities, which was far larger than they initially thought. Mtc also worked closely with chillblast on changing workplace behaviours, both amongst the senior leadership team as well as the wider workforce.  Better business communication processes were initiated, visual management tools were installed, and all documentation was standardised to create efficiencies in the production process to cope with demand. Alongside working with the wider team, mtc also played a significant role in the development and integration of the new operations manager.  With no previous experience in production or operations, mtc was able to support him in setting kpis with the team, creating a series of defined roles and responsibilities, and implementing a number of new process in order to successfully manage an ever-increasing team across a number of departments. The project delivery met all the objectives originally outlined by chillblast including new ways of working, workshop organisation and raising awareness of 5s to support the development of existing operations and realise the true potential of the business. Chillblast has already engaged the mss team in the next project phase.  The mtc will support chillblast to futureproof plans for further capacity increases as well as providing ongoing support to shape team roles and assist with the induction of key production personnel. ","Increased manufacturing productivity and an improved ability to cope with surges in demand including an unprecedented rise throughout the covid-19 pandemic leading to a record year of sales. Better utilisation of space and new internal process led to increased efficiencies enabling the business to grow its turnover within the existing facility. Knowledge sharing and supporting the development of the operations manager has helped the business successfully change behaviours and grow its workforce by over 40%, bringing its new customer services team in-house to meet demand. Improved business communication has created a more motivated workforce and successfully developed internal resource. ","MTC"

Emma wiggs mbe and the british canoeing team identified the single blade paddle used in the vl classification of canoeing as an underperforming piece of equipment. The basic design of the paddle had barely changed in years and wasn’t adapted to the ergonomics of paracanoeists.  It could only be altered by its length with the same basic design of the blade, shaft and handle for all athletes irrespective of their height, weight, hand size, grip preference or stroke style. ","Our project team included lead engineers from the mtc’s high value design, mechatronics, metrology and physics modelling teams, as well as the national centre for additive manufacturing (on-site at the mtc) and composite specialists the national composites centre (ncc) based in bristol. The mtc worked with emma and her coaches at british canoeing to capture the current equipment dimensions and properties, as well as emma’s ergonomics and individual techniques to generate speed and power through the water. A computer simulation model was developed using a digital twin of the old paddle to inform the new design of the carbon fibre paddle developed with the ncc. As part of the testing programme a modular composite tooling was developed by the mtc and ncc to produce various design options, which were then manufactured by the ncc. Various options of the paddle handle were designed, customised to emma’s hands, lightweighted and manufactured via high-performance polymer additive manufacturing, produced at the national centre for additive manufacturing, on-site at the mtc. The various paddle and handle options were then tested by emma to identify the optimum configuration for her hand size and grip preference.

"Factory Optimisation and Visualisation Demonstrator for an Electric Machine Production Line","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/factory-optimisation-and-visualisation-demonstrator-for-an-electric-machine-production-line/","Factory and production optimisation can lead to significant improvements in manufacturing processes.  But for many businesses, the challenge is in accessing key data and analysing it to support the decision making needed to realise these benefits. As part of the organisation’s expanding capabilities in electrification, the mtc identified the manufacture of alightweight electric motor as a case study to apply factory layout optimisation techniques to upgrade manufacturing systems, and in turn, use these findings for broader sector application. Areas that were identified for optimising the manufacture of electric motors included: the required number of workstations with a view to preventing supply bottlenecks, workstation placement to minimise footprint and time spent moving parts between workstations, and the number of operators necessary to run a production system to utilise its full capacity. These factors are interdependent and multifaceted; consequently, a solution was required to address these complex challenges, and support engineers in making well informed decisions to improve manufacturing efficiency. ","The mtc applied simulation technology and advanced data analysis methodologies to generate scenarios at different stages and levels of production of the example electric motor, in order to identify areas for optimisation. Simulation techniques allowed analysis to be performed across multiple production factors (e. G.  Processes, material handling, storage and manual operations) at any one time.  Solutions can then be tested for different scenarios (e. G.  Machinery, systemreconfigurations, shift patterns and maintenance tasks) to help identify likely outcomes. The data extracted from the simulation was analysed and configured into a dashboard to support users with better understanding the information.  These interactive visualisations can display comparative solutions and help individuals from across the business to investigate and understand the data in a more accessible way. ","The factory and production optimisation demonstration ultimately seeks to identify challenges throughout theproduction process, and provide data and analysis to inform decision making based on simulating different scenarios. For example, the demonstration illustrated how a tenfold throughput increase (from 15 to 213 products per day) could be realised, whilst only requiring double the floor space (from 406 m2 to 884 m2). The advanced visualisation solution presented these results, as well as the optimisation decisions, in an interactive and accessible format. ","Well informed decision making for factory and production optimisation to help minimise risk. Intuitive interaction with simulation findings helps non-technical users to understand the analysis and gain insights into the behaviour of the production system. Visualisation of factory layout with accurate animations displays worker movements to support further analysis into machinery and worker positioning. Virtual representation permits users to run different scenarios without impacting manufacturing output or costly prototyping. ","MTC"
"Design for Rapid Subtractive Manufacturing (DfRSM) of Additive Manufactured Components","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/design-for-rapid-subtractive-manufacturing-dfrsm-of-additive-manufactured-components/","With the design freedom that additive manufacturing (am) allows, demand is increasing for more bespoke, compact and lightweight components.  For industry to be able to support this continued evolution and to make am a more viable process, it is vital that the fundamental design rules for each manufacturing process are included as early in the design process as possible. Similar to traditional casting processes, additive manufactured components require subtractive manufacturing to achieve the required tolerances, surface finish, or design features (e. G.  Threaded holes) for a given specification.  These steps introduce cost and time into manufacturing, and despite attempts to achieve higher volume manufacturing of am components, upfront consideration for subtractive manufacturing continues to be overlooked during design. Experts at the mtc, initiated a project to support the development of a toolset to guide designers for rapid and efficient machining of am components.  In this case, a lightweight electric motor casing with integrated cooling channels was used as an example.  The lessons learnt could be applied to similar products as well as other am projects, and when supporting members and customers on their journey from am prototype to full volume manufacturing. ","With support from the national centre for additive manufacturing (ncam), the mtc’s electrification steering committee and leading technology experts, the mtc conducted a comprehensive review of the advanced machining and tooling techniques used by a broad range of industries.  The information collated identified a number of special-purpose tooling and fixturing techniques which were able to combine multiple finishing operations in a single step. Utilising the results alongside knowledge and learnings from previous projects, the mtc was also able to develop a series of design guidelines, and a time savings calculator.  After doing so, the toolset was tested against the existing am electric motor casing prototype for theoretical volume production at 25,000 units per annum. ","Following testing of the new toolset against the prototype, full verification was given to the robust guidelines developed for dfrsm earlier in the design process.  The result led to a potential reduction in subtractive manufacturing from 127 minutes per component, down to 2. 85 minutes – a 98% reduction in time.  Even when accounting for the upfront cost of bespoke tooling, a potential £2. 23million reduction in costs was identified for an assumed production volume of 25,000 parts per annum.

","Laser cleaning was identified as the most suitable cleaning process and in the first phase of the project, the mtc investigated the feasibility of laser cleaning of the battery cell to remove oxidisation and contamination.  A series of experimental trials were conducted and a total of 36 cells were laser programmed, cleaned and characterised, to assess the impact of the cleaning method on bond strength and variability. Phase two of the project focused on further optimising the cleaning process on both old and new cell batches.  The results were compared against electroflight’s existing manual wet chemistry and mechanical cleaning methods, and optimum laser cleaning parameters were established. ","Following completion of the testing, the mtc identified an optimum laser power output to achieve targeted improvements in wire bond strength.  This output resulted in a 130% increase in bond strength of the negative terminals and 40% increase for positive terminals, and a significant reduction in variability.  The optimised cleaned cells also showed significant improvement on repeatability and pull testing performance of the cells during the wire bonding process. Other factors that impacted wire bonding test results were also identified, such as variation in oxide layer thickness due to different batches of battery cells.  Following completion of the project, mss introduced electroflight to laser systems manufacturer ipg photonics to support the adoption of onsite laser technology in-line with the findings from the mtc’s study.

"Social Distancing - The New Normal","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/social-distancing-the-new-normal/","The covid-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the uk economy, with many sectors struggling to re-start operations due to strict social distancing rules being enforced.  The implementation and adherence to these rules is a challenge for the uk construction sector, with a large number of sites struggling to operate normally due to h&s concerns.  This resulted in a 35. 2% decrease in new work, with the largest contributor to that decrease being private housing which fell by 51. 2% in quarter 2 20201. 1as we move on with the ‘new normal’ social distancing is now part of life and is expected to be in place for the foreseeable future, in accordance with government guidelines. The construction innovation hub funded project, investigated social distancing technologies that could be employed in construction, and wider industries, to assist with social distancing and so reduce the impact of the pandemic.  The technology can be utilised to help prevent and, if necessary, track outbreaks of infection, aid workers in adopting safer working practices and ultimately save lives.  By using dedicated tracking systems it is possible to offer an opportunity to the industry to enable intelligent social distancing, tracking interactions and also giving visual and audible warnings of proximity.  Due to the nature of the construction industry most tracking technologies do suffer with interference and mobile based applications are often not accurate, reliable and repeatable enough. The integration of such technologies has the chance to boost the return to work for the construction industry and be industry leading in social distancing safety.  By implementing successful social distancing technologies we can assist in helping prevent the spread of deadly viruses and save lives. ","None","None","None","MTC"
"TZUKA: Redefining Product Design and Assembly Methods to Revolutionise Durable Sports Earbuds","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/tzuka-redefining-product-design-and-assembly-methods-to-revolutionise-durable-sports-earbuds/","Tzuka was founded by tom jelliffe, a keen sportsman and gym goer.  In his final year of university, with nine pairs of broken earphones between him and his gym partner, tom discovered this was a far-reaching problem.  Market research revealed that 10. 4m pairs are broken in the uk during sport every year, with £192m spent on replacement sets. With most sports earphones targeted towards runners and aerobic sports, tom spotted an opportunity to design and manufacture durable sports earbuds that are engineered to withstand use in challenging conditions.  Investigations found that product assembly methods across various brands differed very little, regardless of price, and that these methods were not resistant to impact or exposure to water. Armed with ideas and in the early stages of concept design, tom established tzuka, and sought to procure support for product design and assembly.  A former student of loughborough university, tom was introduced to the mtc’s product manufacturing incubator (pmi) by the university’s graduate enterprise hub, the studio. ","Tom approached the mtc with a brief to design and manufacture durable wireless sports earbuds, capable of taking impact as well as being totally shock, dust and waterproof to enable use during water sports, without compromising high-quality sound output. At the start of the project, the pmi team conducted a series of ideation workshops which included a detailed analysis and review of other products on the market.  This helped formed the basis of the project’s development plan. The mtc’s product design team were tasked with designing the casing and used 3d printing techniques to produce prototypes.  With durability a key usp for the earbuds, the product designs targeted an ik rating (impact protection rating) typically associated with larger products, and therefore had to adapt the design accordingly.  In doing so, the mtc worked in collaboration with newbury electronics who are responsible for the electronic layout. The product was also originally designed with a capacitive button to reduce the requirement for mechanical movement within the casing.  However, feedback from the first round of user testing found that this was difficult to use in conditions where the button’s responsiveness was compromised e. G.  Underwater or in sports where chalk is used for grip e. G.  Weightlifting/climbing.  This resulted in the requirement for a mechanical switch, so the product design was adapted ahead of a second testing phase. From our first meeting, the mtc were very engaged and passionate about the project – when it’s your own ideas being presented, this is really important.  They have been instrumental in the product design and engineering and have helped us improve and refine our product, which has enabled us to incorporate functionality that we didn’t believe would be possible. Tom jelliffe, founder and managing director - tzuka.  . ","The project is now in its final phases and the product, the tz7 armour, is set to launch in autumn 2021.  The collaboration between tzuka, the mtc, and newbury electronics, is set to result in the design and production of the first earbuds ever to have an impact resistance certification.

"Robotic Bin Picking of Unknown Objects","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/robotic-bin-picking-of-unknown-objects/","The mtc demonstrates a state of the art technique for bin picking using a trained model to find the best position to place a vacuum cup.  The mtc has shown that the model can be trained on simulated data reducing the need for labour-intensive manual data collection and labelling. Bin picking is a common handling task seen across industry where single parts must be separated from an unstructured bulk input. Traditional methods use cad data and high cost sensors to accurately identify individual parts and test a range of pre-engineered grasps for feasibility. These approaches are expensive to implement, require substantial engineering time to program, and cannot be applied to objects which are not easily represented by cad models.  Examples include objects that exhibit high variety such as food products and deformable objects. ","Reviewed and down-selected approaches from academic publications showing that neural network-based inference systems can work well for picking items unknown to the system. A neural network-based approach was implemented using pytorch machine learning framework to generalise learned behaviour to new scenes. Algorithms trained with open-source manually labelled dataset and simulated dataset. Performance testing completed using low-cost depth camera and collaborative robot system which would be affordable for many smes. ","Tested on a range of objects including sheet metal components, fruit and cosmetics containers. The models trained with manually labelled data and trained with only simulated data performed well with 92% and 94% of attempted picks being successful, respectively. Performance of the model trained on purely simulated data showed that this approach is a good solution to reduce the burden of data gathering for specific use cases. Excellent performance on items not present in the training data showed that the method generalised well to any items with suitable features for vacuum picking without the need for use case-specific training data. ","Fast deployment of vacuum-based robotic bin picking, mtc is able to perform quick testing for suitability of method to customer use cases. Much lower investment and set up cost compared to traditional bin picking systems. Tested picking success rates suggest that this method is suitable for industrial applications. Mtc’s ability to create simulated training data allows for this technique to be adapted quickly to more difficult to pick parts. ","MTC"

Its unique system, where tiles self-align and interlock without nails or screws, has been designed to significantly improve speed of installation, subsequently reducing resource levels, as well as production and labour costs. Initially each roof tile was being made by hand, so carapace slate wanted to introduce automation to the manufacturing process to significantly improve productivity and reduce the need for manual intervention, whilst still retaining the key components of the tile design. ","At the start of the project, the pmi and design and build teams at the mtc, in partnership with innovate uk, spent time onsite at carapace slate to understand the processes and potential challenges with implementing an automated manufacturing process.

In 2019, in response to growing demand and a commitment to providing its customers with greater flexibility and productivity, the organisation began construction on a new, purpose-built 20,000ft² foundry. To support the delivery of the new facility, mrt castings approached the mtc to advise on the factory layout and equipment selection, technology solutions to introduce automation and robotic handling. ","An sme team from the mtc's manufacturing support services (mss) operation worked closely with managers and operators from mrt castings to help plan the layout for the new foundry.  3d modelling and visualisation were used based on data from existing and proposed equipment, which enabled visuals to be laid out within the architectural plans.  Workshops were then held using virtual reality technology to enable mrt castings' staff to view, adapt and optimise the layout before construction was completed. The mtc then provided a technology roadmap to support the introduction of automation and robotic loading solutions for the facility's cnc machining centres. 3d printing approaches were also developed for manufacturing bespoke grippers for the automated loading cells. ","Mrt castings' new foundry opened in march 2020.  Through the work of the mtc, staff were engaged throughout the facility design process, which helped to encourage internal buy-in and ease of adoption of new technologies. As an independent rto, the mtc were able to provide impartial advice to ensure the proposed solutions met the specific needs of the business; specifically, improved productivity and agility, and a first-class manufacturing environment utilising the latest technology. The project also resulted in knowledge transfer and skill development of mrt staff in new subject areas including robotics and design tools.  This was also supported by site visits to the mtc. The project delivery met the original objectives outlined by mrt castings, including budget, timescales, space utilisation, targeted productivity levels and support in futureproofing the business's activity moving forwards. Mrt castings are now exploring future projects with the mtc, including the potential development of in-house additive manufacturing capabilities. ","Increased manufacturing productivity and improved agility to respond to changing demands and new opportunities e. G.  Component parts for ventilators in response to covid-19 pandemic. Expansion of knowledge and skills amongst workforce. Speed of project implementation enhanced by support from the mtc and its network of partners, delivered within 16 weeks.

"Teleoperation With Haptic Feedback and Virtual Reality Training for Hazardous Environments","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/teleoperation-with-haptic-feedback-and-virtual-reality-training-for-hazardous-environments/","The technologies utilised on the project can improve the safety of operations in hazardous environments, with the potential to remove the need for traditional manual glove box processes. Many industrial sectors, including the nuclear industry, are facing the challenge of manual labour-intensive operations in hazardous environments.  Operators are often required to wear full respiratory systems and can only work for a very limited time, with some operations being too dangerous for human intervention.  The development of scalable, human-controlled robotic applications, with immersive control has the potential to significantly increase the safety of potentially unsafe processes, and improve productivity. ","Working together with the nuclear industry, the mtc has developed a teleoperated robotic handling demonstrator, deployed in a glove box mock-up. Intuitive operator controls rely on multiple camera feeds and haptic control allows the user to feel grasping forces and the interaction between the robot and environment or assets. A virtual training simulator mode utilises the same control interface as the real system and provides a platform for operators to be trained in a de-risked, virtual environment. ","Evaluated and demonstrated the successful use of haptic teleoperation in hazardous and confined environments. Performed a comprehensive series of tests to evaluate different operator interface and control methods. Designed as a cost-effective option for industry that can be embedded into mature, bespoke configurations. A scalable solution that enables a wide range of operations in different processes from handling, to more complex assembly processes. This project has the potential to be embedded into an automated, or autonomous process due to its human shared autonomy. ","Innovative technology that can aid with future development and deployment, and can be further de-risked into an industrial application. Operators can perform complex operations from a safe, remote location. Using a de-risked virtual simulator, operators can receive training on new processes and environments.

This project has also received support from the high value manufacturing catapult.  Original production unitshigh value manufacturing catapult. ","In collaboration with partners, an improvement has been made to the vacuum form tooling design, enabling production of robust shields with improved consistency in wall thickness, and better surface finish and optical clarity. At just under 4. 5kg the new units also offer a considerable reduction in weight.  This means the shield is more than 50 percent lighter than its original 9kg counterpart, making it easier and safer for healthcare professionals to handle.  The improved design allows the shields to be stacked on top of one another, reducing the amount of storage space required when the units are not in use, and reduces transport costs for distribution. The mtc has commissioned tooling to produce repeatable, highly accurate silicone parts for the shield access flaps with reduced cost per unit.  Significant work has also been carried out to design and develop an improved fastener that meets the requirements of a secure connection, ease of assembly, part-count reduction, and reduction in ‘dirt-traps’ which makes cleaning the interior of the shield easier.

Changing the process even slightly can require major investment and this limits manufacturers ability to be flexible and agile. The challenge of this project was to show that through effective deployment of machine learning technology a low cost assembly system can be created to adapt reactively to the locations of input parts thus eliminating costly fixturing and potentially enabling future human-robot collaboration. ","An example product was created to mimic a typical electronic assembly comprising 5 unique components.

Pmi, along with the mtc’s design and build team, took up the challenge. The frames, which help individuals to stand supported for periods of time, are used to aid rehabilitation, and can bring about important health benefits that can’t be achieved in seated positions.  However, the current standing frames have a number of limitations.  Each frame is bespoke to the user, with limited ability to re-adapt for another patient; consequently, the product lifespan is relatively short and therefore less cost effective.  The cost to manufacture is also a factor to address, as is the ease of use by a medical professional and/or carer to support patients getting in and out of the frame.  A lot of standing frame users are also children, and anecdotal feedback is that the frames look ‘intimidating’ and ‘too industrial’, and that once in the frames, patients are unable to carry out activities that would help distract and entertain whilst standing e. G.  Arts and crafts, playing with toys, baking etc.  In working with the mtc, orlau set out a series of objectives for the new design concept:.

"Development of Additive Manufacturing Powder Specifications","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/development-of-additive-manufacturing-powder-specifications/","Additive manufacturing (am) uses powder as its raw material feedstock.  It is known that the powder characteristics will impact on the quality of the final am components.  Historically characterisation of metal powders has been limited to rudimentary techniques such as sieving and flow through an orifice.  These techniques offer limited opportunity to develop powder specifications that are adequate for am process control.  Furthermore, sourcing am powders is a non-trivial task due to the multiple supply chain options available.  The challenge here was to assess the quality of powders, atomised in europe, using advanced powder characterisation techniques, to select the most appropriate suppliers and to develop new specifications for enhanced control over powders used in am technologies. ","Within the fp7 european funded amaze ii programme the mtc were tasked with completing a market assessment to identify european powder suppliers capable of producing the required alloy compositions.  Procured powders were submitted to the mtc’s advanced powder characterisation laboratory for analysis to fully quantify the differences between powders procured from various suppliers.  The analysis was based on; (1) bulk packing and flow behavior, (2) particle size and morphology, and (3) chemical composition.  To ensure equivalent testing conditions all samples were conditioned prior to testing and testing was conducted in a relative humidity controlled environment. ","Assessment of powders procured from various european powder suppliers has demonstrated that powder characteristics do vary from supplier to supplier even when powders are atomised via the same method and supplied as ‘nominally’ the same grade.  The initial powder characterisation work was used to inform the development of powder specifications.  All incoming powders, which are accepted for am processing, will have been quality assured against these specifications ensuring that a consistent raw powder feedstock is used throughout the programme.  The powder characterisation results were fed back to powder suppliers allowing them to learn from the analysis","Detailed understanding of the natural variation observed in powder batches procured from different suppliers.

","The techniques developed by the joint engineering team resulted in manufacturing processes that kept quality high and manufacturing costs down.  The process steps and details have been captured in a set of standard operating procedures for engineers and machinists.  These can be used for reference or training.  The innovative technologies employed have allowed arrowsmith to produce components that could previously not be made to the standard of accuracy and quality achieved. ","Arrowsmith has increased its standing with its customers as a competitive and innovative supplier. Arrowsmith has a workforce with a higher skill level and a better understanding of the process and the effects of variables. Arrowsmith is better placed to win new work as a technology leader in its field. In addition, it has made significant improvements in quality, and by reducing manufacturing waste has reduced its costs.

While the aerospace primes are seen to be investing heavily in new technologies, it's really important that the supply chain keeps up.  Advanced engines need advanced engineering solutions at every stage, so this research is crucial for the industry.  By working collaboratively, we're improving the quality and scope of that research, while upskilling our own engineers and sharing our expertise.

"Immersive visualisation for architectural design","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/immersive-visualisation-for-architectural-design/","Traditionally, the architectural design industry uses pre-rendered visuals or scale models to communicate their designs to clients and stakeholders.  Whilst this can provide a reasonable representation of concept designs for presentations, there are still situations where technology can provide a greater level of understanding, realism and collective appreciation for the designers and clients. The challenge here was for the team at hickman & smith architects to effectively present their proposed designs to their client, utilising their own 3d dataset, in such a way that the client could make efficient, visual-based decisions. ","The mtc virtual reality cave system presented an opportunity for hickman & smith architects to fully communicate their design and allow the client to experience it as if it were real. Utilising the ic. Ido vr software from esi, the 3d architectural design was imported into the fully immersive environment.  By utilising a combination of head-tracking and 3d stereo visuals, the client was able to interact with the building in a very natural way and systematically ‘walk’ the spaces, offering comment or proposed design changes on the fly. Using vr as a design tool assists the process of identifying cost savings earlier in the design stages and, therefore, reduces the need for expensive variations once the project is on site.

"Immersive visualisation for collaborative construction projects","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/immersive-visualisation-for-collaborative-construction-projects/","Large construction projects require detailed involvement and input from multiple parties throughout the various stages; including architects, consultants, contractors and of course, the client.  This in itself presents a challenge when efficient collaboration is necessary in order to achieve the desired results, on time and on budget.  The impact of late design changes, or missed issues, can be significant, so identifying these earlier in the design stages is critical. With multiple new build projects being run at the mtc site, the architects, fdg and consultants, gleeds were interested in using 3d building information modelling (bim) to apply 3d visualisation workflows to the design stages, in order to identify and resolve any potential issues and help with the decision- making process. ","The mtc’s virtual reality cave system provided the ideal solution to allow the architects and consultants to present and approve their designs with the mtc management team. The immersive visualisation environment provided the team with the ability to experience the virtual model as if it were real, by utilising a combination of head-tracking and 3d stereo visuals within the cave.  Using the ic. Idovr software from esi, the visualisation/vr team collated the various 3d datasets to build a complete site model that could then be used for a range of visual design reviews; everything from site planning, to detailed internal layouts.  This also provided the opportunity to acquire design and operation input from other teams including facilities management, catering, management staff and health and safety. ","The result of this work was ultimately the creation of a more reliable set of construction designs earlier in the design stage, matching the mtc’s requirements more closely.  The construction and client teams were quickly able to gain a common understanding of the designs and identify any potential issues by interrogating the 3d models in a very intuitive and natural environment.  The process has also resulted in changes that have contributed to improved building designs and overall optimisation of the mtc campus. ","Faster and more effective decision-making resulting in a 20% reduction in project design timescales. More efficient use of time and materials, giving a 10-fold return on investment from the use of the facility. Early identification of issues and required changes before any significant investments.

The mtc is currently going through a fast period of growth and the ansty site developments have required us to work closely with the architects and consultants on the building designs and internal layouts.  This process has significantly benefited from the use of our vr system in helping us to fully understand and approve the designs in a much shorter timeframe.

"New software improves the accuracy of automated shot-peening process","https://www.the-mtc.org/case-studies/new-software-improves-the-accuracy-of-automated-shot-peening-process/","Sandwell's customers - which includes formula one racing teams - require a very fast turnaround of parts finished to a high quality.  Some of these parts may be designed and manufactured in days before being fitted to race cars for the next event. Being near the end of the production process means that sandwell is often the last process in the chain before the part is fitted, necessitating a fast response. ","To speed up processing, sandwell introduced an automatic shot-peening system consisting of a robotic booth and surface scanning system, combined with rapid programming to accommodate diverse and changing demands.  Working together, engineers from sandwell and the mtc identified a process in which parts can be geometrically scanned and a cad model created from this scan.  Although this is proven technology, mtc engineers have taken it a step further by developing a process in which the robot's path is automatically determined by the scanned geometry. ","The new processes were proved on the mtc's own equipment, replicating that used by sandwell.  The processes were transferred to sandwell's robotic system where they have proved that rapid robot path creation can be carried out from scanned geometry with very little input from operators. The result is a much faster response time, a fully automated and efficient process, and a high level of accuracy. ","Sandwell is now able to respond to demanding industries with faster response times. Sandwell's shot-peening process is more efficient, with more precise programming of the robotic operation. Sandwell's high precision techniques have opened up opportunities in other sectors. The use of automated equipment reduces the need for highly specialised programmers.
