"Essays on FinTech Lending","https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa59499","HAOFENG XU","2021","The three essays in the thesis provide some novel explanations and perspectives regarding the structure of FinTech lending: including the impact of legal enforcement on the FinTech framework, the role of verification in FinTech credit and the effect of crowdsourced reviews on the FinTech lending industry. In “Legal Enforcement and FinTech Innovations: International Evidence”, using 5,540,449 FinTech loan-level observations across 24 countries, we first find loan interest rates are significantly lower when borrowers’ jurisdictions exhibit stronger legal enforcement. Importantly, we find that the call for legal protection on FinTech credit is less pressing when loans are issued by platforms with better risk-sharing innovations, and when borrowers’ jurisdictions have high information-sharing intensity. To establish causality, we apply the difference-in-differences method by using the country-level staggered adoption of good practices that promote court quality and efficiency, as exogenous shocks to enforceability. Our study contributes to the debate on the role of legal protection in FinTech credit market by interacting with FinTech innovations. In “Crowdsourced reviews and FinTech Lending Industry”, this chapter examines the extent to which crowdsourced reviews predict FinTech platform performance and survival probability. We conduct textual analysis of 152,676 reviews published on one of the most popular FinTech information providers between 2015 and 2019. We find that negative sentiment predicts lower trading volume, fewer investors, and fewer loans in a FinTech platform. This result is robust to a series of sensitivity tests and is more prominent that we apply the difference-in-differences approach to establish causality. Moreover, we observe that informative negative reviews are related to worse platform performance while informative positive reviews do not seem to matter. Further analysis uncovers that FinTech platforms experiencing increases in negative reviews are significantly less likely to survive. Our study suggests that crowdsourced review is an important component that could be considered in regulating the FinTech marketplace. In “The Role of Verification in FinTech Lending”, using data from a leading Chinese FinTech lending platform from 2012 to 2015, we investigate the role of verification in the FinTech lending market. We find that borrowers with thorough and complete verification are more likely to obtain funding and also less likely to default on loans. We also find that borrowers that have incomplete verification are more likely to upwardly misrepresent their income. This leads to higher default rates for this group when compared to the default rates of more thoroughly verified borrowers. The further analysis documents that returning borrowers are more likely to maintain a good credit record. We discuss the implications of our findings for the role of verification in the growing FinTech lending sector and the design of a stable financial system.","Tech","Swansea University"

In general, knowledge regarding any particular fact helps consumers to select or reject different options. Therefore, knowledge regarding financial services is considered a factor that influences access to financial technology services. This study carries out a survey-oriented method with a structured questionnaire. According to the data category, this study uses three well-known econometric models: logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log–log regression, have been experimented. This study finds that knowledge regarding various factors significantly impact on access to financial technology services. Mainly, this study has important practical significance for the use of rural finance and financial technology in rural areas, which affects the entire economy.","Tech","Swansea University"

"Lidar Remote Sensing for Biomass Assessment","https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa15575","Jacqueline Rosette","2012","This research employs the concept of social capital to compare the efforts that a range of tech companies have claimed to take to counter polarization and extremism and build resilience on their platforms. The dataset on which our analysis is based is made-up of a purposive sample of official blog posts from three ‘older’ (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and three ‘newer’ (i.e., TikTok, Discord, and Telegram) technology platforms. The selected posts focused on companies’ efforts to make their platform safer, build community resilience, counter violent extremism and/or polarization, or mentioned related topics such as countering hate organizations, radicalization, or misinformation. Revealed were seven themes incorporating, to a greater or lesser extent, the three main types of social capital (i.e., bonding, bridging and linking). These themes were granting user powers, strengthening existing communities, provision of information and education, building community, enhancing user rights, keeping users safe, and building trust and relationships with users. Analysis of these showed that while creation of all three types of social capital was apparent, similar to previous studies, bridging capital dominated here too; while there were some discrepancies between social capital generating activities and their framings on ‘older’ versus ‘newer’ platforms, other factors, including platform size and company values are likely to be equally or more important; and, finally, that companies attempts at generating online social capital can have negative as well as positive impacts with regard to countering polarization and extremism.","Tech","Swansea University"

"Cytokines and the Innate Immune Response at the Materno-Fetal Interface","https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa20924","Aled Bryant","2012","Scholars have been arguing for years that responses to terrorist content on tech platforms have, to-date, been inadequate. Past responses have been reactive and fragmented with tech platforms self-regulating. Over the last few years, many governments began to decide that the self-regulatory approach was not working. As a result, a number of regulatory frameworks have been proposed and/or implemented. However, they have been highly criticised. The purpose of this thesis is to propose a new regulatory framework to counter terrorist content on tech platforms and overcome many of these criticisms. Scholars have argued that it is vital that future regulation be informed by past experience and supported by evidence from prior research. Therefore, a number of steps were taken. First, this thesis examines a review of literature into what platforms are exploited by terrorist organisations. Next, a content analysis was undertaken on blogposts that tech platforms publish in order to investigate the efforts that tech platforms report making to counter terrorist content on their services and the challenges that they face. Third, a sample of existing or currently proposed regulatory frameworks were examined in order to learn what was done well and what gaps, limitations and challenges exist that require addressing in future regulation. Finally, social regulation theory was identified as applicable in this regulatory context. Social regulation strategies were examined in three other regulatory contexts in order to examine whether they could be used in this regulatory context. The findings from the above analyses were used to inform a new regulatory framework that is proposed in this thesis. In addition to proposing a new regulatory framework, this thesis also identified three compliance issues that tech platforms may face. These compliance issues are addressed alongside the proposal of the framework. Overall, it is argued that previous regulatory attempts failed to consider the diverse array of challenges that are faced by different platforms when countering terrorist content. The regulatory framework proposed in this thesis researched these challenges and identified strategies from a social regulation approach, learning lessons from how they were applied elsewhere to overcome some of the key criticisms and limitations of existing regulatory practice.","Tech","Swansea University"
