"Highways, law and governance: Parish of Halifax, c.1550-1700","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/highways-law-and-governance(2e7e2afc-f57d-4a5f-8358-64c3dd2a0a36).html","Seccombe, M.","2025","Transport historians have made an increasingly strong case for connectivity and mobility in Stuart England even before the introduction of turnpike trusts in the eighteenth century. There has, however, been little explanation of how this was achieved at local level, nor has the broader historiography of government in this period given infrastructure the attention it merits, since the painstaking, but dated, research, of the Webbs. This study explores the diversity of approaches to the administration of highway infrastructure by the townships of Halifax parish in addressing a range of travel and transport needs on foot and horseback in an upland area largely inaccessible to wheeled vehicles. The research is concerned with how townships managed their highways, who the officeholders were, how they negotiated relationships with other agents and institutions, and the implications of a reconceptualisation of the highways function for current debates on state formation. Exploiting excellent manorial and township records, the analysis takes advantage of GIS mapping techniques to re-evaluate the governance of highways, as townships in the parish responded to statutory, political and socio-economic change. A review of the legal framework shows how the Tudor co-option of manorial courts for monitoring statutory compliance resulted in a hybrid system of tenurial liability and communal obligation. Broad-based participation was subject to increasing middling-sort assertiveness, and records from Sowerby township testify to precocious funding of maintenance from the constables’ rates, supervised by a powerful vestry. Economic activities, such as pastoral agriculture, textile manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and the service sector were significant drivers of road management priorities. The research argues that manorial and township institutions deserve more recognition for creative and effective solutions to problems of access and connectivity through presentment routines. Success in managing highways in the parish depended on the participation of better-off landholders both as officeholders and in discharging individual and collective obligations for maintenance and cleansing. The institutions of manor and vestry provided legitimacy to the governance of the highways function, and thereby contributed to the resilience of the seventeenth-century state.","Tech","University of Lancaster"
"Measurements and Modeling of the Interhemispheric Differences of Atmospheric Chlorinated Very Short-Lived Substances","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/measurements-and-modeling-of-the-interhemispheric-differences-of-atmospheric-chlorinated-very-shortlived-substances(fa7fe73b-0077-43ea-89c0-270a2fa6c691).html","Hossaini, R.","28/01/2024","Chlorinated very short-lived substances (Cl-VSLS) are ubiquitous in the troposphere and can contribute to the stratospheric chlorine budget. In this study, we present measurements of atmospheric dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), tetrachloroethene (C2Cl4), chloroform (CHCl3), and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) obtained during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) global-scale aircraft mission (2016?2018), and use the Community Earth System Model (CESM) updated with recent chlorine chemistry to further investigate their global tropospheric distribution. The measured global average Cl-VSLS mixing ratios, from 0.2 to 13 km altitude, were 46.6 ppt (CH2Cl2), 9.6 ppt (CHCl3), 7.8 ppt (1,2-DCA), and 0.84 ppt (C2Cl4) measured by the NSF NCAR Trace Organic Analyzer (TOGA) during ATom. Both measurements and model show distinct hemispheric gradients with the mean measured Northern to Southern Hemisphere (NH/SH) ratio of 2 or greater for all four Cl-VSLS. In addition, the TOGA profiles over the NH mid-latitudes showed general enhancements in the Pacific basin compared to the Atlantic basin, with up to ?18 ppt difference for CH2Cl2 in the mid troposphere. We tagged regional source emissions of CH2Cl2 and C2Cl4 in the model and found that Asian emissions dominate the global distributions of these species both at the surface (950 hPa) and at high altitudes (150 hPa). Overall, our results confirm relatively high mixing ratios of Cl-VSLS in the UTLS region and show that the CESM model does a reasonable job of simulating their global abundance but we also note the uncertainties with Cl-VSLS emissions and active chlorine sources in the model. These findings will be used to validate future emission inventories and to investigate the fast convective transport of Cl-VSLS to the UTLS region and their impact on stratospheric ozone.","Tech","University of Lancaster"
"The influence of H2O or/and O2 introduction during the low-temperature gas-phase sulfation of organic COS + CS2 on the conversion and deposition of sulfur-containing species in the sulfated CeO2-OS catalyst for NH3-SCR","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-influence-of-h2o-orand-o2introduction-during-the-lowtemperature-gasphase-sulfation-of-organic-cos--cs2on-the-conversion-and-deposition-of-sulfurcontaining-species-in-the-sulfated-ceo2os-catalyst-for-nh3scr(6c561490-d58d-439b-afda-d407498c7f69).html","Du, Y.","24/01/2024","Herein, the typical components of blast furnace gas, including H O and O , were introduced to improve the NH -SCR activity of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst during the gas-phase sulfation of organic COS + CS at 50 °C. The characterization results demonstrate that the introduction of O or H O during gas-phase sulfation enhances the conversion of organic COS + CS on a cubic fluorite CeO surface and reduces the formation of sulfur and sulfates in the catalyst, but decreases the BET surface area and pore volume of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst. However, the introduction of O or H O during the gas-phase sulfation increases the molar ratios of Ce /(Ce + Ce ) and O /(O + O + O ) on the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst surface, thus promoting the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and chemisorbed oxygen, and these properties of the catalyst are further enhanced by the co-existence of O and H O. Furthermore, the reduction of sulfates formed under the action of O or H O decreases the weak acid sites of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst, but the few and highly dispersive sulfates present stronger reducibility, and the proportion of medium-strong acid sites of the catalyst increases. These factors help to improve the NH -SCR activity of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst. Thus, there exists a synergistic effect of H O and O introduction during gas-phase sulfation on the physical-chemical properties and catalytic performance of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst by organic COS + CS at 50 °C.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Among the many devices that have been developed, silicon APDs stand out because of their low cost, performance stability, and compatibility with CMOS. However, the increasing industrial needs pose challenges for the fabrication cycle time and fabrication cost. In this work, we proposed an improved fabrication process for ultra-deep mesa-structured silicon APDs for photodetection in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths with improved performance and reduced costs. The improved process reduced the complexity through significantly reduced photolithography steps, e.g., half of the steps of the existing process. Additionally, single ion implantation was performed under low energy (lower than 30 keV) to further reduce the fabrication costs. Based on the improved ultra-concise process, a deep-mesa silicon APD with a 140 V breakdown voltage was obtained. The device exhibited a low capacitance of 500 fF, the measured rise time was 2.7 ns, and the reverse bias voltage was 55 V. Moreover, a high responsivity of 103 A/W@870 nm at 120 V was achieved, as well as a low dark current of 1 nA at punch-through voltage and a maximum gain exceeding 1000.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

While HAT, caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense or gambiense, has shown record low cases in recent years, the elimination of AAT remains difficult due to many complicating factors. One of these factors is the comparatively poor understanding of the main causative agent of AAT, Trypanosoma congolense. Both T. brucei and T. congolense possess a single flagellum that originates from inside the cell and exits through a membrane invagination called the flagellar pocket. The flagellar pocket and its associated structures are not only critical for parasite survival and virulence but also for coordinating the cell cycle. Improving our understanding of cell cycle regulation in these species could lead to novel drug targets, which could be aided by utilisation of a suitable synchronisation method. This project aims to optimise protocols for both the synchronisation and enrichment of flagellar pocket associated cytoskeletal structures (F-PACS) in African trypanosomes to provide opportunities for greater analysis of the cell cycle. To synchronise T. brucei, centrifugal counter-flow elutriation (CCE) was used to separate cells based on their hydrodynamic volume. Enriched fractions were collected containing >97% of cells in G1 in PCF, and >98% in BSF. Once returned to culture, this population continued to grow in a synchronous fashion. A protocol for enrichment of F-PACS in PCF T. brucei was optimised. Synchronised samples were generated for analysis of changes in phosphosite abundance across the cell cycle. Attempts were made to optimize mechanical and chemical synchronisation techniques for use on T. congolense, achieving a ~76% enrichment in G1 by CCE. This project provides useful optimisations for continued study of the cell cycle in trypanosomes. ","Tech","University of Lancaster"

The March 1989 storm is also scaled to estimate a 1-in-100 year and a 1-in-200 year extreme storm. Both the Glasgow to Edinburgh line, and the Preston to Lancaster section of the West Coast Main Line are modelled. No “right side” failures (when unoccupied sections appear occupied) are suggested to have occurred during either storm, and the total number of potential “wrong side” failures (when occupied sections appear clear) is low. However, the modelling indicates “right side” and “wrong side” failures are possible on both routes during the 1-in-100 year and 1-in-200 year extreme storms, with the Glasgow to Edinburgh line showing more total misoperations than the Preston to Lancaster section of the West Coast Main Line. A 1-in-100 year or 1-in-200 year extreme storm would result in misoperations over an extended period of time, with most occurring over a duration of 2–3 h either side of the peak of the storm.","Tech","University of Lancaster"
"Technostress in University Lecturers: An Exploratory Study Using the Job Demands-Resources Theory","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/technostress-in-university-lecturers(3075c73b-4f71-4250-ad59-92946ae570a1).html","None","18/01/2024","University lecturers are expected to engage with a range of workplace information and computing technologies (ICTs) to fulfil teaching, learning, assessment, administrative and research responsibilities. This cross-sectional, survey-based, study addresses the need highlighted in recent literature for the investigation of the effects of technostress on university lecturers.  Technostress arises when the individual finds it challenging to manage workplace ICT-related demands, leading to negative effects for both the individual worker and their employer organisation.   Framed within the Job Demands-Resources Theory, the study described here explored ICT-associated technostress as a job demand in higher education workplaces, as experienced by a sample of Irish university lecturers (N=77).  The relationship between technostress creators and lecturer well-being and work performance was explored. The potential moderating effect of technostress inhibitors in mitigating against these potential negative effects of technostress was also examined.Quantitative analysis findings suggest that Irish university lecturers experience the following technostress creators: techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-complexity and techno-insecurity.  No significant participant age, gender, or education level-related differences in these scores were identified. Hypothesis testing showed that techno-overload and techno-complexity negatively predict work performance, and positively predict work-related burnout, which was also shown to be positively predicted by techno-invasion.   Work-related burnout negatively predicted work performance, but only mediated the relationship between techno-invasion and work performance.  Analysis of the mitigating role of technostress inhibitors delivered mixed results, with some findings suggesting that technostress inhibitors potentially magnify, instead of reducing, the negative effects of technostress creators. These quantitative findings were supported by participant narrative contributions about the use of ICTs in higher education workplaces. These narratives supported the discussion of the quantitative analysis results, while also informing recommendations for academic managers regarding organisational measures that can be adopted to identify, and mitigate against, the negative effects of technostress for both university lecturers and their employer universities.

As single or multiple molecules serve as crucial building blocks for designing and constructing molecular electronic devices, comprehending their electronic and transport properties becomes imperative. Countless theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to create molecular junctions and explore their electrical performance. This thesis focuses on fundamental aspects of transport theory, employing theoretical and mathematical approaches to investigate electron transport through junctions, particularly involving a scattering region formed by a singlemolecule connected to metal electrodes. The research methods used are based on a combination of density functional theory, implemented within the SIESTA code, and non-equilibrium Green's function, realized using the GOLLUM code, to delve into electrical conductance on a molecular scale.The objective of this chapter is to address a puzzling paradox concerning metaconnectivity, which exhibits destructive quantum interference (DQI) in a tight binding model. However, in certain instances, DQI does not manifest in a DFT calculation on the same system. To shed light on this inconsistency, a selection of molecules is examined, focusing on the distinction between meta and para connectivity. Two different types of linkers, thiol (-SH) and methyl sulphide (-SMe), are employed to couple different molecules to Au electrodes. Through this investigation, we aim to gain insights into the underlying factors that lead to the observed quantum interferencebehaviors.In project two, we conducted a comprehensive study, combining experimental and theoretical approaches, to explore charge transport in stacked graphene-like dimers. Our findings revealed that the interaction between room-temperature quantum interference and stacking significantly influences their highly non-classical electrical conductance. Notably, for the molecule CQI-L, the electrical conductance of the dimer exceeds that of the monomer by a remarkable factor of 25, attributed to the most energetically favorable stacking interactions. Conversely, for the molecule CQI-H, the dimer's conductance is approximately 40 times lower than that of the monomer. These resultsunequivocally demonstrate that precise control of connectivity to molecular cores, coupled with stacking interactions between their systems, provides a versatile avenue for modifying and optimizing charge transfer between molecules. This discovery is expected to inspire further vigorous research at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

There is a growing trend to deploy Cloud CDNs (CCDNs) to provide more flexibility compared to traditional CDNs. Today, regardless of the current technological advancements, most CCDNs still make their resource and cache management decisions while being unaware of what Content Providers (CPs) want to achieve. For instance, the APIs of prominent CCDNs (such as Amazon CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, and Microsoft Azure CDN) do not allow CPs to express their high-level targets, e.g., requests/region. Instead, CPs are mainly limited to specifying the desired geographical coverage and the origin content server. Fortunately, there has been an increasing interest in the Intent-Based Networking (IBN) paradigm, which aims to allow users to express what they want to do (in the form of an intent) instead of how to do it. By employing IBN, CCDNs could move towards a communication scheme that is more adaptive, flexible, and portable,that tries to automate meeting the CP’s intent target throughout the pre- and postdeployment phases of a service.In this thesis, we present a solution to enable such Intent-Based CCDN. Weillustrate how microservices modularity could be utilized in the intent translationprocess, decomposing intents into behavioral abstract policies that in turn gettranslated into technical realizations as microservices. This provides a more flexible, cost-effective, interoperable solution, and enables stakeholders to compare and alternate between microservice alternatives depending on the CP’s intent. We propose and implement a Low-Cost Intent (LCI) that targets cost reduction while provisioning a CCDN.We evaluate several realizations of this LCI, namely LCI1, LCI2 and LCI3 via selecting different microservice alternatives (i.e., leading to different overall CCDN deployments) for each. Additionally, we propose and implement different LCI refinement algorithms for performance improvement in various traffic scenarios. We conduct our evaluation experiments on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and test it using traces of real CDN traffic obtained from a major ISP. Evaluating our refined LCI different realizations against a baseline of GKE demonstrated the differences between these varying options. The best was LCI1 which reduced infrastructure cost by up to 10% in return for a 2% rise in dropped requests. On the other hand, although LCI2 also led to cost reduction up to 10%, it caused an increased request drops by almost 20%. Finally LCI3 led to the highest infrastructure cost reduction by up to 20% but in return for the highest rise in dropped requests by 40%. Interestingly, in a traffic bursts scenario, although the refined LCI resulted no cost reduction, it actually outperformed the baseline by reducing the amount of dropped requests by 30%. Accordingly, we discuss the factors that led to these different variations between the different LCI flavors based on their corresponding selected microservice alternatives.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

This study aims to examine nitrogen-enriched novel biochar co-composts prepared from rice straw, maize stover, and gram residue in various mixing ratios of the biochar and their feedstock materials for the amelioration of acidic tropical soil. Three pristine biochar and six co-composts were prepared, characterized, and evaluated for improving the chemical and biological quality of the soil against a conventional lime treatment. The pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), calcium carbonate equivalence (CCE) and nitrogen content of co-composts varied between 7.78–8.86, 25.3–30.5 cmol (p               +) kg               −1, 25.5–30.5%, and 0.81–1.05%, respectively. The co-compost prepared from gram residue biochar mixed with maize stover at a 1:7 dry-weight ratio showed the highest rise in soil pH and CEC, giving an identical performance with the lime treatment and significantly better effect (p <.05) than the unamended control. Agglomerates of calcite and dolomite in biochar co-composts, and surface functional groups contributed to pH neutralization and increased CEC of the amended soil. The co-composts also significantly (p <.05) increased the dehydrogenase (1.87 µg TPF g                −1 soil h               −1), β-glucosidase (90 µg PNP g               −1 soil h               −1), and leucine amino peptidase (3.22 µmol MUC g               −1 soil h               −1) enzyme activities in the soil, thereby improving the soil’s biological quality.

J.","15/01/2024","The impacts of precipitation change on forest carbon (C) storage will have global consequences, as forests play a major role in sequestering anthropogenic CO . Although forest soils are one of the largest terrestrial C pools, there is great uncertainty around the response of forest soil organic carbon (SOC) to precipitation change, which limits our ability to predict future forest C storage. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effect of drought and irrigation experiments on SOC pools, plant C inputs and the soil environment based on 161 studies across 139 forest sites worldwide. Overall, forest SOC content was not affected by precipitation change, but both drought and irrigation altered plant C inputs and soil properties associated with SOC formation and storage. Drought may enhance SOC stability by altering soil aggregate fractions, but the effect of irrigation on SOC fractions remains unexplored. The apparent insensitivity of SOC to precipitation change can be explained by the short duration of most experiments and by biome-specific responses of C inputs and pools to drought or irrigation. Importantly, we demonstrate that SOC content is more likely to decline under irrigation at drier temperate sites, but that dry forests are currently underrepresented across experimental studies. Thus, our meta-analysis advances research into the impacts of precipitation change in forests by revealing important differences among forest biomes, which are likely linked to plant adaptation to extant conditions. We further demonstrate important knowledge gaps around how precipitation change will affect SOC stability, as too few studies currently consider distinct soil C pools. To accurately predict future SOC storage in forests, there is an urgent need for coordinated studies of different soil C pools and fractions across existing sites, as well as new experiments in underrepresented forest types.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

However, enhancements to PUREX are needed for future fuel cycles to improve its proliferation resistance, its capability to handle higher burnup fuels and to minimize its waste arisings. A key objective within the development of an Advanced PUREX process is the effective control of the actinides U, neptunium (Np) and Pu within a single cycle flowsheet. Simple hydroxamic acids such as acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) have the abilityto strip Pu(IV) and Np(IV) from tri-butyl phosphate into nitric acid and have thus been identified as suitable reagents for this purpose. Utilising this in an Advanced PUREX process will ultimately allow for the generation of a co-processed Pu/Np product and a high purity U product, addressing some of the shortcomings of traditional PUREX.There are however a few key knowledge gaps that must be addressed before AHA can be implemented in such a process. Firstly, it is known that simple hydroxamic acids hydrolyse to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the parent carboxylic acid in acidic media, the former product being known to react autocatalytically / explosively with nitric acid which is ubiquitous in reprocessing flowsheets. Whether the reaction mechanism or product distribution changes when the AHA is complexed to a metal ion is unclear. Additionally,observations that Pu(IV) is reduced to Pu(III) during complex hydrolysis have opened up the possibility of their use as replacements for U(IV)/N2H4 or NH2OH in advanced PUREX processes, but whether the reducing agent is the hydroxamate itself, or NH2OH, is still in question.To answer these questions, Fe(III) has been used as a non-active analogue to Pu(IV) and Np(IV), as it exhibits analogous complexation with AHA and whilst thermodynamically possible, redox chemistry mechanistically analogous to that of Pu(IV) is thought to be kinetically hindered at high hydrogen ion concentrations to the point where it can be ignored on the timescales of AHA hydrolysis. However, initial studies by Raman spectroscopy showed identical AHA hydrolysis products in the absence and presence of initial Fe(III), but with differing final yields. Further quantification techniques were then explored including a titrimetric method for hydroxylamine, UV-Vis spectroscopy fornitrous acid and Fe(II), and ion chromatography (IC) for multiple species, all of which suggested redox chemistry akin to Pu(IV).A library of data to describe these systems has been gathered utilising a single column ion chromatography system to measure a number of key ions over time in nitric acid solutions of varying temperatures and initial Fe(III) and AHA concentrations. These key species include the acetate ion (CH3COO-) and protonated hydroxylamine (NH3OH+) from the hydrolysis of AHA, and the reduced form of the metal ion, Fe(II), which has been not previously been seen during hydrolysis of the Fe(III)-AHA complex. Our analysis therefore shows that the current definition of Fe(III) as a non-oxidizing metal ion with regards to AHA needs revising. Using CH3COOingrowth as a direct measure of AHA loss and assuming redox chemistry of Fe(III) mechanistically analogous to Pu(IV), thesestudies have additionally been combined with kinetic modelling in the software platform gPROMS (General PROcess Modelling System), and have thus provided key insights into the nature of the reducing agent in these systems.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Refining VRM shading and collection was the initial focus, k-means directed shading for vibrational spectroscopy map shading was developed in Chapter 3 and exploration of depth distortion and VRM calibration (Chapter 4). “Cage” scaffolds, designed using the findings from Chapter 4 were then utilised to influence cell behaviour by varying the number of cage beamsto change the scaffold porosity. Altering the porosity facilitated spectroscopyinvestigation into previously observed changes in cell biology alteration in response to porous scaffolds [8]. VRM visualised changed single human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell morphology, providing a complementary technique for machine learning classification. Increased technical rigour justified progression onto in-situ flow chamber for Raman spectroscopy development in Chapter 6, using a Psoriasis (dithranol-HaCaT) model on unfixed cells. K-means-directed shading and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed HaCaT cell adaptations aligning with previous publications [5] and earlier thesis sections. The k-means-directed Raman maps and PCA score plots verified the drug-supplying capacity of the flow chamber, justifying future investigation into VRM and machine learning for monitoring single cells within the flow chamber.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

In the field of education, VR has been introduced as a tool to enhance learning experiences. This thesis presents an exploration of how VR is used from the context of educators and learners. The research employed a mixed-methods approach, including surveying and interviewing educators, and conducting empirical studies to examine engagement, usability, and user behaviour within VR.The results revealed educators are interested in using VR for a wide range ofscenarios, including thought exercises, virtual field trips, and simulations.However, they face several barriers to incorporating VR into their practice, suchas cost, lack of training, and technical challenges.A subsequent study found that virtual reality can no longer be assumed to bemore engaging than desktop equivalents. This empirical study showed thatengagement levels were similar in both VR and non-VR environments, suggesting that the novelty effect of VR may be less pronounced than previously assumed.A study against a VR mind mapping artifact, VERITAS, demonstrated thatcomplex interactions are possible on low-cost VR devices, making VR accessibleto educators and students. The analysis of user behaviour within this VR artifactshowed that quantifiable strategies emerge, contributing to the understanding of how to design for collaborative VR experiences.This thesis provides insights into how the end-users in the education spaceperceive and use VR. The findings suggest that while educators are interested inusing VR, they face barriers to adoption. The research highlights the need todesign VR experiences, with understanding of existing pedagogy, that areengaging with careful thought applied to complex interactions, particularly forcollaborative experiences. This research contributes to the understanding of thepotential of VR in education and provides recommendations for educators anddesigners to enhance learning experiences using VR.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Today, the development of new technologies means that there are advanced tools that can be used to improve our understanding and treatment of PD. One promising tool – indeed, the focus of this thesis – is computational language analysis. By looking at patterns in how people with personality pathology use words, it is possible to gain access into their constellation of thinking, feelings, and behaviours. To date, however, there has been little research at the intersection of verbal behaviour and personality pathology. Accordingly, the central goal of this thesis is to demonstrate how PD can be better understood through the analysis of natural language. This thesis presents three research articles, comprising four empirical studies, that each leverage computational language analysis to better understand personality pathology. Each paper focuses on a distinct core feature of PD, while incorporating language analysis methods: Paper 1 (Study 1) focuses on interpersonal dysfunction; Paper 2 (Studies 2 and 3) focuses on emotion dysregulation; and Paper 3 (Study 4) focuses on behavioural dysregulation (i.e., engagement in suicidality and deliberate self-harm). Findings from this research have generated better understanding of fundamental features of PD, including insight into characterising dimensions of social dysfunction (Paper 1), maladaptive emotion processes that may contribute to emotion dysregulation (Paper 2), and psychosocial dynamics relating to suicidality and deliberate self-harm (Paper 3) in PD. Such theoretical knowledge subsequently has important implications for clinical practice, particularly regarding the potential to inform psychological therapy. More broadly, this research highlights how language can provide implicit and unobtrusive insight into the personality and psychological processes that underlie personality pathology at a large-scale, using an individualised, naturalistic approach.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Growth in industry demands has necessitated BIM inclusion into the higher education (HE) curricula as both a pedagogic and practical objective to prepare and develop aspiring built environment (BE) professionals with the required competence for contemporary practice. However, comprehension of BIM concepts and subsequent development of the skill set required for its application remains overwhelming for students. In mitigating this challenge, adopting appropriate learner-centred strategies has been advocated. Problem-based learning (PBL) is becoming a widespread strategy to address concerns associated with authentic practices. Design/methodology/approach: This paper evaluates the impact of the PBL strategy on students' accelerated learning of BIM based on a case study of 53 undergraduate students in a BIM module. The network analysis and centrality measures were employed in understudying the most applicable BIM skills. Findings: From the analyses, PBL benefits students' knowledge acquisition (cognitive and affective) of BIM concept and development of transferable skills (academic and disciplinary), equipping them with capabilities to become BIM competent and workplace ready for the AEC industry. Originality/value: The BIM pedagogy evolves, and new skillsets emerge. Analytical, communications and collaboration skills remain sacrosanct to delivering BIM modules.

Hydrogen is being recognized as a promising renewable energy carrier to address the intermittency issues associated with renewable energy sources. For hydrogen to become the “ideal” low or zero-carbon energy carrier, its storage and transportation shortcomings must be addressed. This paper will provide the current large-scale green hydrogen storage and transportation technologies, including ongoing worldwide projects and policy direction, an assessment of the different storage and transportation methods (compressed hydrogen storage, liquid hydrogen, blending hydrogen into natural gas pipelines, and ammonia as green hydrogen carrier), as well as economic factors that influence the viability of large-scale green hydrogen storage and transportation. The results of our study highlight several significant findings concerning the cost, challenges, and potential advancements in the green hydrogen storage and transportation field. Our analysis demonstrates that the cost associated with storing and transporting green hydrogen is anticipated to decrease over time due to technological advancements and economies of scale being achieved. However, the commercialization of this technology requires addressing challenges related to storage methods, transportation modes, efficiency optimization, and technology adoption. For example, our research highlights the need for thorough technical and economic evaluations of using salt caverns for hydrogen storage. The efficiency of hydrogen storage and transportation utilizing existing infrastructure, such as storage tanks and natural gas pipelines.

It has led to the creation of an entirely new field within physics called superconductivity; this attracted many of the finest minds in physics whose work in this area produced no less than six Nobel Prizes to date. Zero resistance, together with the expulsion of magnetic fields which was discovered many years later, are the two unique and intriguing properties of superconductors which puzzled scientists’ brains for a proper theoretical explanation of the observed phenomena. However in 1935, the phe-nomenological theory proposed by Fritz and Heinz London (known as the London theory) was the first success in the field, which was followed in the 1950s by another phenomenological theory put forward by Vitaly Ginzburg and Lev Landau. Despite this, a satisfactory microscopic theory for super-conductivity had to wait until 1957 when John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Robert Schrieffer proposed their theory, which was nicknamed the BCS theory in their honour.The more recent discovery of the cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTS) in 1986 gave a new momentum to the field and intensified the search for room temperature superconductors which continues to this day. While this quest is under way, and new theories of superconductivity are being developed, physicists, material scientists and engineers are using superconductors to establish new technologies and build machines, devices and tools with unprecedented properties. Today superconductors are widely used in healthcare, particle accelerators, ultrasensitive instrumentation and microwave engineering and they are being developed for use in many other areas as well. In this review, we will trace the history of superconductors and provide a brief overview into some of the recent applications of superconductivity.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

We hypothesised that geometric (proportional) allometries of cell sizes across tissues and of leaf dimensions would arise due to the coordination of cell development and that of cell functions such as water, nutrient and energy transport, and that cell sizes across tissues would be associated with light‐saturated photosynthetic rate. We tested predictions across 27 globally distributed C3 and C4 grass species grown in a common garden. We found positive relationships among average cell sizes within and across tissues, and of cell sizes with leaf dimensions. Grass leaf anatomical allometries were similar to those of eudicots, with exceptions consistent with the fewer cell layers and narrower form of grass leaves, and the specialised roles of epidermis and bundle sheath in storage and leaf movement. Across species, mean cell sizes in each tissue were associated with light‐saturated photosynthetic rate per leaf mass, supporting the functional coordination of cell sizes. These findings highlight the generality of evolutionary allometries within the grass lineage and their interlinkage with coordinated development and function.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Various strategies have been developed to optimise this challenging reaction at electrode interfaces, but to-date, decoupled electrolysis has not been demonstrated for the reduction of CO2. Decoupled electrolysis aims to use electrochemically-derived charged redox mediators – electrical charge and potential vectors – to separate catalytic product formation from the electrode surface. Utilising an electrochemically generated highly reducing redox mediator; chromium propanediamine tetraacetate, we report the first successful application of decoupled electrolysis to electrochemical CO2 reduction. A study of metals and metal composites found formate to be the most accessible product, with bismuth metal giving the highest selectivity. Copper, tin, gold, nickel and molybdenum carbide heterogeneous catalysts were also investigated, in which cases H2 was found to be the major product, with minor yields of two-electron CO2 reduction products. Subsequent optimisation of the bismuth catalyst achieved a high formate selectivity of 85%. This method represents a radical new approach to CO2 electrolysis, which may be coupled directly with renewable energy storage technology and green electricity.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

A systematic search of online databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Evidence Search and Dynamed was conducted on 13th December 2021, and repeated on 30th October 2022, using appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Eligible studies reported the use of MA to determine hearing thresholds and compared results to conventional pure-tone audiometry (CA).

Two authors independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Adults and children, with and without diagnosis of hearing impairment. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain the mean difference between thresholds measured using MA and CA in dB HL. Searches returned 858 articles. After systematic review, 17 articles including 1032 participants were analysed. The most used software application was Shoebox (6/17) followed by Hearing Test (3/17), then HearTest (2/17). Tablet computers were used in ten studies, smartphones in six, and a computer in one. The mean difference between MA and CA thresholds was 1.36 dB (95% CI, 0.07-2.66, p = 0.04). Significant differences between mobile audiometry (MA) and conventional audiometry (CA) thresholds were observed in thresholds measured at 500Hz, in children, when MA was conducted in a sound booth, and when MA was self-administered. However, these differences did not exceed the clinically significant threshold of 10 decibels (dB). Included studies exhibited high levels of heterogeneity, high risk of bias and low concerns about applicability. MA compares favourably to CA in measuring hearing thresholds and has role in providing access to hearing assessment in situations where CA is not available or feasible. Future studies should prioritize the integration of pure-tone threshold assessment with additional tests, such as Speech Recognition and Digits-in-Noise, for a more rounded evaluation of hearing ability, assesses acceptability and feasibility, and the cost-effectiveness of MA in non-specialist settings.

Tunnels are commonly encountered in subways and mountainous regions. As part of the communication system infrastructure, Leaky CoaXial (LCX) Cable is widely equipped as antenna in tunnels with many advantages. LCX positioning holds great promise as a technology for rail applications in the upcoming B5G (beyond-5G) and 6G eras. This paper focuses on the LCX positioning methodology and proposes two novel algorithms along with a novel communication-positioning integration signal. Firstly, a novel algorithm called Multiple Slot Distinction (MSD) LCX positioning algorithm is proposed. The algorithm utilizes a generated pseudo spectrum to fully utilize the coupled signals radiated from different slots of LCX. This approach offers higher time resolution compared to traditional methods. To further improve the positioning accuracy to centimeter-level and increase the measuring frequency for fast trains, a novel communication-positioning integration signal is designed. It consists of traditional Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) and a significantly low power Fine Ranging Signal (FRS). FRS is configured to be continuous and superposed onto the cellular signal using Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) principle to minimize its interference to communication. A two-stage LCX positioning method is then executed: At the first stage, the closest slot between the receiver and LCX is estimated by the proposed MSD algorithm using PRS; At the second stage, centimeter-level positioning is achieved by tracking the carrier phase of the continuous FRS. This process is assisted by the closest slot estimation, which helps mitigate interference between neighboring slots and eliminate the integer ambiguities. Simulation results show our proposed LCX position methodology outperforms the existing ones and offer great potentials for future implementations.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

In this sense, it constitutes a welcome move away from the traditional rationalist, abstract, and mechanistic modes of approaching ethical decision-making. Within the current engagement, practical wisdom is generally conceptualized, interpreted or read as a form of deliberation or deliberative judgement that is also cognizant of context, situatedness, particularity, lived experience, and so on. We argue that while this way of conceptualizing practical wisdom moves closer to practice in accounting for the concrete and particular reality within which individuals enact ethics, it does not adequately account for practice in the ontological and relational sense posited in practice theories. Practical wisdom conceptualized on the deliberative dimension still retains a higher emphasis on distinct entities (individuals/institutions), reflexive agency, conscious mental states, goal-directed action, and intentionality. In other words, it puts a higher stress on individual wisdom, as opposed to practice or the relational interaction of the individual and social inhering in practice. We offer an alternative conceptualization of practical wisdom based on the dispositional mode of being in the world which is rarely deliberate, intentional, or reflective. Our conceptualization integrates Aristotle’s original ethical framework, which is already embedded in a practice-based ontology, with insights from practice theories to show how practical wisdom is intuitively channelled in the dispositional mode in a given social configuration of virtues/ends.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

"Synergy Evaluation in Mergers and Acquisitions: An Attention-Based-View","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/synergy-evaluation-in-mergers-and-acquisitions(34ae200a-559c-4143-a743-8135d80a7db7).html","Bauer, F.; Friesl, M.","1/01/2024","A core objective of corporate development relates to scope decisions, which regularly involve mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The dominant idea behind M&A is often captured by the umbrella term ‘synergy’. Yet, while performance is the key variable of most M&A studies, how firms arrive at a particular synergetic value for a target firm is not well understood. In this article, we contribute to this body of research. We argue that understanding the determination of synergies in M&A requires a look at the mechanisms that guide managerial attention towards specific valuation practices and synergy types. Specifically, by drawing on the attention-based view of the firm, we show that the evaluation of synergies cannot be divorced from the underlying attention structure in the M&A context and the various valuation practices that constitute different synergy types. Our analysis suggests that synergies often do not reflect the true potential of acquisitions. We reveal that this is due to an attentional crowding-out effect: The congruence of M&A attention structures with valuation practices for functional synergies crowd out the attention allocation to business models and strategic synergies. We describe the characteristics of this crowding-out effect as well as its implications.","Tech","University of Lancaster"
"Approaches to Industry 4.0 implementation for electron beam quality assurance using BeamAssure","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/approaches-to-industry-40-implementation-for-electron-beam-quality-assurance-using-beamassure(3f287ac1-f551-4e31-bb6b-7fb3cc3f925a).html","None","2024","Electron beam welding (EBW) is a complex process used in manufacturing high-value components in the aerospace and nuclear industries. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a fusion of advances in artificial intelligence, sensing techniques, data science, and other technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness in fast-growing markets. Although the EBW process can be monitored by characterisation of the electron beams before welding or using backscattered electron signals (BSE), the noise and lack of understanding of these signal patterns is a major obstacle to the development of a reliable, rapid and cost-effective process analysis and control methodology.In this thesis a controlled experiment was designed to be relevant to those industries and improve understanding of the relationship between beam and weld quality. The welding quality control starts before welding, continue throughout the welding process, and is completed with examination after welding. The same workflow was followed in this thesis, focusing on aforementioned QC stages, starting with beam probing experiments, followed by monitoring weld pool stability using high dynamic range camera and BSE signals, and ending with metallographic inspection on sections.The rapid development of computer vision methods brought an idea of classifying beam probing data before welding, which is first QC stage. Dataset of 3015 BeamAssure measurements was used in combination with deep learning, and various encoding methods such as Recurrence Plots (RP), Gramian Angular Fields (GAF), and Markov Transition Fields (MTF). The segmentation and classification results achieved a remarkable rate of 97.6% of accuracy in the classification task. This part of the work showed that use of time-series images enabled identification of the beam focus location before welding and providing recommended focus adjustment value.To replicate in-process QC step, titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) plates were welded with a gap opened in a stepwise manner, to simulate gap defects and introduce weld pool instability. Experiments were conducted to monitor the weld pool stability with a HDR camera and BSE detector designed for the need of this experiment. Signal and image analysis revealed occurrence of the weld defects and their locations, which was reflected by last QC stage, metallographic inspection on sections. This final part of the work proved that whatever method is used for gap defects monitoring, those joint misalignments can be easily registered by both methods. More interestingly, BSE monitoring allowed porosity and humping detection, which shapes and location were projected onto the BSE signal amplitude. Presented three stage QC method can contribute to a better understanding of beam probing and BSE signals patterns, providing a promising approach for quality assurance in EBW and could lead to higher weld integrity by improved process monitoring.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

There are many difficulties in finding alternative cheap, scalable, and environmentally friendly end-of-life routes for carpet, as it is a long-lasting, hard-wearing composite material. The aim of this project, working together with Carpet Recycling UK (CRUK), was to explore the feasibility of various end-of-life routes for carpet in the UK. A literature review was conducted, analysing a variety of different routes for waste carpets and the merits and drawbacks of each, concluding that concrete reinforcement, sound insulation, and oil absorption are the three most promising areas, along with the production method of melt/electrospinning. Experimental work has been conducted on the separation of carpet fibres from backing using sink-float separation, the quantifying of these components with FTIR and DSC analysis, and the production of 3D printing filament. The filament produced by this was not of sufficient quality for further testing, potentially due to thermal degradation and/or contamination, and the report suggests ways in which higher quality filament could be produced. CO2e calculations have been made for a variety of different disposal routes to provide novel information on the CO2e impact of carpet disposal. This section shows that concrete reinforcement, equestrian surfacing, reuse and recycling are the least CO2e intensive end-of-life routes (0.063 tCO2e/tonne of carpet waste). The section also considered the impact of including a projected carbon offset, which reduces the apparent impact of EFW, kiln fuel, and concrete reinforcement (from 2.401 tCO2e/tonne to 0.548, -0.138, and -0.377 tCO2e/tonne respectively). Finally, landfill appears in CO2¬¬e impact as effectively neutral in impact, showing it may be a promising option for sequestering carpet waste until recycling technology improves.

Disclosures of strategy and business model (SBM) are therefore considered a central element of effective annual report commentary (Guillaume, 2018; IIRC, 2011). By applying natural language processing techniques, I explore what SBM disclosures look like when managementare pressed to say something, analyse determinants of cross-sectional variation in SBM reporting properties, and assess whether and how managers respond to regulatory interventions seeking to promote SBM annual report commentary. This dissertation contains three main chapters. Chapter 2 presents a systematic review of the academic literature on non-financial reporting and the emerging literature on SBM reporting. Here, I also introduce my institutional setting. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 form the empirical sections of this thesis. In Chapter 3, I construct the first large sample corpus of SBM annual report commentary and provide the first systematic analysis of the properties of such disclosures. My topic modelling analysis rejects the hypothesis that such disclosure is merely padding; instead finding themes align with popular strategy frameworks and management tailor the mix of SBM topics to reflect their unique approach to value creation. However, SBM commentary is less specific, less preciseabout time horizon (short- and long-term), and less balanced (more positive) in tone relative to general management commentary. My findings suggest symbolic compliance and legitimisation characterize the typical annual report discussion of SBM. Further analysis identifies proprietary cost considerations and obfuscation incentives as key determinants of symbolic reporting. In Chapter 4, I seek evidence on how managers respond to regulatory mandates by adapting the properties of disclosure and investigate whether the form of the mandate matters. Using a differences-in-differences research design, my results suggest a modest incremental response by treatment firms to the introduction of a comply or explain provision to provide disclosure on strategy and business model. In contrast, I find a substantial response to enacting the same requirements in law. My analysis provides clear and consistentevidence that treatment firms incrementally increase the volume of SBM disclosure, improve coverage across a broad range of topics as well as providing commentary with greater focus on the long term. My results point to substantial changes in SBM reporting properties following regulatory mandates, but the form of the mandate does matter. Overall, this dissertation contributes to the accounting literature by examining how firms discuss a central topic toeconomic decision making in annual reports and how firms respond to different forms of disclosure mandate. Furthermore, the results of my analysis are likely to be of value for regulators and policymakers currently reviewing or considering mandating disclosure requirements. By examining how companies adapt their reporting to different types of regulations, this study provides an empirical basis for recalibrating SBM disclosure mandates, thereby enhancing the information set of capital market participants and promoting stakeholder engagement in a landscape increasingly shaped by non-financial information.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

It allows for the behaviour of random real-world systems to be analysed, evaluated, and optimised. It is critical to understand the uncertainty and error in outcomes from simulation experiments, to ensure that decisions are made with appropriate levels of confidence.Frequently, input models that actuate stochastic simulations are estimated usingsamples of real-world data. This introduces a source of uncertainty into the simulation model which propagates through to output measures, causing an error known as input uncertainty. Input uncertainty depends on the samples of data that are collected and used to estimate the input models for the simulation. In this thesis, we consider problems relating to input uncertainty and data collection in the field of stochastic simulation.Firstly, we propose an algorithm that guides the data collection procedure for asimulation experiment in a manner that minimises input uncertainty. Reducing the uncertainty around the simulation response allows for improved insights to be inferred from simulation results. Secondly, we outline an approach for comparing data collection strategies in terms of the input uncertainty passed to outputs in simulations of viral loads. This represents a different type of data collection problem to the ones usually studied in simulation experiments. Thirdly, we adapt two techniques for quantifying input uncertainty to consider a quantile of the simulation outputs, rather than the mean. Quantiles are regularly used to provide alternative information regarding the simulation outputs relative to the mean, therefore it is equally important to understand the uncertainty of such measures. Finally, we begin to investigate how input uncertainty impacts predictive models fit to simulation data. This relates to the field of simulationanalytics, a novel and emergent area of research where the problem of input uncertainty has not previously been examined.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

However, the availability of real-time data, data storage, and monitoring has become challenging. This research investigates a method based on Bi-directional LSTM (BDLSTM) neural network. BDLSTM takes into account the data's past and future context. The future hidden layer takes input in ascending order while the past hidden layer evaluates the input in decreasing order, making BDLSTM relevant in analyzing the input data's past context and evaluating future predictions. The eleven-year (2010–2020) weather dataset used for this paper was acquired from NASA. Two pre-processing approaches, Automatic Time Series Decomposition (ATSD) and Pearson correlation, were used to remove the noisy values from the residual components and for feature selection, respectively. To ensure storage and reuse of data, the architecture includes a cloud-based server for data management and reuse for future predictions. Popular in multi-energy systems, the cloud-based server also serves as a platform for monitoring predicted solar energy data. The metrics values and results obtained have demonstrated that the BDLSTM performs efficiently on the available data.

M.","31/12/2023","Fine spatial resolution remote sensing images are crucial sources of data for monitoring the Earth's surface. Due to defects in sensors and the complicated imaging environment, however, fine spatial resolution images always suffer from various degrees of information loss. According to the basic attributes of remote sensing images, the information loss generally falls into three dimensions, that is, the spatial, temporal and spectral dimensions. In recent decades, many methods have been developed to cope with this information loss problem in the three dimensions, which are termed spatial reconstruction, temporal reconstruction and spectral reconstruction in this paper. This paper presents a comprehensive review of all three types of reconstruction. First, a systematic introduction and review of the achievements is provided, including the refined general mathematical framework and diagram for each of the three parts. Second, the applications in various areas (e.g., meteorology, ecology and environmental science) are introduced. Third, the challenges and recent advances of spatial-temporal-spectral information reconstruction are summarized, such as the efforts for dealing with abrupt land cover changes in spatial reconstruction, inconsistency in multi-scale data acquired by different sensors in temporal reconstruction, and point spread function (PSF) effect in spectral reconstruction.

However, DGT results cannot yet be used directly in a regulatory framework to assess the chemical status of water bodies, as DGT labile concentrations cannot be directly compared to the metal AA-EQSmarine water (Annual Average Environmental Quality Standard) established by the WFD, which are defined in the dissolved concentration. Therefore, prior to using DGT results in a regulatory context, for cadmium, nickel and lead, an adaptation of existing AA-EQSmarine water for DGTs should be pursued, ensuring at least the same level of protection. In this sense, in the framework of the MONITOOL project, a robust database of dissolved and labile metal concentrations in transitional and coastal waters, for adapting the existing AA-EQSmarine water for DGT technique, was obtained. Building on these results, this study proposes a methodology and provides values and equations for using DGT results for the chemical status assessment of marine waters, by adapting the EQSmarine water to adapted EQSDGT or predicting dissolved concentrations from DGT results. Based on available dataset, a first simulation of “chemical status” assessment per MONITOOL sampling site using DGT measured labile concentrations was carried out and the results were compared to an assessment based on dissolved concentration to check their compliance. These results demonstrate that the use of DGT passive samplers is appropriate for the metal concentrations level encountered in the marine environment. Further work is recommended to test the effectiveness of the methodology proposed in this study under WFD conditions on more sites and to establish common strategy guidelines for the use of DGT passive samplers in monitoring.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

In addition, online adaptive technology is incorporated for real-time monitoring and separation of actuator failure information. The adaptive capability of the controller to parameter perturbation, disturbance, and fault deviation is therefore enhanced. Furthermore, the closed-loop system is featured by L2 gain stability/robustness against thrust output deviation, while the system trajectory is guaranteed to converge with user-defined settling time. Finally, numerical simulations on a microsatellite platform with redundant thrusters are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control approach.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

H 3 + ${\mathrm{H}}_{3}^{+}$ ions supercorotate near the dawn auroral oval and subcorotate across the dusk sector and in the dawn polar region relative to the planetary rotation rate, broadly in agreement with past observations and models. An anticyclonic vortex is discovered in H2 flows, closely matching the mean magnetospheric subcorotation when the observed magnetospheric flows are averaged azimuthally. In comparing ion and neutral winds, we measure the line‐of‐sight effective ion drift in the neutral reference frame for the first time, revealing two blue‐shifted sunward flows of ∼2 km/s. Observed H 3 + ${\mathrm{H}}_{3}^{+}$ and H2 emissions overlap with predictions of the Pedersen conductivity layer, suggesting two different regions of the ionosphere: (a) a deep layer, where neutral forces dominate the thermosphere and symmetric breakdown‐in‐corotation currents can close, and (b) a higher layer, where the observed effective ion drift allows dawn‐to‐dusk Pedersen currents within the upper atmosphere, in turn closing asymmetric currents within the magnetosphere. This ionospheric structure aligns well with recent Juno observations of Jupiter's aurora. The detected thermospheric vortex implies the driving of neutral flows by the momentum from the magnetosphere within the thermosphere and deeper in the atmosphere to potentially 20 mbar. Jovian neutral thermosphere might bridge the gap between current observations and modelings and perhaps be significant to the dynamics of aurora on Earth and other outer planets.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

L.","31/12/2023","Around the world today, universities are expected to play a unique role as creators of regional growth and innovation. While there appears to be a consensus that the role of universities has been expanded, critiques show that the contribution of universities to their regions is still not well defined. There have been some developments in the literature on the concept of modern universities such as the triple helix, entrepreneurial university and engaged university. However, those concepts focus on enforcing universities’ roles in a single domain such as entrepreneurship, innovation, or civic engagement. Little is known about how universities can facilitate regional growth that goes beyond knowledge transfer activities such as spin-off creation, licensing, and patenting. This paper contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of universities’ role in regional growth through the theoretical lens of ambidexterity. Using ambidexterity, universities with a regional focus were distinguished from those engaged in research commercialization and traditional third-mission roles. Through two case studies, this study found that teaching, research, and engagement should not be separated, since they can serve both economic and social missions. As a result, a new model of multidextrous universities is proposed where universities meet both economic and social missions through teaching, research, and engagement. Contrary to previous contributions which presented universities as ambidextrous organizations where tension appears only between research commercialization and research publication or between teaching and research, this study suggests that universities need to overcome tensions and incorporate a sense of place in all activities to successfully contribute to regional growth.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Methods: Data comprise 214 340 survey responses (quantitative ratings and free-text comments) dated 2015–2018. The proportions of patients giving each quantitative rating (0–10) are compared and free-text comments are analysed using computer-assisted linguistic methods in order to ascertain frequent thematic drivers of positive and negative feedback. Results: Patients were most likely to give a most positive score of 10 (38.25%), while the overwhelming majority (87.12%) gave a score between 8 and 10. Analysis of 1000 positive comments found that most respondents (54%) praised staff’s interpersonal skills. Other frequent themes of positive feedback included treatment standards, staff’s communication skills, speed of diagnosis and treatment, and staff members’ technical competence. The most prominent themes in the negative comments were communication skills, treatment standards and waiting times for appointments and test/scan results, and delays and cancellations to appointments and operations. Conclusion: Standards of treatment and staff’s communication skills are prominent themes of positive and negative feedback. Staff’s interpersonal skills are more likely to be praised than criticised, while negative feedback is more likely to focus on issues around time (ie, delays and long waits). Clarity and honesty in communication about the lengths and causes of waits and delays are likely to increase patient satisfaction.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Eliminating the polymeric supports allows the heterostructures to be fabricated in harsher environmental conditions (incompatible with a polymer) such as at temperatures of up to 600 °C, in organic solvents and in ultra-high vacuum. The resulting heterostructures have high-quality interfaces without interlayer contamination and exhibit strong electronic and optoelectronic behaviour. We use the technique to assemble twisted-graphene heterostructures in ultra-high vacuum, resulting in a tenfold improvement in moiré superlattice homogeneity compared to conventional transfer techniques.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

The increased number of MCPS generates a massive amount of privacy-sensitive data, hence it is important to enhance the security of devices and data transmission in MCPS. Earlier several research studies were undertaken in order to enhance security in healthcare, but none of them could adapt to changing behaviors of data attacks. Here the role of blockchain and Reinforcement Learning (RL) comes into play since it can adjust itself to the nature of changing attacks, thus preventing any kind of attacks. This work proposes a solution, named Cogni-Sec, which employs a decentralized cognitive blockchain and Reinforcement Learning architecture and addresses the security issue. Blockchain is incorporated in the approach for data storage and transmission to increase the degree of security in the MCPS modules. Hyperledger Fabric is applied as the blockchain base which shows transaction query results with nearly 10% increased throughput, 69% less memory consumption, and 15% lower CPU usage when compared to Ethereum. Further security risk at the block mining level within a blockchain network is reduced by introducing distributed Reinforcement Learning architecture in replacement for the miner nodes, which imitates the cognitive behavior of miners in a distributed environment. Different multi-agent learning systems have been evaluated for building the mining agent. Among these, the a3c agent in distributed learning setup yields the optimum cumulative reward with a median value of 54.5 and minimizes the maximum number of data threats.","Tech","University of Lancaster"

Both measurements and model show distinct hemispheric gradients with the mean measured Northern to Southern Hemisphere (NH/SH) ratio of 2 or greater for all four Cl-VSLS. In addition, the TOGA profiles over the NH mid-latitudes showed general enhancements in the Pacific basin compared to the Atlantic basin, with up to ?18 ppt difference for CH2Cl2 in the mid troposphere. We tagged regional source emissions of CH2Cl2 and C2Cl4 in the model and found that Asian emissions dominate the global distributions of these species both at the surface (950 hPa) and at high altitudes (150 hPa). Overall, our results confirm relatively high mixing ratios of Cl-VSLS in the UTLS region and show that the CESM model does a reasonable job of simulating their global abundance but we also note the uncertainties with Cl-VSLS emissions and active chlorine sources in the model. These findings will be used to validate future emission inventories and to investigate the fast convective transport of Cl-VSLS to the UTLS region and their impact on stratospheric ozone.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

However, the introduction of O or H O during the gas-phase sulfation increases the molar ratios of Ce /(Ce + Ce ) and O /(O + O + O ) on the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst surface, thus promoting the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and chemisorbed oxygen, and these properties of the catalyst are further enhanced by the co-existence of O and H O. Furthermore, the reduction of sulfates formed under the action of O or H O decreases the weak acid sites of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst, but the few and highly dispersive sulfates present stronger reducibility, and the proportion of medium-strong acid sites of the catalyst increases. These factors help to improve the NH -SCR activity of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst. Thus, there exists a synergistic effect of H O and O introduction during gas-phase sulfation on the physical-chemical properties and catalytic performance of the sulfated CeO -OS catalyst by organic COS + CS at 50 °C.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

C.","15/01/2024","The occurrence of plastic waste in the environment is an emerging and ongoing concern. In addition to the physical impacts of macroplastics and microplastics on organisms, the chemical effects of plastic additives such as plasticisers have also received increasing attention. Research concerning plasticiser pollution in estuaries and coastal environments has been a particular focus, as these environments are the primary entry point for anthropogenic contaminants into the wider marine environment. Additionally, the conditions in estuarine environments favour the sedimentation of suspended particulate matter, with which plasticisers are strongly associated. Hence, estuary systems may be where some of the highest concentrations of these pollutants are seen in freshwater and marine environments. Recent studies have confirmed emerging plasticisers and phthalates as pollutants in estuaries, with the relative abundance of these compounds controlled primarily by patterns of use, source intensity, and fate. Plasticiser profiles are typically dominated by mid-high molecular weight compounds such as DnBP, DiBP, and DEHP. Plasticisers may be taken up by estuarine and marine organisms, and some phthalates can cause negative impacts in marine organisms, although further research is required to assess the impacts of emerging plasticisers. This review provides an overview of the processes controlling the release and partitioning of emerging and legacy plasticisers in aqueous environments, in addition to the sources of plasticisers in estuarine and coastal environments. This is followed by a quantitative analysis and discussion of literature concerning the (co-)occurrence and concentrations of emerging plasticisers and phthalates in these environments. We end this review with a discussion the fate (degradation and uptake by biota) of these compounds, in addition to identification of knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research.

However, an alternate strategy is needed to address both water and energy shortages in parallel. Additionally, the disposal of desalination brine necessitates specific consideration while designing a sustainable solar interfacial desalination system. Herein, we demonstrate a single system that utilizes incident solar irradiance to produce interfacial steam using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated cotton fabric (CF) to desalinate seawater with an evaporation efficiency of 86.98%. The high thermal conductivity and excellent optical absorption of rGO contribute to the absorption of a broad solar spectrum. The system also produces 339.26 mW of electricity simultaneously by deploying commercially available thermoelectric generator (TEG) modules that use the squandered heat, increasing the overall system efficiency by 7.3%. The use of a custom-made power electronics module ensures operating at the maximum power point which has also been verified by computer simulation. Finally, hydrogen gas with zero carbon emission is produced by electrolyzing the seawater utilizing the electricity generated by the TEG module using solar-induced heat at a rate of 0.52 mmol h               −1. Converting brine into hydrogen and oxygen gas by electrolysis demonstrates a potential in situ approach for desalination waste remediation.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Richardson’s encounters with these fish sheds light on different aspects of his career as a naval surgeon, polar explorer, and natural historian. More importantly, though, these encounters also reveal how European knowledge of the world’s coastal environments was created during the Romantic era. In considering the context and consequences of these encounters, this essay reflects on how the subject of this special issue, though nationally defined, connects with broader histories of nineteenth-century exploration and empire. The places where these fish were caught lay well beyond Scotland. Nonetheless, these fish are relevant to the study of Scotland’s Coastal Romanticisms, and tracing their history invites us to rethink the geographical assumptions that often govern the study of national pasts","Marine","University of Lancaster"

There are many difficulties in finding alternative cheap, scalable, and environmentally friendly end-of-life routes for carpet, as it is a long-lasting, hard-wearing composite material. The aim of this project, working together with Carpet Recycling UK (CRUK), was to explore the feasibility of various end-of-life routes for carpet in the UK. A literature review was conducted, analysing a variety of different routes for waste carpets and the merits and drawbacks of each, concluding that concrete reinforcement, sound insulation, and oil absorption are the three most promising areas, along with the production method of melt/electrospinning. Experimental work has been conducted on the separation of carpet fibres from backing using sink-float separation, the quantifying of these components with FTIR and DSC analysis, and the production of 3D printing filament. The filament produced by this was not of sufficient quality for further testing, potentially due to thermal degradation and/or contamination, and the report suggests ways in which higher quality filament could be produced. CO2e calculations have been made for a variety of different disposal routes to provide novel information on the CO2e impact of carpet disposal. This section shows that concrete reinforcement, equestrian surfacing, reuse and recycling are the least CO2e intensive end-of-life routes (0.063 tCO2e/tonne of carpet waste). The section also considered the impact of including a projected carbon offset, which reduces the apparent impact of EFW, kiln fuel, and concrete reinforcement (from 2.401 tCO2e/tonne to 0.548, -0.138, and -0.377 tCO2e/tonne respectively). Finally, landfill appears in CO2¬¬e impact as effectively neutral in impact, showing it may be a promising option for sequestering carpet waste until recycling technology improves.

It acknowledged their key role in developing transferable skills in the students and filled a knowledge gap as very little literature highlighted their perspectives.An intervention of co-creating work-based learning outcomes for transferable skills was thought to be psychologically wise (Walton & Wilson, 2018) in addressing gaps in the constructive alignment of work-based learning from a pilot study (Ong, 2022) as a first step in a coaching process (Gettman, 2019).While a protocol for the co-creation process was suggested, the unique circumstances that surrounded each participant resulted in slight variations that made a case study approach more suitable for qualitative data analysis. The concepts of “clarity” and “gifts” were starting points for thematic analysis.“Clarity” was found to be evident from the supervisors’ perspective of being clearer of the process from learning outcomes to assessment (constructive alignment) and their role as coaches to be less directive and more collaborative in the process. While coaching was challenging to the supervisors, the satisfaction of observing growth in the student was a “gift” in itself.Coaching required a mindset change in the supervisors to listen more to the student voice, and for the student to value learning more than grades. This could be difficult in the context of fast-paced Singapore where the tension between putting effort to develop transferable skills in students and getting work done. As such, the tripartite relationship (Feldmann, 2016) between the work supervisor, academic supervisor and student would have to be a close one for the long-term development of the students’ transferable skills to be realised.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

However, DGT results cannot yet be used directly in a regulatory framework to assess the chemical status of water bodies, as DGT labile concentrations cannot be directly compared to the metal AA-EQSmarine water (Annual Average Environmental Quality Standard) established by the WFD, which are defined in the dissolved concentration. Therefore, prior to using DGT results in a regulatory context, for cadmium, nickel and lead, an adaptation of existing AA-EQSmarine water for DGTs should be pursued, ensuring at least the same level of protection. In this sense, in the framework of the MONITOOL project, a robust database of dissolved and labile metal concentrations in transitional and coastal waters, for adapting the existing AA-EQSmarine water for DGT technique, was obtained. Building on these results, this study proposes a methodology and provides values and equations for using DGT results for the chemical status assessment of marine waters, by adapting the EQSmarine water to adapted EQSDGT or predicting dissolved concentrations from DGT results. Based on available dataset, a first simulation of “chemical status” assessment per MONITOOL sampling site using DGT measured labile concentrations was carried out and the results were compared to an assessment based on dissolved concentration to check their compliance. These results demonstrate that the use of DGT passive samplers is appropriate for the metal concentrations level encountered in the marine environment. Further work is recommended to test the effectiveness of the methodology proposed in this study under WFD conditions on more sites and to establish common strategy guidelines for the use of DGT passive samplers in monitoring.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

The results demonstrate that the introduction of 0.33 vol% H2O is beneficial to enhance the interaction between organic CS2+COS and cube fluorite CeO2, which not only increases the concentrations of Ce3+ ions, chemisorbed oxygen (Oβ) and oxygen vacancies on CeO2-CS2+COS surface, but also effectively enhances the redox cycle of Ce4+/Ce3+ ion pairs and the medium-strong acid sites of catalyst. These all help enhance the promotional effect of organic sulfur low-temperature gas-phase sulfation on the NH3-SCR activity of CeO2 and further improve NOx reduction over the CeO2-CS2+COS catalyst. However, the introduction of 5.0 vol% H2O shows a certain inhibitory effect due to the competitive adsorption of excess water and CS2+COS on the cube fluorite CeO2 surface, which weakens their interaction during the low-temperature gas-phase sulfation, thereby decreases the promotional effect of low concentration water introduction on the NH3-SCR activity of the CeO2-CS2+COS catalyst.

IoTs unify hardware (embedded sensors), software (algorithms to manipulate sensors), and wireless network (protocols that transmit sensor data) to develop and operationalize a wide range of smart systems and services. The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs for short) is a specific genre of IoTs in which data about ocean ecosystems is continuously ingested via underwater sensors. IoUTs referred to as context-sensing eyes and ears under the sea operationalize a diverse range of scenarios ranging from exploring marine life to analyzing water pollution and mining oceanic data. This paper proposes a layered architecture that (i) ingests oceanic data as a sensing layer, (ii) computes the correlation between the data as an analytics layer, and (iii) visualizes data for human decision support via the interface layer. We unify the concepts of software engineering (SE) and IoTs to exploit software architecture, underlying algorithms, and tool support to develop and operationalize IoUTs. A case study-based approach is used to demonstrate the sensors’ throughput, query response time, and algorithmic execution efficiency. We collected IoUT sensor data, involving 6 distinct sensors from two locations including the Arabian Sea, and the Red Sea for 60 days. Evaluation results indicate (i) sensors’ throughput (daily average: 10000–20000 KB data transmission), (ii) query response time (under 30 ms), (iii) and query execution performance (CPU utilization between 60%–80%).

The influence of SNS treatment and water-to-cement (w/c) ratio on the performance of the cementitious composites was elucidated. The experimental results showed that 0.2- wt% and 0.35 were the optimal SNS concentration and w/c ratio for increasing the compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength, flexural modulus, fracture energy and fracture toughness. These properties were enhanced by as much as 12.15%, 36.87%, 39.91%, 32.69%, 69.01% and 49.06%, respectively. This enhancement was due to crack deflection and crack bridging mechanisms in the cementitious composites as a result of the high specific surface area of SNS and the strong chemical and physical bonding of SNS with the hydration phases. The SNS materials offers strong advantages over graphene-based materials on improving the engineering properties of cementitious materials and reducing their cost and CO2 emissions.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

As global food systems come under increasing pressure from the future impacts of climate change and other global crises, the need to provide a stable, readily available supply of healthy, nutritious produce is increasingly important. Whilst plasticulture is considered an effective measure to maintain food security and increase agricultural productivity, there is a global call to reduce plastic use in agriculture. The impact of plastics from ‘cradle-to-grave’ are overwhelmingly negative, thought to compromise long-term agricultural productivity, human and planetary health. Even though there is an urgent call to reduce plastic use in agriculture, we are not equipped with an adequate knowledge base to assess and reevaluate plasticulture. Our understanding of plasticulture and its importance in food systems has not yet been comprehensively assessed. In parallel, the implications of plastic use in agricultural systems are not fully understood, in particular the quantification of microplastics in agricultural soils and risks to future agroecosystem functioning. This thesis presents a review of the UK food system and a meta-analysis to explore the relative importance of plasticulture. The meta-analysis found that plasticulture is key to increasing the yield of globally-important crops in agricultural systems worldwide. This is followed by a nationwide survey, soil archive analysis and a mesocosm experiment that investigate microplastic concentrations, fate and impacts in agricultural soils. The nationwide survey suggests that plastic crop covers are a significant contributor of microplastics to agricultural soils. Analysis of the Rothamsted soil archive revealed that agricultural soils are receptors of microplastic pollution from different agricultural sources and non-agricultural sources which predate modern plasticulture. A mesocosm experiment was used to determine the effects of microplastics on soil and crop health, as well as the influence of soil and crop type on microplastic transport. The results from the mesocosm experiment indicate microplastics pollution affects agroecosystem functioning. This thesis is an essential contribution to producing a comprehensive assessment of plastic use in agriculture in future food systems. The findings from this thesis highlight an urgent need to reassess plastic use in agriculture. Sustainable plasticulture will be vital to build the resilience of a future food system that prioritises human and planetary health.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

I sought to address the problematic nature of the prevailing skills-focused employability concept within universities by advocating for a more holistic concept that could be used by academics to foster critical thinking, global citizenship, creativity and connectedness among students, thus contributing to the mitigation of issues arising from the commodification of skills. To guide the research, I adopted a pragmatist standpoint and crafted a conceptual framework embodying two key concepts: relational higher education and Lacković’s (2019) relational graduate employability paradigm. The research objectives were to develop and test the new framework in units of study during one semester, collect and analyse data to assess the framework’s practical application and value for academics and students, and establish a basis for ongoing evaluation. By introducing the new concept of ‘relational employability’ to ECU academics and students, I aimed to expand their thoughts and actions regarding employability from solely individuals’ employment-related skills and outcomes to including relationships with others (humans, species, environments, artefacts, technologies, etc.) throughout careers (life and work). I employed a design research methodological framework that incorporated various data collection and analytical techniques across three phases: preparation and design; implementation over one semester; and analysis and sharing of practice. During the preparation and design phase, I completed two literature reviews (one of these is published), designed a prototype relational employability framework, and conducted pre-implementation qualitative interviews with 22 participants, including ECU academics, employability experts, careers practitioners and a senior learning designer. Codebook thematic analysis of the interview data provided insights into the meaning and value of relational employability among participants and enabled refinement of the framework.During the implementation phase, I collaborated with four academics from Medical and Health Sciences and Nursing disciplines to integrate the framework into five units, spanning undergraduate to postgraduate levels. After implementation, I administered student questionnaires and conducted qualitative interviews with three academics and three students to gain insights into their experiences and perspectives of the new framework and relational employability concept in existing teaching-learning and assessment. I also examined institutional unit level data to ensure there were no ill effects of the study on student outcomes and experiences and to establish baseline data to inform ongoing implementation and evaluation of the framework at ECU.The study revealed the benefits and some challenges of incorporating the framework into units of study. There were largely positive effects on student success and satisfaction, with the framework serving as a catalyst for holistic employability development and wider considerations of the implications of personal and collective interactions and contributions throughout careers. Academics discovered that integrating relational employability into existing teaching-learning and assessment was feasible and could enhance the meaningfulness of employability for students if they, themselves, understood the relational framework and could associate it with their discipline. The findings also suggested that the framework could assist academics to establish connections between technological considerations and the concept of employability. Questionnaire results revealed students felt the framework positively impacted their development, including confidence and self-esteem. Both academics and students shared a view that the framework should be integrated across the entire degree program, starting from first year and continuing through to graduation. The outputs of this research included a SharePoint site for staff that provides educational resources to support the adoption of relational employability within ECU. More broadly, the study offers 16 practical recommendations for educators and universities to incorporate relational employability principles into their educational practice.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

The SMS material was added to cement pastes in different concentrations and the hydration kinetics of the cementitious composites were studied via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The effect of SMS on the hydration development of cement, change in the pore size distribution and microstructural evolution were also quantified. The CV and EIS results revealed that the synergetic effect of the reactive SMS surface functional groups and tricalcium silicate (C3S) increased the ionic strength of the pore solution, ion diffusion rate and charge transport properties within the cementitious pastes. The CV and EIS measurements correlated well with the two main indicators of the cement hydration rate: the degree of hydration (DOH) and the calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) content. The delineated hydration kinetics suggested that the SMS sheets accelerate the dissolution of C3S and increase the hydration depth by channelling water from the pore solution to the unhydrated cement core thereby amplifying the growth of the hydration phases.

The elaborated expression is intended to avoid use of the classical approach of sorption which relies on experimental data and empirical models. The goal is to produce an expression that provides a distribution coefficient (Kd e.g. mL g-1) as function of pH, E and ligand concentration (through complex formation in solution) by applying a surface complexation model on one type of mono-dentate surface sites >(SuOH) as well as utilizing multi-dentate surface sites >(SuOH)c. The formulation of the worked out expression makes use of correlations between the surface complexation and hydrolysis constants for all species and sorption sites. The model was applied to the sorption of uranium onto bioorganic sites with and without carbonates in solution e.g. Log Kd: +2.75 at pH 8 for 2 sites per nm2. The calculated distribution coefficients were found very sensitive to the presence of carbonates, e.g. Log Kd: -7.0 at pH 8 for 2×10-3 M total carbonate. The potential reduction of uranium U(VI) and its complexes (carbonates) which are the primary stable species in surface waters, to U(IV) during sorption was simulated in association with a decrease in the redox potential and was found generally below the redox stability limits of water. The calculated distribution coefficient values were validated by the values reported in literature for the sorption of uranium onto specific adsorbents. The investigated simulations are also applicable to the sorption of other redox sensitive elements.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

However, in reality, out-of-distribution (OOD) cases such as new fault conditions can happen after the original trained model is deployed. Most of the current DNNs are deterministic which can misclassify with high confidence in the open-world scenario. This overconfident behavior would not guarantee the reliability and robustness of fault diagnosis results in practice. Therefore, trustworthy intelligent fault diagnosis with uncertainty estimation is crucial for real applications. In this paper, we develop a novel convolutional neural network integrating evidence theory to achieve fault classifications with prediction uncertainty estimation. The estimated prediction uncertainty can identify potential OOD samples. This approach allows a minimal modification of the state-of-the-art DNN model by using a risk-calibrated evidential loss function and Dirichlet distribution that replaces the classification probabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only achieve accurate classification of known classes but also detect unknown classes effectively. The proposed method shows significant potential in detecting OOD patterns and provides trustworthy fault diagnosis in open and non-stationary environments.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Between November 2018 and December 2019 ice speed increased by 94 ± 4% (1.47 ± 0.6 km/yr), ice discharge increased by 0.52 ± 0.21 Gt/yr, and the calving front retreated by 8 km with dynamic thinning on grounded ice of 20.1 ± 2.6 m/yr. This change was concurrent with a positive temperature anomaly in the upper ocean, where a 400 m deep channel allowed warm water to reach Cadman Glacier driving the dynamic activation, while neighbouring Funk and Lever Glaciers were protected by bathymetric sills across their fjords. Our results show that forcing by warm ocean water can cause the rapid onset of dynamic imbalance and increased ice discharge from glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula, highlighting the region’s sensitivity to future climate variability.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Contemporary views about darkness are complex and contradictory, despite the global onslaught of over-illumination and the malign social, health, environmental, and aesthetic effects this continues to perpetrate. Dark sky places, as we argue, are invariably situated and relational, and existing limited perspectives negate and ignore the far more subtle and important relationships that span histories, communities, cultural practices, sensory experiences, and creative engagements. By reframing the concepts and meanings associated with dark skies, we establish a more holistic yet variegated account of our relationships with the dark.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Sustainability/SDG management tools and frameworks have been previously developed with features to enhance business’ understanding of SDGs, to assist them in prioritising SDGs, to act as a monitoring tool, thereby supporting companies to engage and align with the SDGs. However, SMEs stillface difficulties in employing these tools due to issues such as business awareness, tool’s suitability, ill-translated SDGs, limited resources, as well as a lack of external motivators. The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers faced by food and drink SMEs to engage with the SDG framework, as well as producing recommendations on the indicators and features for the development of an SDG management tool (INTOTO by SDG Changemakers). This is done through combining secondary and primary data collection on the barriers and SDG management tools, as well as investigating the methods to develop anindicator framework supporting the design of an SDG management tool. For the field research, a single case study was adopted with 4 semi-structured interviews, non-participant observation, along with access to relevant information at the case study company. This research identified three levels of the barriers faced by food and drink SMEs to engage with the SDG framework, including barriers to sustainable practices, barriers to the SDG framework, as well as barriers to utilising SDG management tools. In addition, 56 indicatorsand 14 sustainability topics are proposed for the indicator framework, under the concept and structure of the triple bottom line. It is important to comprehensively understand the full range of barriers so that the developed SDG management tool can effectively assist food and drink SMEs to align with the SDGs.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Despite the absence of consistent microfossil first occurrence markers for the recognition of the base of the Brigantian, this horizon can be confidently recognised by means of foraminiferal trends. The FTs allow the precise location of the base of the correlated Brigantian in sections where this boundary was questioned or controversial in previous studies, as well as to amend the position of the foraminiferal zones and subzones during the late Asbian and basal Brigantian. This type of analysis when used in combination with foraminiferal zonations, emergent surfaces and lithological cyclicity, together, provide a robust means for high-resolution correlation.

"Nothing lasts forever: Dominant species decline under rapid environmental change in global grasslands","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/nothing-lasts-forever(24707367-166c-4e73-b8fe-125b1caa8271).html","Stevens, C. J.","1/11/2023","Dominance often indicates one or a few species being best suited for resource capture and retention in a given environment. Press perturbations that change availability of limiting resources can restructure competitive hierarchies, allowing new species to capture or retain resources and leaving once dominant species fated to decline. However, dominant species may maintain high abundances even when their new environments no longer favour them due to stochastic processes associated with their high abundance, impeding deterministic processes that would otherwise diminish them. Here, we quantify the persistence of dominance by tracking the rate of decline in dominant species at 90 globally distributed grassland sites under experimentally elevated soil nutrient supply and reduced vertebrate consumer pressure. We found that chronic experimental nutrient addition and vertebrate exclusion caused certain subsets of species to lose dominance more quickly than in control plots. In control plots, perennial species and species with high initial cover maintained dominance for longer than annual species and those with low initial cover respectively. In fertilized plots, species with high initial cover maintained dominance at similar rates to control plots, while those with lower initial cover lost dominance even faster than similar species in controls. High initial cover increased the estimated time to dominance loss more strongly in plots with vertebrate exclosures than in controls. Vertebrate exclosures caused a slight decrease in the persistence of dominance for perennials, while fertilization brought perennials' rate of dominance loss in line with those of annuals. Annual species lost dominance at similar rates regardless of treatments. Synthesis. Collectively, these results point to a strong role of a species' historical abundance in maintaining dominance following environmental perturbations. Because dominant species play an outsized role in driving ecosystem processes, their ability to remain dominant—regardless of environmental conditions—is critical to anticipating expected rates of change in the structure and function of grasslands. Species that maintain dominance while no longer competitively favoured following press perturbations due to their historical abundances may result in community compositions that do not maximize resource capture, a key process of system responses to global change.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

M. P.","31/10/2023","Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods are being increasingly used in proof-of-concept studies to detect shark species, many populations of which are experiencing severe declines. These methods are widely seen as the future of biodiversity monitoring, but they have yet to become established as routine monitoring techniques for elasmobranch species. Here, we developed species-specific quantitative PCR assays for the detection of grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and silvertip shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus). We assessed whether species-specific eDNA methods could infer the distribution of the two species around the atolls of the Chagos Archipelago, which, despite being surrounded by a large marine protected area, experience contrasting levels of illegal fishing leading to heterogeneity in shark population densities. We found that eDNA detections were significantly reduced and sporadic around the northern atolls, which are under high pressure from illegal fishing. By contrast eDNA detections of both species were ubiquitous and consistent around the highly protected atoll Diego Garcia. We postulate that current levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is having a significant impact on the shark community in the northern atolls and suppressing local reef shark populations. In the northern atolls we also employed visual and acoustic telemetry techniques to reveal the distribution of reef sharks. We found that despite eDNA samples being taken directly after visual surveys, detection results did not correlate, suggesting a need for further optimisation of eDNA methods for detecting sharks. However, both species were detected by eDNA in sites where they were not observed, highlighting that the scale of the sampling environment must be considered when inferring eDNA results and showing that eDNA methods can be used to fill gaps in data from more established monitoring techniques. We conclude that eDNA methods should be used in combination with other techniques to provide a complete picture of shark distribution so that threatened species can be better protected.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

This effect persists even when controlling for the quantity of works purchased, suggesting that more than just higher activity was at play. The paper builds upon previous empirical work showing that art dealers use their network connections to obtain less noisy signals about artworks’ value, resulting in a competitive edge in the market.

Many of the key processes centered around P solubilisation in the rhizosphere govern both plant uptake or potential leaching. However, the processes of controlling P solubilisation in the rhizosphere are of varying efficiency and now subject to constant changes under the varying soil conditions due to the climate change. In turn it is thought to have a potential onward effect of drying and rewetting (DRW) on the rhizosphere, which is one of the central components of this thesis. Thus, the focus of this PhD is to assess the P solubilisation processes in the rhizosphere with respect to the immediate (i-DRW) and delayed (d-DRW) DRW effect.Alongside this, the thesis is also focussed in assessing the behaviour of different types of phosphate fertiliser and their potential efficiency in the rhizosphere, particularly widely available new low-grade phosphate rock (PR) for potential crop benefit. The low-grade PR material is newly emerging into the market and can be used as a potentially more sustainable type of P fertiliser over time, as a substitute higher-grade PR. The overarching hypothesis tested was “P solubilisation in the rhizosphere can be affected by climate driven changes of soil associated with immediate and delayed effects of DRW events and root-zone acidification, under variable P amendments, with a particular consideration of the effects of low-grade phosphate rock”. To approach this, eight sub-hypotheses were tested, each being part of four different controlled experiments in the greenhouse using soils from four distinct agricultural regions of China. All laboratory experiments of P solubilisation (and potential leaching) in the rhizosphere were undertaken in three steps, which were dealt with chapters 3, 4 and 5. Overall, the key findings indicate that the P solubilisation in the rhizosphere (with corresponding plant productivity) is highly dependent on soil type, in particular the biological and hydrological characteristics. The results show substantially different levels of soil P solubilisation, related to exudative processes of the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere manipulation by inducing soil acidity via chemicals and legumes, had significant effects on soil P solubilsation and plant growth response (chapter 3). The P solubilisation processes also performed better on the soil with recent history of a series of DRW events, than soil with constant moisture treatment (chapter 5). This data supports the practical implications in the crop productivity over arid agricultural regions, especially with soils having low P availability used in these experiments. However, despite the assumptions of an increase in P solubilisation associated with i-DRW, the results of parallel study (chapter 4) did not prove to have a statistically significant difference across all treatments when soils were treated with frequent DRW events immediately. With regards DRW induced P leaching, the concentration of all P forms in leachate water varied in each cycle against soil type and the amount of P leaching following DRW was also proportionate with the rate of new P application. Concentration of P in the leachates of soils receiving different P sources varied from one i-DRW cycle to another, in respect of frequency and rate of DRW. Taken together, the evidence from the thesis led to the acceptance of the overarching hypothesis of this study. ","Marine","University of Lancaster"

A.","19/10/2023","The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is losing mass as the climate warms through both increased meltwater runoff and ice discharge at marine-terminating sectors. At the ice sheet surface, meltwater runoff forms a dynamic supraglacial hydrological system which includes stream and river networks and large supraglacial lakes (SGLs). Streams and rivers can route water into crevasses or into supraglacial lakes with crevasses underneath, both of which can then hydrofracture to the ice sheet base, providing a mechanism for the surface meltwater to access the bed. Understanding where, when, and how much meltwater is transferred to the bed is important because variability in meltwater supply to the bed can increase ice flow speeds, potentially impacting the hypsometry of the ice sheet in grounded sectors, and iceberg discharge to the ocean. Here we present a new, physically based, supraglacial hydrology model for the GrIS that is able to simulate (a) surface meltwater routing and SGL filling; (b) rapid meltwater drainage to the ice sheet bed via the hydrofracture of surface crevasses both in and outside of SGLs; (c) slow SGL drainage via overflow in supraglacial meltwater channels; and, by offline coupling with a second model, (d) the freezing and unfreezing of SGLs from autumn to spring. We call the model the Supraglacial Hydrology Evolution and Drainage (or SHED) model. We apply the model to three study regions in southwest Greenland between 2015 and 2019 (inclusive) and evaluate its performance with respect to observed supraglacial lake extents and proglacial discharge measurements. We show that the model reproduces 80 % of observed lake locations and provides good agreement with observations in terms of the temporal evolution of lake extent. Modelled moulin density values are in keeping with those previously published, and seasonal and inter-annual variability in proglacial discharge agrees well with that which is observed, though the observations lag the model by a few days since they include transit time through the subglacial system, while the model does not. Our simulations suggest that lake drainage behaviours may be more complex than traditional models suggest, with lakes in our model draining through a combination of both overflow and hydrofracture and with some lakes draining only partially and then refreezing. This suggests that, in order to simulate the evolution of Greenland's surface hydrological system with fidelity, a model that includes all of these processes needs to be used. In future work, we will couple our model to a subglacial model and an ice flow model and thus use our estimates of where, when, and how much meltwater gets to the bed to understand the consequences for ice flow.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Yet, this knowledge is of crucial importance in times of climate change and biodiversity loss.

The relationships between plant diversity and soil carbon as well as plant diversity and soil organic matter quality (carbon-to-nitrogen ratio) are particularly strong in warm and arid climates. While plant biomass is positively correlated with soil carbon, plant biomass is not significantly correlated with plant diversity. Our results indicate that plant diversity influences soil carbon storage not via the quantity of organic matter (plant biomass) inputs to soil, but through the quality of organic matter. The study implies that ecosystem management that restores plant diversity likely enhances soil carbon sequestration, particularly in warm and arid climates.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Operational pH, temperature, feeding rate, inoculum-to-substrate ratio, and hydrogen partial pressure and its liquid-to-gas mass transfer rate are the factors that govern the performance of the DF process. Sufficient research has been made that can lead to upscaling the DF process into an industrial-scale technology. However, the DF process cannot be upscaled at the current technology readiness level as a stand-alone technology. Hence, it requires a downstream process (preferably anaerobic digestion) to improve energy recovery efficiency and economic viability.

Further, the attachment and growth of HUVECs seeded on WPI-based hydrogels with different concentrations of WPI (15%, 20%, 30%, 40%) were investigated. Results: Supplementation with WPI did not affect the viability or proliferation of HUVECs monitored with real-time cell analysis. At the highest used concentration of WPI (500 µg/mL), a slight induction of ROS production in HUVECs was detected as compared with control samples, but it was not accompanied by alterations in cellular thiol levels. Regarding WPI-based hydrogels, HUVEC adhered and spread on all samples, showing good metabolic activity. Notably, cell number was highest on samples containing 20% and 30% WPI. Conclusions: The demonstration of the good compatibility of WPI hydrogels with endothelial cells in these experiments is an important step towards promoting the vascularization of hydrogels upon implantation in vivo, which is expected to improve implant outcomes in the future.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

In this study, a new rubberized ultra-lightweight high ductility cement composite (RULHDCC) was developed by mixing waste rubber particles and polyethylene (PE) fiber into an ultra-lightweight cement composite (ULCC). Previous studies have demonstrated that the effect of rubber and PE fiber results in satisfying static and dynamic compression performance. This study carried out a series of Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) splitting tests to investigate the impact of rubber and fiber on the tensile strength and splitting behavior of RULHDCC. The results showed that the splitting behavior of RULHDCC was significantly improved due to the synergistic effect of rubber and fiber, without much loss of compressive strength. The tension-Dynamic Increasing Factor (DIF) models are evaluated, and the limitations of the research are highlighted.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

P. W.; Maire, E.; Hamilton, M.; Hicks, C. C.; Graham, N. A. J.","4/10/2023","Coral reef fisheries supply nutritious catch to tropical coastal communities, where the quality of reef seafood is determined by both the rate of biomass production and nutritional value of reef fishes. Yet our understanding of reef fisheries typically uses targets of total reef fish biomass rather than individual growth (i.e. biomass production) and nutrient content (i.e. nutritional value of reef fish), limiting the ability of management to sustain the productivity of nutritious catches. Here, we use modelled growth coefficients and nutrient concentrations to develop a new metric of nutrient productivity of coral reef fishes. We then evaluate this metric with underwater visual surveys of reef fish assemblages from four tropical countries to examine nutrient productivity of reef fish food webs. Species' growth coefficients were associated with nutrients that vary with body size (calcium, iron, selenium and zinc), but not total nutrient density. When integrated with fish abundance data, we find that herbivorous species typically dominate standing biomass, biomass turnover and nutrient production on coral reefs. Such bottom-heavy trophic distributions of nutrients were consistent across gradients of fishing pressure and benthic composition. We conclude that management restrictions that promote sustainability of herbivores and other low trophic-level species can sustain biomass and nutrient production from reef fisheries that is critical to the food security of over 500 million people in the tropics.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

When a temperature difference is created across the TEG modules, an electromotive force will be generated if the modules are connected in an electric circuit with a load. As the planet aims to reduce its carbon footprint clean methods of generating electricity are increasing in demand, and therefore so is the research into the use of TEG modules.This research aimed to determine how TEGs could be used in utilising the temperature difference between the inside of a small submarine and the water which surrounds it and predict how much electrical power could be produced. This was done using both Ansys software and physical experiments. A test rig was built to emulate the conditions which would be experienced by the TEG modules in a submarine, with a warmer constant temperature on one side and the other side cooled by flowing chilled water. Many materials and the potential addition of heat transfer fins were tested, and all experimental tests performed were then simulated in Ansys Fluent and Thermal Electric to ascertain how accurate the simulations represent real-world results. The tests were performed from temperatures ranges between approximately 5⁰C ≤ T ≤ 20⁰C, it was decided that all temperatures 17⁰C and below simulated in Ansys would give a fair representation of how much power the TEGs could produce.Using the information from these tests and simulations, scaled up models we simulated in Ansys to model the TEG modules in a submarine section. These results showed that the use of heat transfer fins was not necessary due to the thickness of the submarine wall and the velocity at which the submarine would travel. At a temperature difference of 15⁰C between the inside of the submarine and the water flowing around it, four TEG modules connected in series can be expected to produce 0.35W.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Fish, rich in micronutrients, have potential for improving the nutritional status of coastal and riparian communities, particularly in the Global South where inadequate nutrition is prevalent. Yet, the potential for fish to alleviate malnutrition remains limited to policy documents and high-level government commitments. We propose an agenda for NSG in the Global South grounded in three main pillars: 1-extending the boundaries of fisheries governance, 2-integrating multiple forms of knowledge, and 3-prioritizing domestic and local needs; each of these pillars links different levels of governance starting at the level of conceptualization and images connected to what fisheries are and should do, to a more policy-oriented level with hands-on recommendations, through an intermediate level that links the two. Overall, we propose a concept and agenda for NSG grounded in a human-centred approach to fisheries governance with social sciences playing a crucial role in unearthing the nodes of power that limit access and agency of poor and vulnerable (fishing) communities to the nutritional benefits of fish. In doing so, we critically analyze dominant fisheries governance agendas (‘Blue Economy’, ‘Blue Growth’) through the lens of food and nutrition security and anchor these debates to the objective of getting the right nutrients to those who need them most","Marine","University of Lancaster"

It provides useful information for marine studies and guides the design of maritime structures. One of the challenges in the statistical estimation of DWS is to account for the circular nature of direction. To address this issue, this paper considers the 1-dimensional case of the direction-only DWS (DWSd) and applies the circular regression to smooth the DWSd observations. This paper then improves an existing clustering algorithm by incorporating circular smoothing in the clustering algorithm, automating the determination of the optimal number of clusters, and designing a more appropriate smoothing parameter selection procedure for data with correlated errors. Our simulation studies reveal an improvement in the performance of estimating the underlying DWSd using the circular smoother. Finally, the linear and circular smoothers are compared by clustering two real datasets, one from the Sofar Ocean network and the second from a buoy located at the Red Sea. For the Sofar Ocean data, clustering with the two smoothers results in different number of clusters. For the Red Sea data, a cluster with a peak at the boundary is only identified when the circular smoother is used.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Although isotopic equilibrium of CH4 and CO2 has been observed in microbial CBG and SG basins, it is difficult to judge under what geological conditions equilibrium is achieved. Moreover, the effects of CO2 dissolution on the isotopic fractionation process need to be considered. We use data from eight microbial CBG and SG basins to discuss the geological conditions in which equilibrium and kinetic isotopic fractionation in CH4-CO2-HCO3− system is achieved. Based on isotopic equilibrium temperatures calculated using computer codes developed in MatLab software, we show that, in deep and closed reservoirs, the CH4-CO2 and CH4-HCO3− are close to carbon isotope equilibrium. In contrast, in shallow and open reservoirs, they are in disequilibrium. The CO2-HCO3− is in disequilibrium in most reservoirs. We propose that both low free energy gradients and long coexisting time of CH4 and CO2/HCO3− are necessary to attain isotopic equilibrium. However, it is difficult to accurately estimate the timescale for attaining isotope equilibrium among them. In general, a closed and deep CBG/SG reservoir is likely to be geologically and geochemically stable over long timescales, favoring isotopic equilibrium of CH4-CO2 and CH4-HCO3−. However, a shallow and open reservoir is unfavourable for their isotopic equilibrium due to shorter timescales for the coexistence of CH4-CO2-HCO3−. Using data from systems close to equilibrium, we estimated the percentage of CO2 in total CH4 and CO2 in CBG reservoirs in various basins to be from 27% to 50%, where methanogenesis is mainly by CO2 reduction. This is significantly higher than the CO2 content (1% to 15%) in gaseous CH4 and CO2 in these basins but is consistent with those (36% to 48%) from culture experiments for coal conversion by methanogenesis. Further study shows that 53–99% of the CO2 formed during CBG generation has dissolved into groundwaters to form dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in CBG reservoirs. We propose that CO2 dissolution likely has significantly affect the abundance and isotopic compositions of gaseous CO2 in subsurface.","Marine","University of Lancaster"

Composite materials can thus be utilised in marine riser engineering to provide lightweight, fatigue-resistant, corrosion-resistant, low-bending stiffness and high-strength characteristics. In this paper, the history and potential of composite marine risers, including the first successful deployment of a composite riser joint offshore on the Heidrun Platform in 1995, are reviewed.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the introduction of CaSiO3 to a WPI hydrogel matrix on its physicochemical, mechanical, and biological properties. Our Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy results showed that CaSiO3 was successfully incorporated into the WPI hydrogel matrix to create composite biomaterials. Swelling tests indicated that the addition of 5% (w/v) CaSiO3 caused greater swelling compared to biomaterials without CaSiO3 and ultimate compressive strength and strain at break. Cell culture experiments demonstrated that WPI hydrogel biomaterials enriched with CaSiO3 demonstrated superior cytocompatibility in vitro compared to the control hydrogel biomaterials without CaSiO3.

The composition of the lower atmosphere forms the background upon which regional air pollution builds, and may thus have a substantial impact on air quality in many parts of the world. The source of some of these pollutants is natural, associated with vegetation, soils, fires, lightning, and descent of air from the stratosphere, while others arise from human activity associated with industry, power generation, transport, residential sources, and agriculture. While some pollutants are emitted directly, others such as ozone may be formed through photochemical processes in the atmosphere from precursors emitted elsewhere. These longer-lived pollutants are transported and dispersed around the globe, reaching even the cleanest and most remote of locations, and this contributes to poor air quality and environmental damage in unpopulated polar and oceanic regions. Atmospheric concentrations of many longer-lived pollutants are continuing to build up in the atmosphere associated with increased anthropogenic emissions, and this is likely to influence future air quality around the globe.

The optimal chemical composition of the resulting WPI/CS hydrogels was chosen based on the morphology, structural properties, chemical stability, swelling ratio, wettability, mechanical properties, bioactivity, and cytotoxicity evaluation. The hydrogels with CS incorporated in powder form exhibited superior mechanical properties and higher porosity, whereas those with CS incorporated after dissolution showed enhanced wettability, which decreased with increasing CS content.

However, enhancements to PUREX are needed for future fuel cycles to improve its proliferation resistance, its capability to handle higher burnup fuels and to minimize its waste arisings. A key objective within the development of an Advanced PUREX process is the effective control of the actinides U, neptunium (Np) and Pu within a single cycle flowsheet. Simple hydroxamic acids such as acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) have the abilityto strip Pu(IV) and Np(IV) from tri-butyl phosphate into nitric acid and have thus been identified as suitable reagents for this purpose. Utilising this in an Advanced PUREX process will ultimately allow for the generation of a co-processed Pu/Np product and a high purity U product, addressing some of the shortcomings of traditional PUREX.There are however a few key knowledge gaps that must be addressed before AHA can be implemented in such a process. Firstly, it is known that simple hydroxamic acids hydrolyse to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the parent carboxylic acid in acidic media, the former product being known to react autocatalytically / explosively with nitric acid which is ubiquitous in reprocessing flowsheets. Whether the reaction mechanism or product distribution changes when the AHA is complexed to a metal ion is unclear. Additionally,observations that Pu(IV) is reduced to Pu(III) during complex hydrolysis have opened up the possibility of their use as replacements for U(IV)/N2H4 or NH2OH in advanced PUREX processes, but whether the reducing agent is the hydroxamate itself, or NH2OH, is still in question.To answer these questions, Fe(III) has been used as a non-active analogue to Pu(IV) and Np(IV), as it exhibits analogous complexation with AHA and whilst thermodynamically possible, redox chemistry mechanistically analogous to that of Pu(IV) is thought to be kinetically hindered at high hydrogen ion concentrations to the point where it can be ignored on the timescales of AHA hydrolysis. However, initial studies by Raman spectroscopy showed identical AHA hydrolysis products in the absence and presence of initial Fe(III), but with differing final yields. Further quantification techniques were then explored including a titrimetric method for hydroxylamine, UV-Vis spectroscopy fornitrous acid and Fe(II), and ion chromatography (IC) for multiple species, all of which suggested redox chemistry akin to Pu(IV).A library of data to describe these systems has been gathered utilising a single column ion chromatography system to measure a number of key ions over time in nitric acid solutions of varying temperatures and initial Fe(III) and AHA concentrations. These key species include the acetate ion (CH3COO-) and protonated hydroxylamine (NH3OH+) from the hydrolysis of AHA, and the reduced form of the metal ion, Fe(II), which has been not previously been seen during hydrolysis of the Fe(III)-AHA complex. Our analysis therefore shows that the current definition of Fe(III) as a non-oxidizing metal ion with regards to AHA needs revising. Using CH3COOingrowth as a direct measure of AHA loss and assuming redox chemistry of Fe(III) mechanistically analogous to Pu(IV), thesestudies have additionally been combined with kinetic modelling in the software platform gPROMS (General PROcess Modelling System), and have thus provided key insights into the nature of the reducing agent in these systems.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

As global food systems come under increasing pressure from the future impacts of climate change and other global crises, the need to provide a stable, readily available supply of healthy, nutritious produce is increasingly important. Whilst plasticulture is considered an effective measure to maintain food security and increase agricultural productivity, there is a global call to reduce plastic use in agriculture. The impact of plastics from ‘cradle-to-grave’ are overwhelmingly negative, thought to compromise long-term agricultural productivity, human and planetary health. Even though there is an urgent call to reduce plastic use in agriculture, we are not equipped with an adequate knowledge base to assess and reevaluate plasticulture. Our understanding of plasticulture and its importance in food systems has not yet been comprehensively assessed. In parallel, the implications of plastic use in agricultural systems are not fully understood, in particular the quantification of microplastics in agricultural soils and risks to future agroecosystem functioning. This thesis presents a review of the UK food system and a meta-analysis to explore the relative importance of plasticulture. The meta-analysis found that plasticulture is key to increasing the yield of globally-important crops in agricultural systems worldwide. This is followed by a nationwide survey, soil archive analysis and a mesocosm experiment that investigate microplastic concentrations, fate and impacts in agricultural soils. The nationwide survey suggests that plastic crop covers are a significant contributor of microplastics to agricultural soils. Analysis of the Rothamsted soil archive revealed that agricultural soils are receptors of microplastic pollution from different agricultural sources and non-agricultural sources which predate modern plasticulture. A mesocosm experiment was used to determine the effects of microplastics on soil and crop health, as well as the influence of soil and crop type on microplastic transport. The results from the mesocosm experiment indicate microplastics pollution affects agroecosystem functioning. This thesis is an essential contribution to producing a comprehensive assessment of plastic use in agriculture in future food systems. The findings from this thesis highlight an urgent need to reassess plastic use in agriculture. Sustainable plasticulture will be vital to build the resilience of a future food system that prioritises human and planetary health.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

In this process, the Nigerians had allies in the British High Commission in Lagos and the Foreign (and Commonwealth) Office, as well as substantial leverage as a result of Indian and Soviet competition in the Nigerian market for military assistance. Yet this leverage was mitigated by the Federals’ preference for British over Indian military assistance, and fear of becoming too reliant on Moscow. Not only in the British, but also in the Nigerian case, diplomatic concerns thus outweighed the military rationale for the naval training team, and this ‘diplomacy of military assistance’ contrasts with the basic tenor of the theoretical literature on military assistance in civil wars.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

This article answers that question through a study of five firms that supplied gunpowder to the slave trade. It first demonstrates that the Atlantic slavery trade certainly expanded Britain's explosives industry during the eighteenth century. British merchant capitalists established five plants in the proximity of Bristol and Liverpool to meet African demand, provincializing the gunpowder industry for the first time. The slave trade also inflated the gunpowder industry's volume, with twelve percent of all powder going to Africa before abolition. This article next reveals that supplying the slave trade was likely a lucrative pursuit for British manufacturers, with investors in the five mills earning profits that exceeded those of slaving. The boost given to the explosives industry faded considerably as abolition neared, however, and so this article concludes that Atlantic slavery's stimulus was likely of limited importance for driving the later Industrial Revolution.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

The plethora of new agendas promoting health and wellbeing in cities meanwhile are accompanied by visions of clean, green and daylit urban environments. If we follow Braun’s (2005) assertion that urbanisation is a spatialisation of nature then what is made visible through these representations is a highly sanitised version of urban nature. Of specific interest here is the invisibility of urban natures at night. More-than-human places may be legible in the daytime city but are far less so after dark. Where darkness is evident in visions for urban futures it is typically symbolic of the dystopic, dirty, and dangerous. Within such images urban nature is implied as foreboding – the more-than-human is unknown and uncanny – hence the deployment of excessive artificial illumination to offer reassurance they are under control and safe. This chapter, therefore, examines how multispecies life is encountered in the nocturnal city and the multisensory experiences that are produced when visual perception is less reliable or dominant in interpreting the nature of such places. Drawing on a series of nightwalks across the city of Manchester, UK, to illustrate the entanglements between human and more-than-human, bodies and landscape, and place and time, this work considers how we might evolve a ‘making-with’ (Haraway 2016) approach for the design of the multispecies nocturnal city. Adopting an ecology-centred rather than human-centred perspective for the way urban futures are conceived, it seeks to challenge the prevailing trends of urban nature as subservient to human needs and desires in order to reimagine how a more-than-human nocturnal urbanism can enable greater visibility of such coexistences.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

This ‘entente cordiale’ was underpinned by the friendship of Houphouët-Boigny and the Nigerian Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, who were both anti-communist, pro-western, capitalist, and in favour of African co-operation instead of integration. Yet it was Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah who, through his criticism and alleged subversive machinations against Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria, gave the two countries their common purpose. Focusing, unlike previous scholarship, on the military and strategic responses of Abidjan and Lagos to Accra, and based on multi-archival research, this article argues that the Nkrumah factor brought about a strategic alignment between Côte d’Ivoire and Nigeria. It also shows, however, that despite a common threat assessment, domestic politics had a decisive and diverging impact on the foreign and security policies of the two states, and that regional and colonial legacies turned out to have a more significant impact on early postcolonial Africa than did the Cold War. The article sheds light on African agency, while simultaneously going beyond and, more significantly, offering an alternative perspective to the Cold War-driven historiography of early postcolonial Africa, and its tendency to focus on external rather than African actors.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

To what extent are school uniform policies compliant with the DfE School Uniform Guidance? 1.1	Does the uniform policy specify different clothing for boys and girls?1.2	Are girls and LGBTQ+ pupils disadvantaged by the policy options they are given?2.	Can school uniform policies support gender equity? 2.1	What explanations are given for the choice of current policy?2.2	How could the school adapt the policy to provide equal and appropriate provision for LGBTQ+ children? 2.3	Are there any barriers to making these changes and how could these be overcome? I draw on interviews with staff and governors at fifteen primary schools in Nottinghamshire to answer these questions. I argue that in its present format the DfE Guidance has had a limited impact on uniform equity. Nearly a decade since it was first published schools continue to maintain policies that do not account for cultural needs and have a huge financial impact on low-income families. Furthermore, many only recognise the gender binary and have gender biased uniform specifications that disadvantage girls and LGBTQ+ children. This study makes an original contribution to current discourses about school uniform legislation through a consideration of the impact of school uniform policies on LGBTQ+ children. I assert that a primary factor contributing to the success or failure of schools to provide gender equity is awareness, not a lack of skill, time, or money. Neither legislation or funding currently protects LGBTQ+ children from experiencing less than equal provision within the English education system. I recommend that the Department of Education passes legislation requiring all schools in England to implement inclusive, non-prescriptive, gender-neutral school uniform policies.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

More specifically, who provides the soundtrack? This chapter presents a soundscape walk of the urban night through the inner-city area of Cheetham Hill in Manchester, UK. The district is home to a multi-ethnic community, the result of several waves of immigration to Britain. In the mid-19th century, it drew Irish people fleeing the Great Famine, with Jews settling in the area in the late-19th and early 20th centuries as they fled persecution in continental Europe. During the 1950s and 1960s, migrants from the Indian subcontinent and Caribbean established new communities in Cheetham Hill. More recently it has become home for people from Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Far East. It is immigration policy as urban landscape and its music is vibrant, discordant, and ever-mutating. Of particular interest here is the way in which sounds bleed into one another, creating interstitial zones for the nightwalker where the city’s music is unintentionally remixed. By moving through place, the manifold tones and rhythms are recomposed in an improvisational way. This chapter discusses the mobile music of Cheetham Hill as an on-going entanglement that occurs at the boundaries of body and urban landscape, sound and time, identity and place.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

Rather than considering ‘the structure of the work of art as something statically inherent in the text,’ she explains, ‘we need to recognize the dynamic situation in which the reader, in the give-and-take with the text, senses or organizes a relationship among the various parts of his lived-through experience.’Rosenblatt also talks of ‘text events’ as a way to explain the very particular experience of reading a particular text at a particular place or time.Cue my memoir Versions of a Life so Far: Tales from the Ceiling, which is built around a series of ‘text events,’ that is to say encounters with certain texts at certain points in my life, in particular my childhood years.These years belong primary to the 1960s and early 1970s, and so reflect the foundational text events of my life. Most notably, and at the heart of my text-sense of family, was the Laura Ingalls Wilder Little House on the Prairie series. But I have expanded the definition of text to include artifacts, colours, and photographs, among other ‘text events.’ And as I relate and indeed re-enact my encounters with these texts, I find myself experimenting with form in various ways. The result is that the conventional prose of memoir here becomes a shifting of point-of-view as well as a vacillating chronology.By retelling the story or stories of my early life through its textual events, I have sought to produce a text that is itself an event in the sense that these ‘versions’ are at once representativeof a single life (so far), but exist also in the segmented way that a life unfolds.

The rule of sovereignty has taken centre stage in these discussions and is said to be preferred to the non-intervention rule because it evades the problem of coercion. Proponents of the cyber rule of sovereignty contend that there is such a rule; Opponents reject the existence of the rule as a matter of existing law. The objective here is to explore the methodologies involved in the identification of the cyber rule of sovereignty under customary international law. The work first frames the debate in the language of regulative and constitutive rules, allowing us to show that a regulative rule of sovereignty can, logically, and necessarily, be deduced from the constitutive rule of sovereignty. The content of the regulative rule can also be deduced from the constitutive rule of sovereignty, but it has a more limited scope than claimed by the proponents of the rule, notably the Tallinn Manual 2.0. The rule of sovereignty prohibits State cyber operations carried out on the territory of the target State and remote cyber operations which involve the exercise of sovereign authority on that territory, e.g., police evidence gathering operations. The rule of sovereignty does not, however, prohibit other remote, ex situ State cyber operations, even those targeting ICTs used for governmental functions, including the conduct of elections. The rule of sovereignty is not, then, the solution to the problem of election hacking.  ","Navy","University of Lancaster"

Several of the PPI implementation challenges reported in prior research originate in the institutional architecture underpinning demand articulation, and innovation procurement and adoption processes. We conceptualise innovation intermediaries as institutional entrepreneurs who seek to create new institutions or adjust existing ones to support PPI implementation. We report the results of two case studies of intermediaries facilitating PPI in the UK defence and health sectors, respectively. We contribute to PPI intermediation literature by showing that intermediaries address prevalent institutional failures through four types of institutional entrepreneurship activities: boundary spanning; advocacy; design of change; and capacity building. We elucidate, in particular, the role of individuals within intermediaries, as agents who learn about failures and adapt their institutional work over time. In doing so, these managers go beyond the remit and goals of the organisations they represent. The findings add to our understanding of how intermediaries support demand articulation for PPI by showing that their institutional work is also aimed at designing generic methods and processes to improve what is asked for, and how. We furthermore reveal conditions influencing the effectiveness of intermediaries’ efforts to realise institutional change, thereby extending research on institutional entrepreneurship in PPI settings.

Many regional states — including U.S. allies —  are beginning to seriously consider how they would respond to a potential use of force by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). But analytic attention has focused overwhelmingly on the worst-case scenario of a PRC invasion, largely ignoring more likely contingencies calculated to stay below the threshold of lethal force. It is in this “gray zone” that the PRC has made strategic advances in the East and South China Seas in recent years.This paper argues that, compared with an invasion or blockade of Taiwan’s main island, an operation to capture one or more offshore islands currently controlled by the Republic of China (ROC or Taiwan) would offer Beijing considerable advantages. In an immediate tactical sense, it would offer Beijing greater flexibility and escalation control, lower risk of civilian casualties, and less likelihood of sparking a strong Taiwanese response or U.S. intervention. Strategically, such an operation could open up an array of options for further probes, faits accomplis, information gathering, and coercive pressure on ROC forces—and, in the case of the Penghu (Pescadores) Islands, substantial opportunities for enhanced surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistical support for a future invasion of the main island. Domestically, in contrast with a bloody and potentially catastrophic all-out invasion or a blockade that would risk conflict with the United States, outlying island seizure could offer Beijing a low-risk yet highly symbolic rallying point in a period of likely economic struggles and rising social dissatisfaction.Policymakers and strategists on all sides of politics in Taiwan, the United States and elsewhere need to carefully consider how they would respond to such contingencies, in order to enable an effective international response.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

Mobile health (m-health) apps, one form of digital technology, are increasingly being used to promote positive health related behavior change. Therefore, it is important to conduct research to understand the efficacy of m-health apps. The process of participant recruitment is an essential component in producing strong research evidence, along with ensuring an adequately powered sample to conduct meaningful analyses and draw robust conclusions.Methods:In this work we outline and reflect on the strategies used to recruit help-seeking military veterans into an intervention study, which aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an app (Drinks:Ration) to modify behavior in alcohol misusers. Recruitment strategies included through (1) partner organizations and (2) social media and Facebook advertising (ads).Results:Facebook ads were live for a period of 88 days and were viewed by a total audience of 29,416 people. In total 168 military veterans were recruited across all recruitment strategies, meaning that Drinks:Ration exceeded its recruitment targets. Half of the sample (n = 84) were recruited through social media, including Facebook ads.Conclusions:The current article highlighted that targeted Facebook ads were an efficient strategy to recruit military veterans into a digital intervention trial aiming to reduce alcohol consumption because they reduced the amount of time and resources required to contact a large number of potentially eligible individuals for our study.

They are often associated with psychological and metabolic comorbidities, which can impact on patient quality of life (QOL) and on the self-management of these diseases. Regular assessment of patient needs, comorbidities and feedback is a critical step in the development of decision-analytic models. Currently, no intervention is available to regularly assess such patients’ needs and comorbidities and support their involvement in the decision-making and self-management of their morbidity and comorbidities. The aim of this research is to involve the patients in decision making of their care and to support their self-management by the use of a paper questionnaire (study tool) at each consultation.Objective: To explore the acceptability and potential of a self-developed paper questionnaire that constituted a study tool for addressing the needs, comorbidities, and feedback of patients with psoriasis and eczema and supporting their involvement in decision making and self-management of their chronic conditions.Method: A mixed method study was conducted and included a postal survey on adult male and female patients with psoriasis and eczema, using the study tool, which is a paper questionnaire and contains the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and seven supplementary open-ended questions to capture patients’ views, feedback, comorbidities, coping status and needs. The survey was followed by semi-structured face-to-face interviews with a sample of the patients who had participated in the survey. The aims of the interviews were two-fold: 1. to gain a deeper understanding of their experience of living with and managing their skin disease; and 2. to gather patient feedback on the service they received as well as their views on using the new study tool or any alternative intervention to address and support their self-management. The final study was a pilot which involved presenting a proposal of an online version of the study tool to a group of healthcare experts asking them to critically review the extent to which the online model responded to patients expressed needs.Results: Of the 114 patients who participated in the postal survey 108 (94.7%) of them expressed physical, metabolic and psychological comorbidities. Stress was identified as the dominant disease-triggering factor in 72 (63%) participants. Thirty-three (28.9%) of participants reported that they could not cope with their chronic illness. Eighteen (15.7%) participants suffered from anxiety, and 12 (10.5%) had depression and suicidal thoughts. Twenty-nine (25%) participants addressed their needs for support at home, and 16 (14%) of them asked for support at work. In the patient feedback section, 21 (18.4%) and 9 (7.8%) participants rated the service they received from their general practitioner (GP) and dermatologist as poor, respectively. In the interviews, all the participants 22 (100%) welcomed the use of the study tool on a regular basis to address their needs, comorbidities and feedback. Nineteen (86.3%) of them suggested that they would prefer using an online version of the tool or patient portal system as a convenient way of remote and interactive communication with the healthcare provider, particularly during the worsening of their skin condition. In the final pilot study, the healthcare experts agreed that the proposed online version of the study tool could be a convenient platform for such patients to support their self-management. They discussed the potential importance of such a tool if it provided them with access to supportive services such as patient information on skin diseases and self-management, access to local mental health service and other relevant psoriasis and eczema patients’ support groups and charities.Conclusion: This novel mixed method research identified knowledge gaps in managing patients with psoriasis and eczema. It provided a new tool that has the potential to regularly engage and assess patients’ unmet needs, comorbidities and feedback. The tool can involve patients in decision-making and offers them the autonomy to disclose heterogeneous needs that may support their self-management. All the interviewees welcomed regular use of the study tool and the majority of them suggested that they would prefer using an online version of the tool if it was available. Future research is needed to assess the impact of the study tool in filling important gaps in patient self-management and in health service improvement.","Navy","University of Lancaster"
"A Novel Danced: A Nietzschean Approach to Long-Form Prose-Fiction Through Somatic Practice","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-novel-danced(b4797efe-e745-417a-b96d-b396239b915b).html","None","2023","This practice-based PhD project consists of two parts: a novel titled Ecstatic (worth 80% of the overall submission) and a critical thesis (20%). It concerns the connection between verbal and non-verbal forms of expression, specifically the extent to which dance practices can engender or inform prose fiction. I am concerned with the relationship between narrative and the moving body, and with questions of simultaneity and (in)congruence, with a particular focus on ways in which, for creative purposes, the expressive body might be experienced at the same time as the writing mind. To explore these questions, I conjugate different methodologies of writing, traditional and experimental, to find the most effective expression of dance in prose. I take the dancing body as both theme and narrative for my novel Ecstatic. In so doing I am asking how successfully the contemporary novel as form can articulate the dancing body. This plays itself out most straightforwardly at the levels of narrative, character and location: the setting is an alternative dance community; the story is told from the perspectives of five different bodies/characters as we follow them through a period of social violence and unrest. Short chapters, focused on individuals, are punctuated by extended sessions of improvised dance in which the bodies/characters encounter each other and become entangled in unanticipated ways. Dance itself becomes the activity and the site of salvation, inspiration and destruction.In the academic thesis, my primary theoretical framework is Nietzschean philosophy and more specifically, those aspects of what I call the Nietzschean “counter-tradition” to dualist thinking. This counter-tradition reflects profoundly on the grounding of experience in the body, on an understanding of the self as multiple rather than unitary, and on the move away from ideologies based in binary notions of self/other and body/mind, rooted in Platonic idealism. Ideas of congruence and incongruence define my exploration of the ways in which “writing the body” has been practised and theorised, covering performance practices, traditional literary writing, feminist theory, cognitive science, and recent philosophies of consciousness. I assert that Nietzsche’s ecstatic paradigm provides an enabling frame for my research, specifically as his critique of Platonic dualism engages with the splitting of the distinctive creative forces he terms Apollonian and Dionysian. In considering how the moving body figures in Nietzsche’s writing, and the profound influence of Nietzsche on early twentieth century dance pioneers, thinkers and novelists, I explore the proposition that the notion of dance itself embodies Nietzsche’s most persuasive response to the sense of despair, loneliness, and fear implicit in the claim that “God is dead, and we have killed him”.In the second half of this thesis, I asses my own novel in terms of the English-language novelistic tradition within which I work, offering several “snapshots” of how certain writers have thus far examined the dancing body, and indeed thought with the body within the novel. With Nietzsche as my guide, I assess the results of my experimentation with two specific somatic methodologies: Ecstatic Dance and Authentic Movement. In a series of practical case studies and with analysis of passages from my novel, I explore how effective these practices are for the dancing novelist. In the conclusion, I summarise my discoveries of this largely Nietzschean approach to the moving body and creative writing, pointing to future research that builds on these discoveries. Alluding to Deleuze’s concept of transcendental immanence, I suggest potential connections with Authentic Movement, a somatic practice in which the mover’s awareness can expand to embrace and bear witness to past narrative at the same time as present movement: the “languaging” of direct bodily experience on consciously different levels correlates to the spread consciousness of the novelistic voice.  ","Navy","University of Lancaster"
"The University as a Socio-Material Assemblage: Promotional Videos—Codes, Territories, and Globalization","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-university-as-a-sociomaterial-assemblage(affd5b17-ce8a-47f7-992b-8223639fc06e).html","None","2023","The objective of this thesis is to explore and subsequently develop the concept of the university as a socio-material assemblage with regard to three key concepts of assemblage theory: codes, territories, and globalization (different from the traditional views of globalization). The thesis does this building on a multimodal analysis of data gathered from 26 promotional YouTube videos from UK and Canadian universities. It introduces a new middle-range (mesolevel) theoretical framework by combining concepts from assemblage theory (AT) (DeLanda, 2006; Deleuze & Guattari, 2013), and the inquiry graphics approach (IG) (Lacković, 2020).The methodology focuses on exploring the meanings of the universities’ spaces, physical objects, actors (human and non-human), and the relationshipsamong actors through inquiry graphics analytical lenses. It then establishes codes and territories based on the analysis that territorialize the university as an assemblage, as well as the decodifying and deterritorializing processes within it. Finally, it analyses the observed codes and territories through the lenses of homogenization and hybridization globalization theories.The thesis concludes that the university can be conceptualized and interpreted as a socio-material assemblage whose components are interrelated and have both material and social expressive roles. Further, codes and territories are defined by the strength of the links between their iconic and symbolic expressions. Each university assemblage is connected to other assemblages through the various multi-layered networks that each component belongs to, yet the interaction among the components of an assemblage is interpreted within its specific territories, codes, and semiotic systems. These in turn, are defined by applying the semiotic principles of the IG approach.Finally, the thesis makes three major contributions: it conceptualizes the university as a socio-material assemblage, it develops a middle-range theoretical framework by combining concepts from assemblage theory and the inquiry graphics approach that can be applied to understand other sociomaterial assemblages, and it explains the relation between globalization, territorialization and codification of universities as socio-material assemblages.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

"‘Heroes to anonymous pensioners’: Francisco Franco's ‘mutilated gentlemen’ and the erosion of veteran privilege in Spain's transition to democracy","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/heroes-to-anonymous-pensioners(da054ed8-d22c-4874-8ae6-4d99234ed6cf).html","Wright, S.","30/09/2022","This article explores how during Spain's transition to democracy in the 1970s and 1980s, Francoist disabled veterans of the Spanish Civil War navigated the disappearance of formerly hegemonic historical narratives which had hitherto defined their relationship with the state. While for Republican disabled veterans of the Civil War, the transition brought a degree of legitimisation, political emancipation and financial recognition, for Franco's Caballeros Mutilados or ‘Mutilated Gentlemen’ the advent of democracy prompted a re-evaluation of their wounds, their legitimacy and the privileges they had hitherto enjoyed. In the post-dictatorship era, Francoist disabled veterans – who unlike Republican veterans, had enjoyed uncontested legitimacy under the regime – were viewed as inconvenient symbols of Francoism, and faced the challenge of preserving the legitimacy of their veteranhood in the age of democracy. In this sense, the case of the Francoist war disabled of the Spanish Civil War underscores the close link between historical memory and the well-being of the veterans of civil wars. While post-civil war governments often privilege certain disabled bodies over others, this is a precarious privilege that remains vulnerable to political fluctuations over time, as well as the shifting relationship between army, nation and state. In such cases, the ability of disabled veterans’ groups to adapt to changing perceptions of their right to support is crucial to the preservation of their veteranhood, as well as their ability to advocate for improved circumstances more broadly.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

Existing airport slot allocation models treat declared capacity as an exogenously defined deterministic parameter. In this presentation we propose a new robust optimization formulation based on the concept of stability radius. The proposed formulation considers endogenously the airport’s declared capacity and expresses it as a function of its throughput. We present results from the application of the proposed approach to a congested airport and we discuss the trade-off between the declared capacity of the airport and the efficiency of the slot allocation process.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

Drawing on a complex adaptive system and stewardship perspective, this study examines the role of death in entrepreneuring in four entrepreneurial families. With the loss of a leading family member in business, social processes of adaptation in entrepreneurial trajectories are revealed. Our analysis shows that these processes allow members to reorganize, recalibrate, and reconnect aspects of family and business. Our study contributes to understanding social processes in entrepreneuring by capturing how death can influence entrepreneurial choices and progression over time, focusing on what family entrepreneurs do. Conceptualizing the family as a complex adaptive system contributes to a theoretical perspective of stewardship as fluid and collective.","Navy","University of Lancaster"

It commences by introducing the challenges of assessing coastal vulnerability, before reviewing methods used to assess coastal vulnerability, problems of parameter scarcity in data poor countries and the benefits of using SAR data to derive such parameters.  Three analytical chapters then describe the methods used to derive the relevant shoreline parameters, shoreline change rate and assess vulnerability along the eastern coastline of the Niger Delta.Firstly, this study focuses on exploring and testing the capability of using multitemporal waterlines from SAR images to derive shoreline positions at high and low tidal states. From 54 Sentinel-1 images recorded in 2017, the study selected 12 images to represent both high and low tidal states. These were spread across the wet and dry seasons to take account of seasonal differences. Shoreline positions were obtained by identifying the land-water boundary via segmentation using histogram-minimum thresholding; vectorizing and smoothing that boundary; and averaging its position over multiple waterlines. Accuracy was assessed against reference waterlines derived manually from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument optical imagery. The land-water segmentation had an overall accuracy of 95-99%. It showed differences between wet and dry season shoreline positions in areas dominated by complex creek networks, but similarities along open coasts. The SAR-derived shorelines deviated from the reference lines by a maximum of 43m (approximately four pixels), and often less than 10m (one pixel) in most locations (open coast, estuarine, complex creek networks) at high and low tide. The notable exception was the low tide line in areas with extensive inter-tidal flats. In those cases, the processing method picked up apparently subtle variations, which led to it identifying shorelines 70 to 370m from the reference lines. However, for applications such as coastal vulnerability assessment, the high tide shoreline is of greater importance, thus, depending on the application of interest, problems with low tide shoreline delineation may be irrelevant. Overall, despite limitations, notably the relatively small number of images available that were recorded at high or low tide, the method provides a simple, objective, and cost-effective approach to monitoring shorelines at high and low tide.Secondly, this study demonstrates the capability of Sentinel-1 SAR data for assessing multiannual shoreline position change. On the basis of the criterion that the Sentinel-1 data were acquired at a high tidal state for Bonny in the Niger delta region, 36 images were chosen from 255 images recorded between 2015 and 2020 to represent 6 for each year. The study developed a simple and systematic GIS-based approach which provides an accessible way forward for coastal change assessment in data-poor countries. The shoreline was split spatially using sediment cells as a convenient, well-established approach to assess the spatial heterogeneity of its change processes, which will aid in identifying their causes and mechanisms. The result of the SAR imagery over the full 5-year timescale shows that the coastline is eroding more than it is accreting, but that there are areas of both net erosion (cells II, IV, VI, VII, and VIII) and accretion (cells I, III, and V) over this timescale. The result of the analysis Sentinel-1 imageries for both the multi-annual scale and seasonal change indicates the areas of coastlines nearer river mouths are more prone to change compared to those further from river mouths and on uninterrupted strand coasts. Also, the result of shoreline orientation and shoreline position change gives some localised suggestions of a relationship, which could be taken to imply the influence of wave action on shoreline position change. This approach has the potential to provide an effective coastal change monitoring capability for coastal modellers, scientists and government agencies that would enable them to develop a coastal zone framework for effective planning and management.Thirdly, this study utilised a GIS approach to derive the shoreline position, coastal elevation, and calculate CVI. The shoreline parameters are derived from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery (2015–2020), while the coastal elevation and other parameters are derived from different open-access and commercial DEMs, and literature, respectively. In addition, the parameters are ranked on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing ""very low"" vulnerability and 5 representing ""very high"" vulnerability based on the existing ranking approach. These rankings are used to calculate the sensitive for the specified coastal vulnerability index (CVI5). The result of CVI indicates spatial variation that is dependent on the shoreline change method and coastal elevation derived from different DEMs since other parameters were assigned constant values across the coastline. The analysis of CVI using the EPR and LRR methods to derive shoreline change rates reveals modest spatial variations in vulnerability. Further on, coastal elevation derived from different DEMs has been shown to have more influence on the spatial variation of the CVI.  The MERIT product results in the largest proportion of the coastline being assigned to the high and very high vulnerability categories compared to other open-access DEMs. The findings provide a valuable tool for stakeholders and decision-makers to develop strategies for sustainable coastal zone management and coastal protection and adaptation to climate change-related risks in the Niger delta coastal environment (ICZM).  Despite these limitations, this study has demonstrated that the open-source data can be effectively used for assessing coastal vulnerability across the Niger Delta region. Overall, this study demonstrates how open-source products can be used to assess coastal vulnerability across data poor regions such as the Niger Delta.  It has highlighted spatial variations in coastal vulnerability which are important given the social, economic and environmental characteristics of this low-lying landscape and threat of climate-change induced sea level rise.

The measured global average Cl-VSLS mixing ratios, from 0.2 to 13 km altitude, were 46.6 ppt (CH2Cl2), 9.6 ppt (CHCl3), 7.8 ppt (1,2-DCA), and 0.84 ppt (C2Cl4) measured by the NSF NCAR Trace Organic Analyzer (TOGA) during ATom. Both measurements and model show distinct hemispheric gradients with the mean measured Northern to Southern Hemisphere (NH/SH) ratio of 2 or greater for all four Cl-VSLS. In addition, the TOGA profiles over the NH mid-latitudes showed general enhancements in the Pacific basin compared to the Atlantic basin, with up to ?18 ppt difference for CH2Cl2 in the mid troposphere. We tagged regional source emissions of CH2Cl2 and C2Cl4 in the model and found that Asian emissions dominate the global distributions of these species both at the surface (950 hPa) and at high altitudes (150 hPa). Overall, our results confirm relatively high mixing ratios of Cl-VSLS in the UTLS region and show that the CESM model does a reasonable job of simulating their global abundance but we also note the uncertainties with Cl-VSLS emissions and active chlorine sources in the model. These findings will be used to validate future emission inventories and to investigate the fast convective transport of Cl-VSLS to the UTLS region and their impact on stratospheric ozone.","AI","University of Lancaster"

At this point, it is vital to perceive how materials are altered by various stimuli. To address this challenge, I conceptualise the following question: how can hydro-actuated systems become multi-responsive systems through combining bio-responsive mechanisms? To begin to imagine these actuators, I take inspiration from bio-inspired mechanisms to chart viable avenues/principles that can lead to scalable applications. Hydro-actuated facades can help decrease energy consumption in buildings because of the advantage of using bio-inspired materials and smart mechanisms derived from natural phenomena that occur on the scale of plants or animals. Most hydro-actuated facades are restricted in terms of their responses to a single stimulus, which makes them ineffective for building envelopes due to their inability to respond to other stimuli. The main aim of this study is to define challenges concerning hydro-actuated facades and develop principles to create a multi-stimuli-responsive system that senses and actuates passively. In this regard, by introducing a strategy of combining natural mechanisms in the context of architectural envelopes, this paper presents extra insight into the connection between building facades and environmental mechanisms.","AI","University of Lancaster"

During the post-monsoon seasons, the prevailing north-westerly winds are known to influence aerosol pollution events in Delhi by advecting pollutants from agricultural fires as well as from local sources. Here we investigate the year-round impact of meteorology on gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2). We use bottom-up NOx emission inventories (anthropogenic and fire) and high-resolution satellite measurement based tropospheric column NO2 (TCNO2) data, from S5P aboard TROPOMI, alongside a back-trajectory model (ROTRAJ) to investigate the balance of local and external sources influencing air pollution changes in Delhi, with a focus on different emissions sectors. Our analysis shows that accumulated emissions (i.e. integrated along the trajectory path, allowing for chemical loss) are highest under westerly, north-westerly and northerly flow during pre-monsoon (February–May) and post-monsoon (October–February) seasons. According to this analysis, during the pre-monsoon season, the highest accumulated satellite TCNO2 trajectories come from the east and north-west of Delhi. TCNO2 is elevated within Delhi and the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) to the east of city. The accumulated NOx emission trajectories indicate that the transport and industry sectors together account for more than 80 % of the total accumulated emissions, which are dominated by local sources (>70 %) under easterly winds and north-westerly winds. The high accumulated emissions estimated during the pre-monsoon season under north-westerly wind directions are likely to be driven by high NOx emissions locally and in nearby regions (since NOx lifetime is reduced and the boundary layer is relatively deeper in this season). During the post-monsoon season the highest accumulated satellite TCNO2 trajectories are advected from Punjab and Haryana, where satellite TCNO2 is elevated, indicating the potential for the long-range transport of agricultural burning emissions to Delhi. However, accumulated NOx emissions indicate local (70 %) emissions from the transport sector are the largest contributor to the total accumulated emissions. High local emissions, coupled with a relatively long NOx atmospheric lifetime and shallow boundary layer, aid the build-up of emissions locally and along the trajectory path. This indicates the possibility that fire emissions datasets may not capture emissions from agricultural waste burning in the north-west sufficiently to accurately quantify their influence on Delhi air quality (AQ). Analysis of daily ground-based NO2 observations indicates that high-pollution episodes (>90th percentile) occur predominantly in the post-monsoon season, and more than 75 % of high-pollution events are primarily caused by local sources. But there is also a considerable influence from non-local (30 %) emissions from the transport sector during the post-monsoon season. Overall, we find that in the post-monsoon season, there is substantial accumulation of high local NOx emissions from the transport sector (70 % of total emissions, 70 % local), alongside the import of NOx pollution into Delhi (30 % non-local). This work indicates that both high local NOx emissions from the transport sector and the advection of highly polluted air originating from outside Delhi are of concern for the population. As a result, air quality mitigation strategies need to be adopted not only in Delhi but in the surrounding regions to successfully control this issue. In addition, our analysis suggests that the largest benefits to Delhi NOx air quality would be seen with targeted reductions in emissions from the transport and agricultural waste burning sectors, particularly during the post-monsoon season.","AI","University of Lancaster"

While HAT, caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense or gambiense, has shown record low cases in recent years, the elimination of AAT remains difficult due to many complicating factors. One of these factors is the comparatively poor understanding of the main causative agent of AAT, Trypanosoma congolense. Both T. brucei and T. congolense possess a single flagellum that originates from inside the cell and exits through a membrane invagination called the flagellar pocket. The flagellar pocket and its associated structures are not only critical for parasite survival and virulence but also for coordinating the cell cycle. Improving our understanding of cell cycle regulation in these species could lead to novel drug targets, which could be aided by utilisation of a suitable synchronisation method. This project aims to optimise protocols for both the synchronisation and enrichment of flagellar pocket associated cytoskeletal structures (F-PACS) in African trypanosomes to provide opportunities for greater analysis of the cell cycle. To synchronise T. brucei, centrifugal counter-flow elutriation (CCE) was used to separate cells based on their hydrodynamic volume. Enriched fractions were collected containing >97% of cells in G1 in PCF, and >98% in BSF. Once returned to culture, this population continued to grow in a synchronous fashion. A protocol for enrichment of F-PACS in PCF T. brucei was optimised. Synchronised samples were generated for analysis of changes in phosphosite abundance across the cell cycle. Attempts were made to optimize mechanical and chemical synchronisation techniques for use on T. congolense, achieving a ~76% enrichment in G1 by CCE. This project provides useful optimisations for continued study of the cell cycle in trypanosomes. ","AI","University of Lancaster"

As single or multiple molecules serve as crucial building blocks for designing and constructing molecular electronic devices, comprehending their electronic and transport properties becomes imperative. Countless theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to create molecular junctions and explore their electrical performance. This thesis focuses on fundamental aspects of transport theory, employing theoretical and mathematical approaches to investigate electron transport through junctions, particularly involving a scattering region formed by a singlemolecule connected to metal electrodes. The research methods used are based on a combination of density functional theory, implemented within the SIESTA code, and non-equilibrium Green's function, realized using the GOLLUM code, to delve into electrical conductance on a molecular scale.The objective of this chapter is to address a puzzling paradox concerning metaconnectivity, which exhibits destructive quantum interference (DQI) in a tight binding model. However, in certain instances, DQI does not manifest in a DFT calculation on the same system. To shed light on this inconsistency, a selection of molecules is examined, focusing on the distinction between meta and para connectivity. Two different types of linkers, thiol (-SH) and methyl sulphide (-SMe), are employed to couple different molecules to Au electrodes. Through this investigation, we aim to gain insights into the underlying factors that lead to the observed quantum interferencebehaviors.In project two, we conducted a comprehensive study, combining experimental and theoretical approaches, to explore charge transport in stacked graphene-like dimers. Our findings revealed that the interaction between room-temperature quantum interference and stacking significantly influences their highly non-classical electrical conductance. Notably, for the molecule CQI-L, the electrical conductance of the dimer exceeds that of the monomer by a remarkable factor of 25, attributed to the most energetically favorable stacking interactions. Conversely, for the molecule CQI-H, the dimer's conductance is approximately 40 times lower than that of the monomer. These resultsunequivocally demonstrate that precise control of connectivity to molecular cores, coupled with stacking interactions between their systems, provides a versatile avenue for modifying and optimizing charge transfer between molecules. This discovery is expected to inspire further vigorous research at both macroscopic and microscopic levels.","AI","University of Lancaster"

There is a growing trend to deploy Cloud CDNs (CCDNs) to provide more flexibility compared to traditional CDNs. Today, regardless of the current technological advancements, most CCDNs still make their resource and cache management decisions while being unaware of what Content Providers (CPs) want to achieve. For instance, the APIs of prominent CCDNs (such as Amazon CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, and Microsoft Azure CDN) do not allow CPs to express their high-level targets, e.g., requests/region. Instead, CPs are mainly limited to specifying the desired geographical coverage and the origin content server. Fortunately, there has been an increasing interest in the Intent-Based Networking (IBN) paradigm, which aims to allow users to express what they want to do (in the form of an intent) instead of how to do it. By employing IBN, CCDNs could move towards a communication scheme that is more adaptive, flexible, and portable,that tries to automate meeting the CP’s intent target throughout the pre- and postdeployment phases of a service.In this thesis, we present a solution to enable such Intent-Based CCDN. Weillustrate how microservices modularity could be utilized in the intent translationprocess, decomposing intents into behavioral abstract policies that in turn gettranslated into technical realizations as microservices. This provides a more flexible, cost-effective, interoperable solution, and enables stakeholders to compare and alternate between microservice alternatives depending on the CP’s intent. We propose and implement a Low-Cost Intent (LCI) that targets cost reduction while provisioning a CCDN.We evaluate several realizations of this LCI, namely LCI1, LCI2 and LCI3 via selecting different microservice alternatives (i.e., leading to different overall CCDN deployments) for each. Additionally, we propose and implement different LCI refinement algorithms for performance improvement in various traffic scenarios. We conduct our evaluation experiments on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and test it using traces of real CDN traffic obtained from a major ISP. Evaluating our refined LCI different realizations against a baseline of GKE demonstrated the differences between these varying options. The best was LCI1 which reduced infrastructure cost by up to 10% in return for a 2% rise in dropped requests. On the other hand, although LCI2 also led to cost reduction up to 10%, it caused an increased request drops by almost 20%. Finally LCI3 led to the highest infrastructure cost reduction by up to 20% but in return for the highest rise in dropped requests by 40%. Interestingly, in a traffic bursts scenario, although the refined LCI resulted no cost reduction, it actually outperformed the baseline by reducing the amount of dropped requests by 30%. Accordingly, we discuss the factors that led to these different variations between the different LCI flavors based on their corresponding selected microservice alternatives.","AI","University of Lancaster"

This study aims to examine nitrogen-enriched novel biochar co-composts prepared from rice straw, maize stover, and gram residue in various mixing ratios of the biochar and their feedstock materials for the amelioration of acidic tropical soil. Three pristine biochar and six co-composts were prepared, characterized, and evaluated for improving the chemical and biological quality of the soil against a conventional lime treatment. The pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), calcium carbonate equivalence (CCE) and nitrogen content of co-composts varied between 7.78–8.86, 25.3–30.5 cmol (p               +) kg               −1, 25.5–30.5%, and 0.81–1.05%, respectively. The co-compost prepared from gram residue biochar mixed with maize stover at a 1:7 dry-weight ratio showed the highest rise in soil pH and CEC, giving an identical performance with the lime treatment and significantly better effect (p <.05) than the unamended control. Agglomerates of calcite and dolomite in biochar co-composts, and surface functional groups contributed to pH neutralization and increased CEC of the amended soil. The co-composts also significantly (p <.05) increased the dehydrogenase (1.87 µg TPF g                −1 soil h               −1), β-glucosidase (90 µg PNP g               −1 soil h               −1), and leucine amino peptidase (3.22 µmol MUC g               −1 soil h               −1) enzyme activities in the soil, thereby improving the soil’s biological quality.

J.","15/01/2024","The impacts of precipitation change on forest carbon (C) storage will have global consequences, as forests play a major role in sequestering anthropogenic CO . Although forest soils are one of the largest terrestrial C pools, there is great uncertainty around the response of forest soil organic carbon (SOC) to precipitation change, which limits our ability to predict future forest C storage. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effect of drought and irrigation experiments on SOC pools, plant C inputs and the soil environment based on 161 studies across 139 forest sites worldwide. Overall, forest SOC content was not affected by precipitation change, but both drought and irrigation altered plant C inputs and soil properties associated with SOC formation and storage. Drought may enhance SOC stability by altering soil aggregate fractions, but the effect of irrigation on SOC fractions remains unexplored. The apparent insensitivity of SOC to precipitation change can be explained by the short duration of most experiments and by biome-specific responses of C inputs and pools to drought or irrigation. Importantly, we demonstrate that SOC content is more likely to decline under irrigation at drier temperate sites, but that dry forests are currently underrepresented across experimental studies. Thus, our meta-analysis advances research into the impacts of precipitation change in forests by revealing important differences among forest biomes, which are likely linked to plant adaptation to extant conditions. We further demonstrate important knowledge gaps around how precipitation change will affect SOC stability, as too few studies currently consider distinct soil C pools. To accurately predict future SOC storage in forests, there is an urgent need for coordinated studies of different soil C pools and fractions across existing sites, as well as new experiments in underrepresented forest types.","AI","University of Lancaster"

No systematically constructed reviews were identified to explore the bereavement experience for people who are influenced by Chinese culture valuing filial piety and mutual dependence. This review aimed to systematically review the bereavement experience of Taiwanese family members living in Taiwan following an expected death. Methods: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, China Academic Journal Database, and Chinese Electronic Periodical Services were searched with no date restrictions from inception to 20 October 2022. The methodological rigour of studies was assessed using Hawker’s appraisal tool. A narrative synthesis approach using Popay’s work was employed to synthesise the findings of the studies. Studies investigating Taiwanese family members’ bereavement experiences were included. We excluded papers studying bereavement through the death of a child. Results: Searches retrieved 12,735 articles (after de-duplication), 17 of which met the inclusion criteria and were included for synthesis: English [9] and Chinese [8], published between 2006 and 2021. The studies varied in quality with scores ranging from 22 to 33 out of 36. The studies differed in the relationship between participants and the deceased, the bereaved time frames, and the definitions of bereavement. Most studies focussed on family members of cancer patients receiving specialist palliative care. Three bereavement theories and four tools were used. Risk factors of bereavement outcomes included family members feeling less prepared for death and deaths where palliative sedative therapy was used. Protective factors were higher caregiving burden and longer caregiving periods. Four themes regarding Taiwanese bereavement experience were generated: multiple impacts of death; problem-based coping strategies; importance of maintaining connections; influential religious beliefs and rituals. Conclusion: Continuing the relationship with the deceased is a key element of Taiwanese bereavement experience and it is influenced by religious and cultural beliefs. Suppressing or hiding emotions during bereavement to connect with the deceased and maintain harmonious relationships needs to be acknowledged as culturally acceptable and encouraged by some religions in Taiwan. The findings could be potentially relevant for other Chinese populations, predominantly Buddhist countries or other East Asian societies. The role of preparing for death in bereavement outcomes is little understood and requires further research.","AI","University of Lancaster"

However, as essential cultural institutions, libraries must strive to reflect both the contemporary era and the evolving reading habits of their audience. Comics, in this regard, could prove to be – and in part already are – a critical resource, a 'booster' for libraries.This article aims to provide a broad and introductory framework for understanding the relationship between comics and libraries in Italy. It will specifically examine the challenges and opportunities associated with this incomplete integration, addressing specific issues such as cataloging, displaying, managing, and promoting comics collections.The first section will explore the historical context of the troubled relationship between Italian libraries and comics, in line with crucial international studies.Following this historical contextualization, the second part will examine the challenges faced by Italian librarians in creating and managing comics collections, including the enduring perception of comics as a medium primarily for children.The research employs a multifaceted approach, combining bibliographic analysis, an anonymous survey, and data from a conference co-organized by the researcher. This research examines the Italian library system's fragmented approach to comics. It aims to understand librarians' perceptions of the medium and how they integrate comics into their collections.

Bariatric surgery is an available treatment for those living with a BMI (kg/m ) ≥40 and above, or ≥35 with obesity-related comorbidities. Guidelines highlight the importance of providing psychological support pre- and post-surgery owing to the complex psychopathology present in those living with obesity. There are a lack of studies examining which patients proceed to surgery and the factors that predict progression. Routine patient data were collected within one NHS regional service in the UK, comprising 733 patients between 3 August 2018 and 26 July 2019, aged between 17 and 76 years (M = 43.20, SD = 12.32). The only exclusion criteria were patients still awaiting a final decision for surgical outcome at the point of analysis (N = 29), which resulted in 704 patients included in analysis. Binary Logistic Regression revealed those who were more likely to progress to surgery had a lower-level use of maladaptive external substances; lower level of self-harm and/or suicidality, were older in age; had a lower BMI; and had less comorbidities than those who did not progress. Findings support existing literature in that bariatric patients often present with physical and mental health complexity. Two thirds of patients in this study did not progress to surgery. Service commissioning decisions meant that these patients did not have access to psychology treatment. Consequently, in cases where bariatric surgery is considered, a final treatment option and otherwise clinically appropriate, lack of access to specialist services may result in unmet patient need owing particularly to a lack of psychological treatment provision.

The study of surface water on these ice sheets, supraglacial hydrology, is essential to understand the effects of climate change on ice sheet stability, sea-level rise, and climate systems. This thesis examines supraglacial hydrological systems in Antarctica and Greenland by developing novel methods to classify them using optical satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8). Chapter 2 reveals the presence of supraglacial hydrology features, such as lakes and channels, on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet through a novel dual-NDWI and k-means clustering approach. A total of 10,478 features covering 119.4 km² were identified, broadening our knowledge of Antarctica's supraglacial hydrology. Chapter 3 uses random forest and radiative transfer models to analyse the extent and volume of surface meltwater on the Greenland Ice Sheet from 2014 to 2022. This study assesses supraglacial hydrological features Greenland wide, on a decadal scale, for the first time. The results imply that reductions in firn air content and increases in ice slab content are drivers of increasing meltwater in various drainage basins, particularly in the north, east, and south.Chapter 4 presents an innovative algorithm that quantifies uncertainty in the prediction of supraglacial hydrology using Bayesian inference with spatial statistics. This probabilistic approach provides predictions for the presence of water at the pixel level with associated standard deviations, which signify uncertainty. By quantifying uncertainty, this approach is important for understanding the quantity and trends of meltwater flowing into the ocean. This research advances our understanding of the distribution and dynamics of supraglacial hydrology on ice sheets, providing data and tools for the wider scientific community.

The MSOBC aims to modularise the battery units in the energy storage system of the EV to provide better safety and improved operation. This is mainly achieved by reducing the voltage of the battery packs without sacrificing the performance required by the HV system. The proposed MSOBC is an integrated OBC which can operate the EV during traction and braking, as well as charge the battery units. The MSOBC is composed of several submodules consisting of a full-bridge voltage source converter connected on the ac side and SEPIC converter installed on the battery side. The SEPIC converter controls the battery segments with a continuous current because it has an input inductor which can smooth the battery’s currents without the need for large electrolytic capacitors. The isolated version of the SEPIC converter is employed to enhance the system’s safety by providing galvanic isolation between the batteries and the ac output side. This paper presents the necessary control loops to ensure the optimal operation of the EV with the MSOBC in terms of charge and temperature balance without disturbing the required modes of operation.

Recruitment for online interviews occurred online, interviews were characterised by inaudible sounds, the inability to use video options and the challenges of including people with low income and education. We recommend that researchers critically evaluate the feasibility of online interviews within a particular African locality before fully implementing this data collection approach. Researchers may also collaborate with community-based organisations to help recruit a more socioeconomically diverse sample because of the potential of excluding participants with limited internet access.","AI","University of Lancaster"

It is often misunderstood by medical professionals and the public meaning stigma is regularly reported. The aim of this review was to synthesise the qualitative findings in the literature to develop a more in-depth understanding of how people with FND experience stigma to inform future interventions. This review used a meta-ethnography approach. Five databases were searched (PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) in February 2021 and updated in July 2022 for qualitative papers in FND. Included papers were critically assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) checklist. Data were analysed and synthesised utilising meta-ethnography. Sixteen papers were included in the final synthesis. Four major themes emerged: stigmatized by delegitimization; stigmatized by social exclusion and rejection; coping with stigma; and stigma and identity. The results identified negative, stigmatizing attitudes towards people experiencing FND symptoms in a variety of contexts including healthcare and other social institutions. The effects of stigma led to further exclusion for participants and appeared to trigger coping styles that led to additional difficulty. Stigma is a key part of the illness experience of FND and needs to be addressed.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONFunctional neurological disorders can cause a significant degree of disability for those individuals who experience them.This experience appears to be compounded by stigma these people encounter as a result of their illness in their day-to-day lives as well as in their contact with institutions including education, workplaces, and healthcare.A potential strategy to reduce the impact of stigma is through raising awareness of the reality of this condition which may be achieved through education targeted towards healthcare providers.","AI","University of Lancaster"

Cost-effectiveness models with long time horizons are commonly used to perform economic evaluations of diabetes’ treatments. As such, prediction accuracy and structural uncertainty are important features in cost-effectiveness models of chronic conditions. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review is to identify and review published cost-effectiveness models of diabetes treatments developed between 2011 and 2022 regarding their methodological characteristics. Further, it also appraises the quality of the methods used, and discusses opportunities for further methodological research. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase to identify peer-reviewed papers reporting cost-effectiveness models of diabetes treatments, with time horizons of more than 5 years, published in English between 1 January 2011 and 31 of December 2022. Screening, full-text inclusion, data extraction, quality assessment and data synthesis using narrative synthesis were performed. The Philips checklist was used for quality assessment of the included studies. The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021248999). Results: The literature search identified 30 studies presenting 29 unique cost-effectiveness models of type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes treatments. The review identified 26 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) models, 3 type 1 DM (T1DM) models and one model for both types of diabetes. Fifteen models were patient-level models, whereas 14 were at cohort level. Parameter uncertainty was assessed thoroughly in most of the models, whereas structural uncertainty was seldom addressed. All the models where validation was conducted performed well. The methodological quality of the models with respect to structure was high, whereas with respect to data modelling it was moderate. Conclusions: Models developed in the past 12 years for health economic evaluations of diabetes treatments are of high-quality and make use of advanced methods. However, further developments are needed to improve the statistical modelling component of cost-effectiveness models and to provide better assessment of structural uncertainty.","AI","University of Lancaster"

In order to guarantee good quality of a potential signal, it is crucial to reduce any backgrounds of Standard Model particles as much as possible. The dominant background downstream the beam dump is caused by muons [1].

E.; Armstrong, C. G.; Toghill, K. E.","1/01/2024","Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a topic of major interest in contemporary research as an approach to use renewably-derived electricity to synthesise useful hydrocarbons from waste CO2. Various strategies have been developed to optimise this challenging reaction at electrode interfaces, but to-date, decoupled electrolysis has not been demonstrated for the reduction of CO2. Decoupled electrolysis aims to use electrochemically-derived charged redox mediators – electrical charge and potential vectors – to separate catalytic product formation from the electrode surface. Utilising an electrochemically generated highly reducing redox mediator; chromium propanediamine tetraacetate, we report the first successful application of decoupled electrolysis to electrochemical CO2 reduction. A study of metals and metal composites found formate to be the most accessible product, with bismuth metal giving the highest selectivity. Copper, tin, gold, nickel and molybdenum carbide heterogeneous catalysts were also investigated, in which cases H2 was found to be the major product, with minor yields of two-electron CO2 reduction products. Subsequent optimisation of the bismuth catalyst achieved a high formate selectivity of 85%. This method represents a radical new approach to CO2 electrolysis, which may be coupled directly with renewable energy storage technology and green electricity.","AI","University of Lancaster"

A systematic search of online databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Evidence Search and Dynamed was conducted on 13th December 2021, and repeated on 30th October 2022, using appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Eligible studies reported the use of MA to determine hearing thresholds and compared results to conventional pure-tone audiometry (CA). Studies investigating MA for hearing screening (i.e. reporting just pass/fail) were ineligible for inclusion. Two authors independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Adults and children, with and without diagnosis of hearing impairment. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain the mean difference between thresholds measured using MA and CA in dB HL. Searches returned 858 articles. After systematic review, 17 articles including 1032 participants were analysed. The most used software application was Shoebox (6/17) followed by Hearing Test (3/17), then HearTest (2/17). Tablet computers were used in ten studies, smartphones in six, and a computer in one. The mean difference between MA and CA thresholds was 1.36 dB (95% CI, 0.07-2.66, p = 0.04). Significant differences between mobile audiometry (MA) and conventional audiometry (CA) thresholds were observed in thresholds measured at 500Hz, in children, when MA was conducted in a sound booth, and when MA was self-administered. However, these differences did not exceed the clinically significant threshold of 10 decibels (dB). Included studies exhibited high levels of heterogeneity, high risk of bias and low concerns about applicability. MA compares favourably to CA in measuring hearing thresholds and has role in providing access to hearing assessment in situations where CA is not available or feasible. Future studies should prioritize the integration of pure-tone threshold assessment with additional tests, such as Speech Recognition and Digits-in-Noise, for a more rounded evaluation of hearing ability, assesses acceptability and feasibility, and the cost-effectiveness of MA in non-specialist settings.

The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a fusion of advances in artificial intelligence, sensing techniques, data science, and other technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness in fast-growing markets. Although the EBW process can be monitored by characterisation of the electron beams before welding or using backscattered electron signals (BSE), the noise and lack of understanding of these signal patterns is a major obstacle to the development of a reliable, rapid and cost-effective process analysis and control methodology.In this thesis a controlled experiment was designed to be relevant to those industries and improve understanding of the relationship between beam and weld quality. The welding quality control starts before welding, continue throughout the welding process, and is completed with examination after welding. The same workflow was followed in this thesis, focusing on aforementioned QC stages, starting with beam probing experiments, followed by monitoring weld pool stability using high dynamic range camera and BSE signals, and ending with metallographic inspection on sections.The rapid development of computer vision methods brought an idea of classifying beam probing data before welding, which is first QC stage. Dataset of 3015 BeamAssure measurements was used in combination with deep learning, and various encoding methods such as Recurrence Plots (RP), Gramian Angular Fields (GAF), and Markov Transition Fields (MTF). The segmentation and classification results achieved a remarkable rate of 97.6% of accuracy in the classification task. This part of the work showed that use of time-series images enabled identification of the beam focus location before welding and providing recommended focus adjustment value.To replicate in-process QC step, titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) plates were welded with a gap opened in a stepwise manner, to simulate gap defects and introduce weld pool instability. Experiments were conducted to monitor the weld pool stability with a HDR camera and BSE detector designed for the need of this experiment. Signal and image analysis revealed occurrence of the weld defects and their locations, which was reflected by last QC stage, metallographic inspection on sections. This final part of the work proved that whatever method is used for gap defects monitoring, those joint misalignments can be easily registered by both methods. More interestingly, BSE monitoring allowed porosity and humping detection, which shapes and location were projected onto the BSE signal amplitude. Presented three stage QC method can contribute to a better understanding of beam probing and BSE signals patterns, providing a promising approach for quality assurance in EBW and could lead to higher weld integrity by improved process monitoring.","AI","University of Lancaster"

There are many difficulties in finding alternative cheap, scalable, and environmentally friendly end-of-life routes for carpet, as it is a long-lasting, hard-wearing composite material. The aim of this project, working together with Carpet Recycling UK (CRUK), was to explore the feasibility of various end-of-life routes for carpet in the UK. A literature review was conducted, analysing a variety of different routes for waste carpets and the merits and drawbacks of each, concluding that concrete reinforcement, sound insulation, and oil absorption are the three most promising areas, along with the production method of melt/electrospinning. Experimental work has been conducted on the separation of carpet fibres from backing using sink-float separation, the quantifying of these components with FTIR and DSC analysis, and the production of 3D printing filament. The filament produced by this was not of sufficient quality for further testing, potentially due to thermal degradation and/or contamination, and the report suggests ways in which higher quality filament could be produced. CO2e calculations have been made for a variety of different disposal routes to provide novel information on the CO2e impact of carpet disposal. This section shows that concrete reinforcement, equestrian surfacing, reuse and recycling are the least CO2e intensive end-of-life routes (0.063 tCO2e/tonne of carpet waste). The section also considered the impact of including a projected carbon offset, which reduces the apparent impact of EFW, kiln fuel, and concrete reinforcement (from 2.401 tCO2e/tonne to 0.548, -0.138, and -0.377 tCO2e/tonne respectively). Finally, landfill appears in CO2¬¬e impact as effectively neutral in impact, showing it may be a promising option for sequestering carpet waste until recycling technology improves.

In these diseases, TDP-43 is found aggregated in the cytoplasm of neurones in the brain and spinal cord and it is hypothesised that this aggregation leads to neuronal degeneration. Despite identification of TDP-43 as a constituent of pathological aggregates in 2006, progress in biochemical characterisation of TDP-43 and its aggregation has been limited by an inability to purify sufficient soluble protein to allow characterisation.  In this study, a novel method for the purification of TDP-43 has been developed. The resulting purified protein exists in multiple oligomeric states depending on buffer conditions, displays evidence of secondary structural content by circular dichroism spectroscopy and in preliminary studies demonstrates DNA binding activity. A TDP-43 C-terminal fragment was also purified and a fluorescence-based assay developed to monitor its aggregation, with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) used to image the aggregates produced. In this assay, small molecules were tested as aggregation inhibitors. Following minimal success re-purposing generic aggregation inhibitor molecules, a series of targeted peptide-based inhibitors were designed. The third-generation peptide inhibitors, designed with the aid of the artificial intelligence system AlphaFold, reduced the aggregation of the C-terminal fragment, with TEM identifying changes to the morphology of the aggregates produced. Finally, a “druggable” Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cell model of TDP-43 proteinopathy was developed, in which molecules with potential as TDP-43 aggregation inhibitors can be tested further.

These externalities can be mitigated by reducing cruising driving via operating book-ahead ride-hailing services, where the platform dispatches and routes drivers based on precise information on travelers’ departure time and origin–destination (OD). However, the effects of factors influencing book-ahead ride-hailing trips have rarely been empirically examined with real data. Using six-month trip data from China, this study employs a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method with hyperparameters optimized by the Bayesian optimization algorithm to examine the factors associated with book-ahead ride-hailing trips across OD pairs (hexagon cells-to-hexagon cells) at various spatial scales. The relative importance rankings generated from this study indicate that trip features, weather conditions, and accessibility to transportation hubs are significant determinants correlated with the usages of book-ahead ride-hailing. The partial dependence plots demonstrate the nonlinear threshold effects of these determinants on the hourly number of book-ahead ride-hailing per OD pair. Moreover, this study compares the differences in associations between peak and non-peak hours as well as weekdays and weekends.

This study showed that incident non-hip osteoporosis-related fractures are frequent among women aged 50 + in Portugal, leading to excessive healthcare costs of €74 million per year, in a conservative scenario. Purpose: This study aimed to estimate the costs of incident non-hip osteoporosis-related fractures among postmenopausal women living in Portugal from a payer perspective. Methods: The study includes women ≥ 50 years old who participated in the baseline assessment (2011–2013) and the first follow-up wave (2013–2015) of the Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases cohort, a Portuguese community-based longitudinal prospective study (n = 2,762). Incident non-hip osteoporosis-related fractures were defined as any self-reported low impact non-hip fractures since baseline. Healthcare resource utilization during the year following fracture was obtained from an informal panel of experts. The amounts of resources used were multiplied by the national tariffs practiced in the National Health Service (NHS) to obtain the cost per patient in the year following a wrist, vertebral, or other site fracture, which was subsequently multiplied by the estimated annual number of incident fractures to obtain the total annual cost of incident non-hip osteoporosis-related fractures among postmenopausal women. Results: Each year approximately 5,000 wrist, 3,500 vertebral, and 39,000 other-site osteoporosis-related fractures occur in women aged 50 + in Portugal. Healthcare costs per patient in the year following fracture vary from €2,709.52 for vertebral fractures to €3,096.35 for other fractures. Non-hip incident osteoporosis-related fractures among 50 + women cost approximately €74 million per year. Among all healthcare services, physiotherapy represents the bulk of costs. Conclusions: This study pinpoints the relevance of preventing non-hip osteoporosis-related fractures, as these cost about €74 million per year in direct healthcare costs, a substantial impact on the budget of the Portuguese NHS.","AI","University of Lancaster"

The reversal procedure is associated with a substantial morbidity up to 40%. Our previous research demonstrated that defunctioned ileum becomes atrophied, with extensive microbial dysbiosis. This study sought to investigate the potential influence of delaying ileostomy reversal surgery upon both clinical and pathological outcomes. Post-operative clinical data was recorded, including routine blood test results, duration of hospital stay, length of time with stoma and incidence of post-operative complications. We measured ileal fibrosis and atrophy and assessed whether these, or dysbiosis, were impacted by the length of time a stoma was in place, or were linked to clinical outcomes. Associations between clinical data were investigated using scatterplot matrix analysis and t-tests. We found no differences in time between ileostomy formation and reversal in patients experiencing complications vs. individuals with no complications. Furthermore, there were no correlations between days with stoma and pathological measures, such as atrophy or fibrosis, and no ongoing increases in collagen production at the time of reversal surgery. This data suggests that the length of time a stoma is in place does not impact on the likelihood of complications. The incidence of complications is associated with increased loss of microbiota in the defunctioned ileum, but importantly, the decrease in bacteria is not linked to time with stoma. Microbiota diversity in the functional and defunctioned limb correlated within an individual, and was not significantly different between those who experienced complications following surgery vs. those that didn't. Microbiota diversity was also not significantly impacted through delay (>365 days) in stoma reversal. We propose that methods to restore intestinal microbiota numbers, and not necessarily their composition, prior to reversal should be explored to improve the clinical outcomes of ileostomy reversal surgery.","AI","University of Lancaster"

Although handcrafted features provide rich expert knowledge, current fusion methods inadequately explore the relatively significant role of handcrafted features in conjunction with deep features, the imbalances in feature contributions, and the cooperative ways in which features learn. In this article, we propose a novel multifeature collaborative fusion network with deep supervision (MFCFNet) to effectively fuse handcrafted features and deep features for SAR ship classification tasks. Specifically, our framework mainly includes two types of feature extraction branches, a knowledge supervision and collaboration module (KSCM) and a feature fusion and contribution assignment module (FFCA). The former module improves the quality of the feature maps learned by each branch through auxiliary feature supervision and introduces a synergy loss to facilitate the interaction of information between deep features and handcrafted features. The latter module utilizes an attention mechanism to adaptively balance the importance among various features and assign the corresponding feature contributions to the total loss function based on the generated feature weights. We conducted extensive experimental and ablation studies on two public datasets, OpenSARShip-1.0 and FUSAR-Ship, and the results show that MFCFNet is effective and outperforms single deep feature and multifeature models based on previous internal FC layer and terminal FC layer fusion. Furthermore, our proposed MFCFNet exhibits better performance than the current state-of-the-art methods.","AI","University of Lancaster"

Several models have been proposed in the literature to deal with the optimum allocation of slots at a single airport. However, the literature currently does not adequately address the network-wide slot allocation problem. In this paper, we are introducing a novel approach to address the network-wide slot allocation problem. Our approach considers as an input the individual airport schedules generated during the slot allocation process at individual airports and optimally adjusts them to ensure network-wide flight connectivity by taking into account the interdependencies existing between flights connecting pairs of airports.To this end, we propose bi-objective mathematical models, which consider schedule efficiency and inter-airline fairness objectives, and incorporate the importance that different airports have for the functioning of the air transport network, using the IATA connectivity indices and the betweenness centrality measures. We solve the proposed models using the ε − constraint method to investigate trade-offs between network-wide schedule efficiency and fairness, and we investigate the effect of these trade-offs on the airlines and the airports. Results from the application of the proposed models to a test network suggest that the consideration of the contribution of the airports to network connectivity affect the way that the total network-wide schedule displacement is distributed among the airports. Specifically, we found that the use of the IATA connectivity index tends to allocate less schedule displacement to airports with frequent flights to many destinations, while the use of the betweenness centrality measure allocates less schedule displacement to airports that are more critical in ensuring the connectivity of other airports in the network.","AI","University of Lancaster"
"Refugees' and asylum seekers' experiences of individual psychological therapy: A qualitative meta‐synthesis","https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/refugees-and-asylum-seekers-experiences-of-individual-psychological-therapy(c88fb5ec-c5c1-485e-b2a0-7b1d87dbb76b).html","Hodge, S.; Duxbury, A.","31/12/2023","The current review aimed to synthesise qualitative literature exploring adult refugees' and asylum seekers' experiences of individual psychological therapy. A comprehensive systematic search of the following databases led to the identification of eight studies for inclusion in this review: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Academic Search Ultimate. All selected studies used qualitative methodology to explore refugees' and asylum seekers' experiences of individual psychological therapy. Studies were appraised using an adapted version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Tool. The data from these selected studies were then synthesised using a meta-ethnographic approach. The synthesis of selected studies resulted in the development of five themes; (i) the importance of recognition and validation within therapy, (ii) building a human connection within the therapeutic relationship and the importance of cultural competency, (iii) revisiting trauma, managing difficult emotions from therapy and regaining hope, (iv) the value of practical interventions, (v) 'one should not wake up the djinns (demons)'-cultural stigma and accessing therapy. These themes illustrated the complexities of working therapeutically with asylum seekers and refugees and the vital role of building trust and safety within the therapeutic relationship prior to engagement in therapeutic work. The results also highlighted varied responses to engaging in trauma work ranging from participants finding the experience transformative to others finding it unhelpful, some participants preferred more practical interventions. Participants' cultural backgrounds and pre-conceptions around therapy impacted on engagement and the therapist's cultural competency was a significant factor in therapeutic engagement. Working therapeutically with asylum seekers and refugees involves a number of factors for consideration. Forced migrants' socio-political context was seen as central to their experiences of distress and recognition of these factors was imperative for positive therapeutic engagement. This review highlights a number of clinical implications to guide practitioners working therapeutically with this community. [Abstract copyright: © 2023 The Authors.

N.","31/12/2023","Accurately quantifying rates of soil erosion requires capturing both the volumetric nature of the visible, convergent fluvial pathways (also known as rills) and the subtle nature of the less-visible, diffuse pathways (interrill areas). The aim of this study was to use Rare Earth Oxide (REO) tracers and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry to elucidate retrospective information about soil erosion rates and sediment sources during different soil erosion conditions, within a controlled laboratory environment. The experimental conditions created erosion events consistent with diffuse and convergent erosion processes. REO tracers allowed the sediment transport distances of over 2 m to be described, and helped resolved the relative contribution of diffuse and convergent soil erosion; interrill areas were also identified as a significant sediment sources soil loss under convergent erosion conditions. While the potential for SfM photogrammetry to resolve sub-millimetre elevations changes was demonstrated, under some conditions non-erosional changes in surface elevation, such as compaction, exceeded volumes of soil loss via diffuse erosion. The discrepancies between SfM Photogrammetry calculations and REO tagged sediment export were beneficial, identifying that during soil erosion events sediment in both aggregate and particle form is deposited within the convergent features, even when the rill extended the full length of the soil surface. The combination of SfM photogrammetry and REO tracers has provided a novel platform for building a spatial understanding of patterns of soil loss and source apportionment between rill and interrill erosion.","AI","University of Lancaster"

The analytic sample consisted of 10,838 adolescent respondents at age 14 (361 with intellectual disability and 10,477 without) and 9,408 adolescent respondents at age 17 (292 with intellectual disability and 9,116 without).ResultsParental reports of adolescent problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) indicated that adolescents with intellectual disability at ages 14 and 17 were more likely to have problems than those without intellectual disability across all SDQ domains. Adolescent self-report data at age 17 indicated that adolescents with intellectual disability were more likely to (self)-report that they had problems than those without intellectual disability on all but one SDQ domain. The magnitude of relative inequality between those with and without intellectual disability was consistently lower for self-report than parental report. On indicators of depression, mental well-being, self-harm, positive mental health, happiness and general psychological distress at ages 14 and 17, we found no self-reported group differences between adolescents with and without intellectual disability.ConclusionsFurther research is needed to understand: (1) why the magnitude of mental health inequalities between those with and without intellectual disability on the SDQ may be dependent on the identity of the informant; and (2) whether such differences are also apparent for other measures of mental health or well-being.","AI","University of Lancaster"

A sample of n = 209 young people enrolled in the 'Decades-to-Minutes' (D2M) study, based in Zurich, Switzerland, provided data from the ages of 7-20 via parent- and self-report questionnaires and ecological momentary assessment. Data were analyzed using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM). Worse student-teacher relationships predicted increased negative affectivity and emotional lability. Negative parenting practices predicted emotional lability only via their impact on student-teacher relationships. The findings point to worse student-teacher relationships as risk factors in the socioemotional development of children and young people.","AI","University of Lancaster"

In a context where the stabilization of AI as a figure enables further investments in associated techniques and technologies, AI's status as controversial works to reiterate both its ontological status and its agency. It follows that interventions into the field of AI controversies that fail to trouble and destabilise the figure of AI risk contributing to its uncontroversial reproduction. This is not to deny the proliferating data and compute-intensive techniques and technologies that travel under the sign of AI but rather to call for a keener focus on their locations, politics, material-semiotic specificity, and effects, including their ongoing enactment as a singular and controversial object.","AI","University of Lancaster"

M.; Milligan, A.","31/12/2023","The Rubin Observatory’s 10-yr Legacy Survey of Space and Time will observe near to 20 billion galaxies. For each galaxy the properties can be inferred. Approximately 105 galaxies observed per year will contain Type Ia supernovae (SNe), allowing SN host-galaxy properties to be calculated on a large scale. Measuring the properties of SN host galaxies serves two main purposes. The first is that there are known correlations between host galaxy type and SN type, which can be used to aid in the classification of SNe. Secondly, Type Ia SNe exhibit correlations between host-galaxy properties and the peak luminosities of the SNe, which has implications for their use as standardizable candles in cosmology. We have used simulations to quantify the improvement in host-galaxy stellar mass (M*) measurements when supplementing photometry from Rubin with spectroscopy from the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) instrument. We provide results in the form of expected uncertainties in M* for galaxies with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 and 18 &lt; rAB &lt; 25. We show that for galaxies mag 22 and brighter, combining Rubin and 4MOST data reduces the uncertainty measurements of galaxy M* by more than a factor of 2 compared with Rubin data alone. This applies for elliptical and Sc-type hosts. We demonstrate that the reduced uncertainties in M* lead to an improvement of 7 per cent in the precision of the ‘mass step’ correction. We expect our improved measurements of host-galaxy properties to aid in the photometric classification of SNe observed by Rubin.","AI","University of Lancaster"

To do so, it details on the methodology and results of a research project reconstructing the transnational impact of the collaborations between women producers and practitioners and UK broadcasters in the context of the UN Decade of Women (1975-1985). The investigation, funded by FIAT/IFTA (International Federation of Television Archives), analyses a group of programmes from the BFI archives by producing data-visualisations such as maps and network analysis generated through the collection of geographical, biographical, and chronological information. The goal of the study is offering a deeper understanding of transnationalism in the context of local television productions, while avoiding risks of fragmentation and methodological nationalism. However, while digital tools and data visualisations helped the identification of recurring tropes and transnational collaborations, the process of data collection and the visual aids themselves made evident the persistence of problematic geographies of knowledge and representation, that would require a broader assessment through collaborative, cross-national investigations.","AI","University of Lancaster"

Here, learning a new language is considered to offer new ways of describing, internalizing, and even perceiving the world. As learners accumulate experience with the second language (L2) for extended periods of time, their neurocognitive makeup evolves, like it does when learning new skills. Building on Benjamin Lee Whorf’s and Edward Sapir’s ideas introduced in the middle of the last century, the relationship between language and other cognitive processes is proposed to be dynamic in nature, following on logically from embodiment theory and the functional plasticity of the human brain. This chapter presents the theoretical basis for the idea that learning words and grammatical constructs can affect non-verbal cognition and reviews empirical evidence showcasing how learning an L2 can modulate the perception of colors, objects, and events.","AI","University of Lancaster"
