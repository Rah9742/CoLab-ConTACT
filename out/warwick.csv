"Joint multi-objective optimization for radio access network slicing using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/175499/","Zhou, Guorong; Zhao, Liqiang; Zheng, Gan; Xie, Zhijie; Song, Shenghui; Chen, Kwang-Cheng","September 2023","Radio access network (RAN) slices can provide various customized services for next-generation wireless networks. Thus, multiple performance metrics of different types of RAN slices need to be jointly optimized. However, existing efforts in multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) for RAN slicing are only in the scalar form, which is difficult to achieve simultaneous optimization. In this paper, we consider a non-scalar MOOP for RAN slicing with three types of slices, i.e. , the high-bandwidth slice, the low-delay slice, and the wide-coverage slice over the same underlying physical network. We jointly optimize the throughput, the transmission delay, and the coverage area by user-oriented dynamic virtual base stations (vBSs)' deployment, and sub-channel and power allocation. An improved multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, having the characteristics of centralized training and distributed execution, is proposed to solve the above non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem. The rank voting method is introduced in the inference process to obtain near-Pareto optimal solutions. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can ensure better performance than the traditional scalar utility method and other benchmark algorithms. The proposed scheme has the advantage of flexibly approaching any point of the Pareto boundary, while the traditional scalar method only subjectively approaches one of the Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, our proposal strikes a compelling tradeoff among three types of RAN slices due to the non-dominance between Pareto optimal solutions.","AI","Warwick University"
"Competition and misconduct.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/161759/","Thanassoulis, John","August 2023","Misconduct is widespread. Practices such as misselling, pump and dump, and money laundering cause harm while raising profits. This paper presents a mechanism that can determine what sorts of misconduct can be sustained in competitive equilibrium in concentrated markets, oligopoly settings, and markets with many small competing firms. The model studied allows general demand and distinguishes types of ethical dilemma using current psychological understanding. The paper shows, for example, that markets with many small competing firms are not vulnerable to misconduct if firms respond to entry with niche strategies or if the ethical dilemma draws an emotional response.","AI","Warwick University"
"Strategies for enhancing electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi-carbon fuels on copper.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/178888/","Li, Xin; Chen, Yuxin; Zhan, Xinyu; Xu, Yiwen; Hao, Leiduan; Xu, Liang; Li, Xueying; Umer, Muhammad; Tan, Xinyi; Han, Buxing; Robertson, Alex W.; Sun, Zhenyu","July 2023","Productively harnessing CO2 as a reactant is of practical interest due to addressing the dual pressures of resource sustainability and environmental sustainability. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) offers a promising approach for driving the chemical transformation of CO2 by exploiting green renewably generated electricity at (near) room temperature and ambient pressure, facilitating a sustainable, low-carbon footprint future. In this work, we provide a comprehensive and timely review of the various avenues that have been developed to date to modulate product selectivity, stability, and efficiency toward C2+ using Cu-based electrocatalysts. We discuss how the electrocatalyst structure can be effectively designed in order to boost performance. Special attention is paid to some of the critical intermediate species that shed light on CO2 reduction paths. We will also discuss the application of in situ and operando spectroscopy, along with computational techniques, that help to improve our fundamental understanding of ECR. Finally, development opportunities and challenge in the conversion of CO2 into multi-carbon fuels by Cu-based electrocatalysts are presented.","AI","Warwick University"

"Foucault as translator of Binswanger and von Weizsäcker.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/138694/","Elden, Stuart","March 2023","Foucault’s Introduction to a translation of Ludwig Binswanger’s essay ‘Dream and Existence’ was published in late 1954. The translation was credited to Jacqueline Verdeaux, with Foucault acknowledged for the notes. Yet Verdeaux herself indicates the intensely collaborative nature of their working process and the translation. In 1958, Victor von Weizsäcker’s Der Gestaltkreis was published in French as Le Cycle de la structure, translated by Foucault and Daniel Rocher. Foucault went on to translate and introduce Immanuel Kant’s Anthropology as his secondary doctoral thesis. His engagement with Kant and Binswanger’s ideas has been discussed in the literature, but his role as translator has generally been neglected. His engagement with von Weizsäcker is almost never mentioned. This article critically discusses Foucault’s role in the Binswanger and von Weizsäcker translations, comparing the German originals with the French texts, and showing how this is a useful additional element to the story of the early Foucault.","AI","Warwick University"
"A phenomenological model for electrical transport characteristics of MSM contacts based on GNS.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/173818/","Rahmani, Meisam; Ghafoorifard, Hassan; Ahmadi, Mohammad Taghi","January 2023","Graphene nanoscroll, because of attractive electronic, mechanical, thermoelectric and optoelectronics properties, is a suitable candidate for transistor and sensor applications. In this research, the electrical transport characteristics of high-performance field effect transistors based on graphene nanoscroll are studied in the framework of analytical modeling. To this end, the characterization of the proposed device is investigated by applying the analytical models of carrier concentration, quantum capacitance, surface potential, threshold voltage, subthreshold slope and drain induced barrier lowering. The analytical modeling starts with deriving carrier concentration and surface potential is modeled by adopting the model of quantum capacitance. The effects of quantum capacitance, oxide thickness, channel length, doping concentration, temperature and voltage are also taken into account in the proposed analytical models. To investigate the performance of the device, the current-voltage characteristics are also determined with respect to the carrier density and its kinetic energy. According to the obtained results, the surface potential value of front gate is higher than that of back side. It is noteworthy that channel length affects the position of minimum surface potential. The surface potential increases by increasing the drain-source voltage. The minimum potential increases as the value of quantum capacitance increases. Additionally, the minimum potential is symmetric for the symmetric structure (Vfg = Vbg). In addition, the threshold voltage increases by increasing the carrier concentration, temperature and oxide thickness. It is observable that the subthreshold slope gets closer to the ideal value of 60 mV/dec as the channel length increases. As oxide thickness increases the subthreshold slope also increases. For thinner gate oxide, the gate capacitance is larger while the gate has better control over the channel. The analytical results demonstrate a rational agreement with existing data in terms of trends and values.","AI","Warwick University"
"The skeleton of plasma turbulence : applications of nonlinear dynamical systems theory to a subcritical plasma turbulence model.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/182650/","Smith, Oliver Joel","January 2023","The formation of localised travelling structures in plasma turbulence is investigated through the application of dynamical systems methods novel to plasma physics contexts. These methods involve studying a plasma model by identifying model solutions known as relative periodic orbits (RPOs). RPOs are a generalisation of periodic solutions which allow for symmetries, and collectively form a ‘skeleton’ in phase space representing the set of solutions the system can approach and move between. Locating and categorising these RPOs and their overall structure in parameter space gives a new framework through which plasma turbulence can be analysed, allowing complex fully nonlinear structures to be identified and isolated, and the structure of turbulence to be better understood. This RPO-based approach has been applied in neutral fluid systems and has aided the understanding of similar bursty behaviour in contexts such as pipe flow [Pringle et al., Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 367, 457 (2009)] and Couette flow [Viswanath, D., J. Fluid Mech. 580, 339 (2007)].","AI","Warwick University"
"Cybersecurity in the automotive industry : a systematic literature review (SLR).","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/168110/","Fernandez de Arroyabe, Ignacio; Watson, Tim; Angelopoulou, Olga","April 2023","This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on cybersecurity in the automotive industry. Using the R tool Bibliometrix, a total of 537 papers related to cybersecurity and the automotive industry were analyzed. First, our paper contributes to academia by showing that research on this topic is grouped into four clusters that correspond to four lines of research: Automotive Security; Vehicle Engineering; Smart Vehicle; IT Security. Second, our paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the existing gaps. On the subject of standards and framework, there are gaps in terms of what the security requirements must be for the vehicle. This is very important since, given the heterogeneity of technology that vehicles from different manufacturers have, the cybersecurity requirements are different. Additionally, a gap can also be observed in the literature on the supply chain, which has a very small number of papers. In general, they do not cover or elaborate on the supply chain security, when, from a manufacturing point of view, it is very important to manage an effective cybersecurity strategy for the vehicles. Moreover, our paper also contributes to managers and policy-makers’ understanding of cybersecurity. We show that adequate implementation of cybersecurity in the automotive must involve a multidimensional perspective. First, it should be a multistage model, ranging from the first stages of design in interconnection with the suppliers to the final stages of use by the customer. Second, it should be a multi-level model, as a consequence of the interconnection of the vehicle’s control systems. Finally, the model should be multi-feedback, structuring the process design as a feedback system, including incident response, diagnosis services and vehicle updates.","AI","Warwick University"
"Space-time integral currents of bounded variation.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/169829/","Rindler, Filip","December 2022","Motivated by a recent model for elasto-plastic evolutions that are driven by the flow of dislocations, this work develops a theory of space-time integral currents with bounded variation in time, which enables a natural variational approach to the analysis of rate-independent geometric evolutions. Based on this, we further introduce the notion of Lipschitz deformation distance between integral currents, which arises physically as a (simplified) dissipation distance. Several results are obtained: A Helly-type compactness theorem, a deformation theorem, an isoperimetric inequality, and the equivalence of the convergence in deformation distance with the classical notion of weak* (or flat) convergence. Finally, we prove that the Lipschitz deformation distance agrees with the (integral) homogeneous Whitney flat metric for boundaryless currents. Physically, this means that two seemingly different ways to measure the dissipation actually coincide.","AI","Warwick University"
"A study of solar quasi-oscillatory signals.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/178940/","Mehta, Tishtrya","December 2022","We observe quasi-oscillatory behaviour frequently in solar data, for example in the quasi-biennial oscillation visible in magnetic activity proxies and quasi-periodic pulsations in flares. These behaviours have to be fully understood in order for our solar models to be complete. We can assess these behaviours using a host of analysis techniques that are capable of tracking the quasi-periodicities inherent in these data. In this thesis we use Empirical Mode Decomposition on helioseismic data to examine the quasi biennial oscillation and establish that there is a significant risk of spurious detections when used on short duration data. We also use a combination of the Fast Fourier Transform and Wavelet analysis to obtain the prevalence of non-stationarity in quasi-periodic pulsations using GOES data. We find that quasi-periodic behaviours are extremely common in solar data. We determine that the relative amplitude of the quasi-biennial oscillation is correlated with the amplitude of the solar cycle. We obtain evidence of low magnitude non-stationarity in the majority of quasi-periodic pulsations. Finally we conclude that understanding quasi-oscillatory behaviour is essential to form a complete understanding of the Sun, its dynamo, its magnetic field, and all associated behaviours.","AI","Warwick University"

To this end, the design and development of active and robust electrocatalysts is key. Here we report for the first time that incorporation of bismuth (Bi) single atoms on defective CuO could significantly enhance the ECR reaction to C2H4 by decreasing C–C coupling barriers. The overpotential for C2H4 production is lowered by at least 50 mV, along with a two-fold improvement in the faradaic efficiency, reaching 60% at 400 mA cm−2. The high performance is maintained even after 20 h of consecutive electrolysis. Control experiments along with density functional theory calculations suggest that the joint incorporation of Bi and oxygen vacancies greatly promotes CO2 adsorption and lowers C–C coupling energy barriers, thereby improving the C2H4 selectivity.","AI","Warwick University"
"Rigorous assessment of Cl−‐based anolytes on electrochemical ammonia synthesis.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/170258/","Lv, Zengxiang; Hao, Leiduan; Yao, Zhibo; Li, Weixiang; Robertson, Alex W.; Sun, Zhenyu","November 2022","Many challenges in the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia have been recognized with most effort focused on delineating false positives resulting from unidentified sources of nitrogen. However, the influence of oxidizing anolytes on the crossover and oxidization of ammonium during the electrolysis reaction remains unexplored. Here it is reported that the use of analytes containing halide ions (Cl− and Br−) can rapidly convert the ammonium into N2, which further intensifies the crossover of ammonium. Moreover, the extent of migration and oxidation of ammonium is found to be closely associated with external factors, such as applied potentials and the concentration of Cl−. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of oxidizing anolytes on the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia. Based on these results, many prior reported ammonia yield rates are calibrated. This work emphasizes the significance of avoiding selection of anolytes that can oxidize ammonium, which is believed to promote further progress in electrochemical nitrogen fixation.","AI","Warwick University"

This review is an introduction to the nature of white dwarfs, the physical processes that determine their structure and evolution, and the physical conditions they span. We discuss a wide variety of currently unsolved or partially resolved problems in their constitutive physics that are broadly related to equations of state, transport processes and opacities.","AI","Warwick University"
"Structure, entropy and evolution of systems of cities.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/176721/","Mazzamurro, Matteo","November 2022","One of the main questions in Urban Science is whether systems of cities around the world show similarities in their structure and trajectories of development. Shannon entropy has played a crucial role in this line of research, both because it is a versatile measure of uniformity and because of its ability to discriminate significant patterns from only seemingly organised maximum randomness. In this thesis, we present novel ways to analyse the structure of systems of cities and its evolution using entropy-based measures. We focus on key morphological aspects of a system of cities: the distribution of city sizes, their spatial arrangement, the population density and land use of their surroundings, and their connectivity via transport infrastructure; which we reconnect to human activities via spatial interaction models. We propose normalisation formulae for the first degree-based graph entropy that facilitate its interpretation as a measure of balance of the degree sequence of a network. We define a local entropy measure for raster data that quantifies the heterogeneity of a variable of interest in the surroundings of each cell. We define a measure of morphological polycentricity for historical systems of cities based on the entropy of the most likely potential interactions between the cities. We apply our methods to analyse systems of cities in different parts of the world and moments in history. We study the evolution of the entropy of city sizes in the main European powers from 1300 to 1850; the local entropy of land use and population density in Italy, the British Isles, and South Asia from 1700 to modern day; and the spatial organisation and morphological polycentricity of English and Welsh towns in the 19th century, via the entropy of spatial networks informed by the emerging railway system. Finally, we model the spatial-temporal dynamics of geo-tagged Tweets in London, of the Hungarian social network iWiW, and of the network of literary imitations between medieval Occitan troubadours.","AI","Warwick University"
"Classical vs. non-classical cyclometalated Pt(II) complexes.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/171043/","Maidich, Luca; Pilo, Maria I.; Rourke, Jonathan P.; Clarkson, Guy J.; Canu, Patrizia; Stoccoro, Sergio; Zucca, Antonio","October 2022","Rollover cyclometalated complexes constitute a family of derivatives which differ from classical cyclometalated species in certain aspects. Various potential application fields have been developed for both classes of compounds, which have both similarities and differences. In order to uncover the relationships and distinctions between these two families of compounds, four Pt(II) cyclometalated complexes derived from 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) and 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), assumed as prototypical ligands, were compared. For this study, an electron rich isostructural and isoelectronic pair of compounds, [Pt(N^C)Me(PPh3)], and an electron-poorer compound, [Pt(N^C)Cl(PPh3)] were chosen (N^C = ppy or bpy). DFT calculations, cyclic voltammetry, and UV-Vis spectra also helped to shed light into these species. Due to the presence of the more electronegative nitrogen in place of a C-H group, the rollover bpy-H ligand becomes a slightly weaker donor than the classical ppy-H ligand, and hence, generates (slightly) more stable cyclometalated complexes, lower energy frontier molecular orbitals, and electron-poorer platinum centers. On the whole, it was revealed that classical and rollover complexes have overall structural similarity, which contrasts to their somewhat different chemical behavior.","AI","Warwick University"

M.; Wood, Georgia F.; Houghton, Daniel; Walker, Marc; Han, Yisong; Zhao, Pei; Beanland, Richard; Macpherson, Julie V.","October 2022","The majority of carbon based transmission electron microscopy (TEM) platforms (grids) have a significant sp2 carbon component. Here, we report a top down fabrication technique for producing freestanding, robust, electron beam transparent and conductive sp3 carbon substrates from boron doped diamond (BDD) using an ion milling/polishing process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements reveal the sp3 carbon character and advantageous electrochemical properties of a BDD electrode are retained during the milling process. TEM diffraction studies show a dominant (110) crystallographic orientation. Compared with conventional carbon TEM films on metal supports, the BDD-TEM electrodes offer superior thermal, mechanical and electrochemical stability properties. For the latter, no carbon loss is observed over a wide electrochemical potential range (up to 1.80 V vs RHE) under prolonged testing times (5 h) in acid (comparable with accelerated stress testing protocols). This result also highlights the use of BDD as a corrosion free electrocatalyst TEM support for fundamental studies, and in practical energy conversion applications. High magnification TEM imaging demonstrates resolution of isolated, single atoms on the BDD-TEM electrode during electrodeposition, due to the low background electron scattering of the BDD surface. Given the high thermal conductivity and stability of the BDD-TEM electrodes, in situ monitoring of thermally induced morphological changes is also possible, shown here for the thermally induced crystallization of amorphous electrodeposited manganese oxide to the electrochemically active γ-phase.","AI","Warwick University"
"Dating apps : the uncertainty of marketised love.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/161961/","Bandinelli, Carolina; Gandini, Alessandro","September 2022","Dating apps promise a ‘digital fix’ to the ‘messy’ matter of love by means of datafication and algorithmic matching, realising a platformisation of romance commonly understood through notions of a market’s rationality and efficiency. Reflecting on the findings of a small-scale qualitative research on the use of dating apps among young adults in London, we problematise this view and argue that the specific form of marketisation articulated by dating apps is entrepreneurial in kind, whereby individuals act as brands facing the structural uncertainty of interacting with ‘quasi-strangers’. In so doing, we argue, dating app users enact a Luhmanian notion of interpersonal trust, built on the assessment of the risk of interacting with unfamiliar others that is typical of digitally mediated contexts dominated by reputational logics. From a sociocultural perspective, dating apps emerge as sociotechnical apparatuses that remediate the demand to rationally choose a partner while at the same time reproducing the (im)possibility of doing so. In this respect, far from offering a new form of efficiency, they (re)produce the ontological uncertainty (Illouz, 2019) that characterises lovers as entrepreneurs.","AI","Warwick University"
"Observational and statistical analysis of acoustic oscillations in the solar interior and the corona.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/178255/","Kosak, Mary K.","April 2024","Global solar oscillations below the acoustic cut-off frequency are trapped within the solar interior and become resonant. Signatures of these oscillations persist above the acoustic cut-off frequency, and these travelling waves are known as pseudomodes. Acoustic oscillation frequencies are known to be correlated with the solar cycle, but the pseudomode frequencies are predicted to vary in anti-phase. Therefore, pseudomodes can provide further insight into the Sun’s magnetic activity cycle. We analyze Global Oscillation Network (GONG) data covering two solar cycles (1996- 2017) by splitting them into overlapping 36-day long segments. The frequency shifts are then calculated via cross-correlating the segments’ power spectra. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the pseudomode frequency variations are in anti-phase with the solar cycle. Furthermore, the pseudomode frequency shifts show a double-peak feature at their maximum, which corresponds to solar activity minimum, and is not seen in the solar proxies. The auto-correlation was computed for the pseudomode range of 5600 − 8000μHz for GONG time series data from 1 January 2001 to 11 March 2021.","AI","Warwick University"

"Screening surface structure–electrochemical activity relationships of copper electrodes under CO2 electroreduction conditions.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/165899/","Wahab, Oluwasegun J.; Kang, Minkyung; Daviddi, Enrico; Walker, Marc; Unwin, Patrick R.","June 2022","Understanding how crystallographic orientation influences the electrocatalytic performance of metal catalysts can potentially advance the design of catalysts with improved efficiency. Although single crystal electrodes are typically used for such studies, the one-at-a-time preparation procedure limits the range of secondary crystallographic orientations that can be profiled. This work employs scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) together with co-located electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a screening technique to investigate how surface crystallographic orientations on polycrystalline copper (Cu) correlate to activity under CO2 electroreduction conditions. SECCM measures spatially resolved voltammetry on polycrystalline copper covering low overpotentials of CO2 conversion to intermediates, thereby screening the different activity from low-index facets where H2 evolution is dominant to high-index facets where more reaction intermediates are expected. This approach allows the acquisition of 2500 voltammograms on approximately 60 different Cu surface facets identified with EBSD. The results show that the order of activity is (111) < (100) < (110) among the Cu primary orientations. The collection of data over a wide range of secondary orientations leads to the construction of an “electrochemical–crystallographic stereographic triangle” that provides a broad comprehension of the trends among Cu secondary surface facets rarely studied in the literature, [particularly (941) and (741)], and clearly shows that the electroreduction activity scales with the step and kink density of these surfaces. This work also reveals that the electrochemical stripping of the passive layer that is naturally formed on Cu in air is strongly grain-dependent, and the relative ease of stripping on low-index facets follows the order of (100) > (111) > (110). This allows a procedure to be implemented, whereby the oxide is removed (to an electrochemically undetectable level) prior to the kinetic analyses of electroreduction activity. SECCM screening allows for the most active surfaces to be ranked and prompts in-depth follow-up studies.","AI","Warwick University"

We develop a multigrid approach to derive analytic expressions for the convergence rates of the algorithm for various widely used model structures, including nested and crossed random effects. Our results apply to multilevel models with an arbitrary number of layers in the hierarchy, while most previous work was limited to the two-level nested case. The theoretical results provide explicit and easy-to-implement guidelines to optimize practical implementations of the Gibbs Sampler, such as indications on which parametrization to choose (e.g. centred and non-centred), which constraint to impose to guarantee statistical identifiability, and which parameters to monitor in the diagnostic process. Simulations suggest that the results are informative also in the context of non-Gaussian distributions and more general MCMC schemes, such as gradient-based ones.","AI","Warwick University"

Sebeok’s name became all but synonymous with semiotics during the last half of the twentieth century. Sebeok located neglected semioticians in antiquity, and convinced many contemporary scholars that they were semioticians. One of his most fruitful encounters was with Juri Lotman of the Tartu–Moscow School of Semiotics, who had published in 1967 an ambitious model of human sign systems in which language would constitute a primary modeling system, and cultural phenomena a secondary modeling system. We inspect how Sebeok amended Lotman’s system, inserting another primary modeling system before language. This brings biological precursors to human language as a syntactic and learned faculty that builds on many nonsyntactic and sometimes nonconscious senses, including emotion, affect, and memory. We note how, in Sebeok’s final book in 2000 on modeling systems theory, co-authored with Marcel Danesi, there is a suggestion that the three layers of modeling systems may be colored by Peircean notions of firstness, secondness, and thirdness; we clarify how these layers are analogue. Finally, the fundamentals of the primary modeling system leak into languaging, as better understood through post-Sebeok cognitive and neurological sciences, and rendering less mysterious some of the strange effects of the COVID-19 pandemic’s proxemics crisis.","AI","Warwick University"

"Design of medical devices resilient to low-resource settings : from the regulatory framework to the actual design phase.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/168617/","Piaggio, Davide","October 2021","This thesis starts from a critical analysis of the current regulatory frameworks concerning medical devices and locations, criticising their non-universality and in-applicability to low-resource settings, and moves on to presenting the main challenges faced by low-resource settings, including the lack of maintenance, the poor supply chain, the scarcity of specialized healthcare professionals, the lack of maintenance, poor plants, low-quality and discontinuous power distribution, etc. In light of such challenges, the use of military standards, which allow a more context-aware approach, together with mHealth, 3D printing, protocycling, and a circular economy and frugal engineering approach are suggested as possible solutions. Subsequently, this thesis presents two original frameworks, namely one for assessing medical locations in low-resource settings which would allow a context-aware design, and one that comprises the criteria for designing medical devices resilient to such settings. Finally, it showcases five use cases, i.e., examples of designs of medical devices or parts of medical devices that were developed throughout my PhD project, following the frugal and contextual philosophy presented in this thesis.","AI","Warwick University"
"Heterologous expression and engineering of an industrially important macrolide biosynthetic pathway.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/167780/","Ho, Chi Hei Jack","August 2021","Produced by Streptomyces avermitilis, avermectin is an anthelminthic and insecticidal compound widely used in agriculture and medicine. The main motivation of this study was to bioengineer the terminal L-oleandrose sugar unit to access the industrially important semi-synthetic derivative of avermectin, emamectin. Currently, emamectin is produced by chemical derivatisation of avermectin which is extracted from large scale fermentation cultures of S. avermitilis. Through synthetic biology, we aimed to bypass the chemical modifications and create a fully biological process to produce emamectin. In this thesis, three main objectives were set: i) to sequence S. avermitilis with modern sequencing methods, ii) to express the avermectin BGC in a heterologous host, and iii) to engineer the L-oleandrose unit of avermectin to produce emamectin. Experiments in the laboratory established that the reference genome contained numerous indel and substitution errors. Through hybrid sequencing, we have obtained a genome of 99.9% accuracy with 46x coverage. Additionally, the sequence revealed 1.2 Mbp of the genome at the 3’ end not found in the 2003 reference genome. Genome mining by using antiSMASH revealed 11additional biosynthetic clusters. As genetic manipulation of S. avermitilis is very challenging compared to other more genetically tractable Streptomyces bacteria such as Streptomyces coelicolor, we integrated a bacterial artificial chromosome pESAC13A 16K, which contains the avermectin BGC, into S. coelicolor M1152 and heterologously produced avermectin as revealed by LC-MS analyses. We identified candidate aminotransferases and methyltransferases that may carry out the target reactions on the L-oleandrose sugar unit. A combinatorial Golden Gate cloning approach was developed to test out different combinations of aminotransferases and methyltransferases for expression in S. coelicolor M1152  long with the avermectin cluster. LC-MS analyses did not show conclusive results on the activities of the aminotransferases and methyltransferases. Whilst the production of emamectin using a fully biological process was not achieved in the time-frame of this project, the work reported and discussed lay the foundations for this enterprise to be achieved in the longer term.","AI","Warwick University"
"A parametric approach to hereditary classes.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/163771/","Alecu, Bogdan","June 2021","The “minimal class approach"" consists of studying downwards-closed properties of hereditary graph classes (such as boundedness of a certain parameter within the class) by identifying the minimal obstructions to those properties. In this thesis, we look at various hereditary classes through this lens. In practice, this often amounts to analysing the structure of those classes by characterising boundedness of certain graph parameters within them. However, there is more to it than this: while adopting the minimal class viewpoint, we encounter a variety of interesting notions and problems { some more loosely related to the approach than others.

"Inscribing Flavian Rome : epigraphic strategies in Martial’s epigrams.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/162322/","Tafaro, Alessandra","April 2021","This thesis explores Martial’s dynamic engagement with Roman epigraphic culture and interrogates how the poet rethinks the paradoxes of poetic monumentality through the lens of textual materiality. It examines the nature, functioning and critical consequences of the relationship between literary epigrams and epigraphic texts, advancing our understanding of the production, consumption and circulation of poetry across different media. The thesis investigates epigraphic strategies in Martial’s corpus, including the construction of anonymous readerships as travellers passing by epitaphs inscribed upon tombs and the power of epigrams and inscriptions to transform the ideological connotations of monumental spaces in the context of damnatio memoriae. By pursuing a close comparative analysis of literary epigrams and a range of Roman writing habits, i.e., monumental inscriptions, epitaphs and graffiti, which Martial identifies with scrawls on walls in chalk or charcoal or with texts neatly incised in stone, the thesis investigates key concerns about literary materiality and monumentality, authorship and plagiarism, parallel techniques of intertextual allusions and the construction of urban spaces which characterise both literary and epigraphic contexts. By combining perspectives deriving both from literature and material culture, this study reconsiders epigrammatic poetry and epigraphic writing as complementary cultural activities which involve not only thematic and generic interactions, but also intersecting audiences and interconnected socio-cultural phenomena. As well as analysing central concerns of Martial’s epigraphic strategies, the thesis explores what changes when we interpret Roman epigrammatic poetry and epigraphic habits in dialogue with one another. At the juncture between literary criticism and studies in material culture, this project offers insights into the distinctiveness of Martial’s poetry and re-considers the value of epigraphic texts as central to the understanding of early imperial writing culture.","AI","Warwick University"
"Fluxing behaviour : reactions between iron ore and fluxing agents in the cyclone converter furnace of Hlsarna.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/169291/","Whiston, James","April 2021","Steel is under increasing pressure from governments and environmental groups to cut CO2 emissions. To fight this, a number of alternative ironmaking processes have been devised to replace the blast furnace (BF) ironmaking process in modern integrated steel plants. The blast furnace has been targeted, as it is the highest producer of greenhouse gases in the steel plant. This is due to the high use of coal as an active ingredient and the energy intensive processing of raw materials for use in the furnace such as coking ovens and sintering. Tata Steel Europe have been developing an alternative iron making plant called HIsarna that is a combination of two technologies: cyclone converter furnace and HIsmelt smelting reduction vessel. The trials have shown that the process can cut CO2 emissions drastically compared to the current BF ironmaking and has greater flexibility in the raw materials and energy used for the process.","AI","Warwick University"
"Electrochemical and spectro-electrochemical investigation of metal electrodeposition.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/153557/","Borrill, Alexandra ","November 2020","Metals and metal ions are of great importance to our health and environment as well as having a range of technological applications. Many metals and metal ions are toxic, some even at extremely low concentrations such as Hg, whilst others are required for biological function such as Fe and Cu. As metals in different forms are prevalent in our environment it is important to have cheap, fast and reliable methods of analysing them down to the ppb level. Electrochemistry is a powerful tool for analysis and fundamental investigations due to its flexibility, sensitivity and relatively low cost. Electrochemical methods can be easily coupled with other techniques such as spectroscopy or microscopy to add a new dimension to the analysis, such as with electrochemical x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EC-XRF). Here the metal is pre-concentrated on an electrode surface by electrodeposition and then chemically interrogated using XRF. Previous EC-XRF studies have suffered from cumbersome set-ups, preventing progress to commercially viable systems. In this thesis, the coupling of different mass transport systems to different more user-friendly set-ups is explored for both in situ and ex situ EC-XRF methodologies.","AI","Warwick University"

Prior research has been largely correlational in design. This paper describes a rigorous and comprehensive review of international evidence, synthesising the findings of some of the strongest empirical work so far. Methods: The review synthesises a total of 120 pieces of research from 13 electronic databases, Google/Google scholar and other sources. Each study is weighted by strength of evidence. Results: The strongest evidence suggests that targeted money can encourage people into teaching but does not necessarily keep them in the teaching profession. The money needs to be large enough to compensate for the disadvantages of working in certain schools and areas, and competitive enough to offset the opportunity costs of not being in more lucrative occupations, and its effect is only short-term. Conclusions: Continuing professional development (CPD) and early career support could be promising approaches for retaining teachers in the profession, but the evidence for them is weak. There is no evidence that any other approaches work, largely because of the lack of robust studies.","AI","Warwick University"

"Changes in phenological events in response to a global warming scenario reveal greater adaptability of winter annual compared to summer annual Arabidopsis ecotypes.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/140129/","Footitt, Steven; Hambidge, Angela J.; Finch-Savage, William E.","April 2010","Background and Aims The impact of global warming on life cycle timing is uncertain. We investigated changes in life cycle timing in a global warming scenario. We compared Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes adapted to the warm/dry Cape Verdi Islands (Cvi), Macaronesia, and the cool/wet climate of the Burren (Bur), Ireland, Northern Europe. These are obligate winter and summer annuals respectively. Methods Using a global warming scenario predicting a 4°C temperature rise from 2011 to circa 2080 we produced F1 seeds at each end of a thermogradient tunnel. Each F1 cohort (cool and warm) then produced F2 seeds at both ends of the thermal gradient in winter and summer annual life cycles. F2 seeds from the winter life cycle were buried at three positions along the gradient to determine the impact of temperature on seedling emergence in a simulated winter life cycle. Key Results In a winter life cycle, increasing temperatures advanced flowering time by 10.1 days °C-1 in the winter annual and 4.9 days °C-1 in the summer annual. Plant size and seed yield responded positively to global warming in both ecotypes. In a winter life cycle, the impact of increasing temperature on seedling emergence timing was positive in the winter annual, but negative in the summer annual. Global warming reduced summer annual plant size and seed yield in a summer life cycle. Conclusions Seedling emergence timing observed in the north European summer annual ecotype may exacerbate the negative impact of predicted increased spring and summer temperatures on their establishment and reproductive performance. In contrast, seedling establishment of the Macaronesian winter annual may benefit from higher soil temperatures that will delay emergence until autumn, but which also facilitates earlier spring flowering and consequent avoidance of high summer temperatures. Such plasticity gives winter annual Arabidopsis ecotypes a distinct advantage over summer annuals in expected global warming scenarios. This highlights the importance of variation in the timing of seedling establishment in understanding plant species responses to Anthropogenic Climate Change.","AI","Warwick University"
"The host galaxies and progenitors of core-collapse gamma-ray bursts.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/152465/","Chrimes, Ashley","March 2020","Ever since their discovery over 50 years ago, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been the subject of intense interest in transient astronomy. Despite being extremely luminous, their distance and transient nature have made studies challenging. By investigating their galactic environments, lightcurves and spectra, a consensus has arisen that long-duration (> 2s) GRBs are highly beamed relativistic explosions, arising from the collapse of massive, fast-spinning, stripped-envelope stars. However, the exact nature of their central engines and progenitor systems remain mysterious, not least due to the variety of environments they inhabit. The challenge is to explain all of the observed properties of long GRBs and their host galaxies simultaneously. In this thesis, I present multi-wavelength observational studies of unusual GRB host galaxies, the hosts of unusual GRBs, and a theoretical investigation into the progenitor systems of long GRBs using binary population synthesis techniques.","AI","Warwick University"
"Deep learning for electrocardiogram analysis applied to health monitoring applications.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/151189/","Porumb, Mihaela","February 2020","Several recent advances fuelled the significant increase in interest for Artificial Intelligence-based healthcare innovations: the vast availability of biomedical data, accurate wearable sensors, electronic health records, the advancement in Machine Learning methods and affordable computational resources. This thesis focuses on electrocardiogram signal analysis using a range of deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Autoencoders for developing several health monitoring applications. The performance of the proposed models was investigated in two applications (i.e. nocturnal low glucose detection and congestive heart failure diagnosis), that share the same aspects of the input data including noise, time-dependence, heterogeneity. This thesis explores the efficacy of a personalised deep learning-based system for the automatic detection of low glucose levels in real-life settings, overcoming the limitations of previous attempts. Furthermore, this thesis explores unsupervised methods for learning time series representations to address the high cost and scarcity of the labelled biomedical data. A novel deep learning-based method that employed raw electrocardiogram signals was explored for congestive heart failure diagnosis. Added to their superior performance, the results presented in this thesis bring forward the intuition that short electrocardiogram recordings, of just about 5 minutes, can be sufficient to diagnose correctly severe congestive heart failure. A third case study presented in this thesis advances the idea that certain heart rate variability features can be estimated from a short (≈ 1 minute) raw electrocardiogram signal, which might facilitate the development of real-time applications.","AI","Warwick University"
"Binary population synthesis models for core-collapse gamma-ray burst progenitors.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/129871/","Chrimes, Ashley; Stanway, Elizabeth R.; Eldridge, J. J.","January 2020","Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are understood to be the final fate for a subset of massive, stripped envelope, rapidly rotating stars. Beyond this, our knowledge of the progenitor systems is limited. Using the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis) stellar evolution models, we investigate the possibility that some massive stars in binaries can maintain the angular momentum required for jet production, while still loosing their outer envelope through winds or binary interactions. We find that a total hydrogen mass of less than 0.0005 Msun and a helium ejecta mass fraction of less than 0.20 provide the best thresholds for the supernova type II/Ibc and Ib/Ic divisions respectively. Tidal interactions in binaries are accounted for by applying a tidal algorithm to post-process the stellar evolution models output by BPASS. We show that the observed volumetric gamma-ray burst rate evolution can be recreated using two distinct pathways and plausible distributions for burst parameters. In the first pathway, stars are spun up by mass accretion into a quasi-homogeneous state. In the second, tides maintain rotation where otherwise the star would spin down. Both lead to type Ic supernova progenitors, and a metallicity distribution consistent with the GRB host galaxy population. The inferred core angular momentum threshold for jet production is consistent with theoretical requirements for collapsars, given the assumptions made in our model. We can therefore reproduce several aspects of core collapse supernova/GRB observation and theory simultaneously. We discuss the predicted observable properties of GRB progenitors and their surviving companions.","AI","Warwick University"

However, in practical communication scenarios, transceiver architectures inevitably suffer from radio frequency (RF) front-end related impairments that cause non-negligible performance degradation. This issue can be addressed by analog and digital signal processing algorithms, however, inevitable aspects of this approach such as time-varying hardware characteristics and imperfect compensation schemes result to detrimental residual distortions. In the present contribution we investigate the physical layer security of NOMA-based amplify-and-forward relay systems under such realistically incurred residual hardware impairment (RHI) effects. Exact and asymptotic analytic expressions for the corresponding outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) of the considered setup over multipath fading channels are derived and corroborated by respective simulation results. Based on this, it is shown that RHI affects both the legitimate users and eavesdroppers by increasing the OP and decreasing the IP. For a fixed OP, RHI generally increases the corresponding IP, thereby reducing the secure performance of the system. Further interesting insights are provided, verifying the importance of the offered results for the effective design and deployment of secure cooperative communication systems.","AI","Warwick University"

A global report of the monthly activity of these viruses is needed to inform public health strategies and programmes for their control.Methods:In this systematic analysis, we compiled data from a systematic literature review of studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017; online datasets; and unpublished research data. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported laboratory-confirmed incidence data of human infection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or metapneumovirus, or a combination of these, for at least 12 consecutive months (or 52 weeks equivalent); stable testing practice throughout all years reported; virus results among residents in well-defined geographical locations; and aggregated virus results at least on a monthly basis. Data were extracted through a three-stage process, from which we calculated monthly annual average percentage (AAP) as the relative strength of virus activity. We defined duration of epidemics as the minimum number of months to account for 75% of annual positive samples, with each component month defined as an epidemic month. Furthermore, we modelled monthly AAP of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using site-specific temperature and relative humidity for the prediction of local average epidemic months. We also predicted global epidemic months of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus on a 5° by 5° grid. The systematic review in this study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091628.Findings:We initally identified 37 335 eligible studies. Of 21 065 studies remaining after exclusion of duplicates, 1081 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 185 were identified as eligible. We included 246 sites for influenza virus, 183 sites for respiratory syncytial virus, 83 sites for parainfluenza virus, and 65 sites for metapneumovirus. Influenza virus had clear seasonal epidemics in winter months in most temperate sites but timing of epidemics was more variable and less seasonal with decreasing distance from the equator. Unlike influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus had clear seasonal epidemics in both temperate and tropical regions, starting in late summer months in the tropics of each hemisphere, reaching most temperate sites in winter months. In most temperate sites, influenza virus epidemics occurred later than respiratory syncytial virus (by 0·3 months [95% CI −0·3 to 0·9]) while no clear temporal order was observed in the tropics. Parainfluenza virus epidemics were found mostly in spring and early summer months in each hemisphere. Metapneumovirus epidemics occurred in late winter and spring in most temperate sites but the timing of epidemics was more diverse in the tropics. Influenza virus epidemics had shorter duration (3·8 months [3·6 to 4·0]) in temperate sites and longer duration (5·2 months [4·9 to 5·5]) in the tropics. Duration of epidemics was similar across all sites for respiratory syncytial virus (4·6 months [4·3 to 4·8]), as it was for metapneumovirus (4·8 months [4·4 to 5·1]). By comparison, parainfluenza virus had longer duration of epidemics (6·3 months [6·0 to 6·7]). Our model had good predictability in the average epidemic months of influenza virus in temperate regions and respiratory syncytial virus in both temperate and tropical regions. Through leave-one-out cross validation, the overall prediction error in the onset of epidemics was within 1 month (influenza virus −0·2 months [−0·6 to 0·1]; respiratory syncytial virus 0·1 months [−0·2 to 0·4]).Interpretation:This study is the first to provide global representations of month-by-month activity of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus. Our model is helpful in predicting the local onset month of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics. The seasonality information has important implications for health services planning, the timing of respiratory syncytial virus passive prophylaxis, and the strategy of influenza virus and future respiratory syncytial virus vaccination.","AI","Warwick University"

These authors include Valérie Zenatti, Slimane Benaïssa, André Chouraqui, Hubert Haddad, and Yasmina Khadra. The disciplinary framework combines (Francophone) postcolonial studies, Jewish studies, and memory studies in considering the traumatic legacies of genocide and colonialism which together form an historical backdrop to the Arab-Israeli conflict as depicted in the primary texts. By focusing on the 1990s to the present day, the thesis looks at fictional responses to the breakdown of the so-called peace process, revealing tentative spaces for dialogue and re-evaluation within the texts which allow for unsettling memories to be negotiated. In relation to the authors’ own trajectories as well as their works of fiction, the thesis explores alternative identities to the Arab versus Jew and Israeli versus Palestinian antagonisms. Indeed, the thesis highlights the flimsiness of identity binaries between Arab, Jew, Palestinian, and Israeli identities, which are in tension with rather than in opposition to one another, steeped as they are in interrelated traumatic pasts. Moreover, the thesis draws on the concepts of filiation (roots) and affiliation (connections), demonstrating the dialogic potential of the primary texts, which resist utopian endings but dare to imagine an alternative future of peaceful coexistence.","AI","Warwick University"

We describe an approach whereby electrocatalysis at a small number of well-defined mass-selected Pt NCs (Pt923±37, diameter, d ≈ 3 nm) deposited from a cluster beam source on carbon-coated TEM grids, can be measured by a scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) setup, in tandem with a range of complementary microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. The SECCM set up delivers high mass transport rates and allows the effects of transient reactive intermediates to be elucidated for different Pt surface coverage (NC spacing). A major observation is that the ORR activity decreases during successive electrochemical (voltammetric) measurements. This is shown to be due to poisoning of the Pt NCs by carbon/oxygen containing moieties that are produced by the reaction of reactive oxygen intermediates (RIs), generated by ORR, with the carbon support. The effect is most prominent when the Pt surface coverage on the carbon support is low (< 6%). Furthermore, the NC deposition impact energy affects drastically the resulting Pt NC stability during electrochemistry. For lower impact energy, Pt NCs migrate as a consequence of the ORR and are rearranged in characteristic groups on the support. This previously unseen effect is caused by an uneven flux distribution around individual NCs within the ensemble and has important consequences for understanding the stability and activity of NC and nanoparticle arrays.","AI","Warwick University"

Upon ovulation, progesterone and rising cellular cAMP levels activate the transcription factor Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs), leading to cell cycle exit and differentiation into decidual cells that control embryo implantation. Here we show that FOXO1 also causes acute senescence of a subpopulation of decidualizing EnSCs in an IL-8 dependent manner. Selective depletion or enrichment of this subpopulation revealed that decidual senescence drives the transient inflammatory response associated with endometrial receptivity. Further, senescent cells prevent differentiation of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells in decidualizing cultures. As the cycle progresses, IL-15 activated uterine natural killer (uNK) cells selectively target and clear senescent decidual cells through granule exocytosis. Our findings reveal that acute decidual senescence governs endometrial rejuvenation and remodeling at embryo implantation, and suggest a critical role for uNK cells in maintaining homeostasis in cycling endometrium.","AI","Warwick University"
"Gibbs measures of nonlinear Schrödinger equations as limits of quantum many-body states in dimensions d <=3.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/92889/","Fröhlich, Jürg; Knowles, Antti; Schlein, Benjamin; Sohinger, Vedran","December 2017","We prove that Gibbs measures of nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations arise as high-temperature limits of thermal states in many-body quantum mechanics. Our results hold for defocusing interactionsin dimensions d = 1, 2, 3. The many-body quantum thermal states that we consider are the grand canonical ensemble for d = 1 and an appropriate modification of the grand canonical ensemble for d = 2, 3. In dimensions d = 2, 3, the Gibbs measures are supported on singular distributions, and a renormalization of the chemical potential is necessary. On the many-body quantum side, the need for renormalization is manifested by a rapid growth of the number of particles. We relate the original many-body quantum problem to a renormalized version obtained by solving a counterterm problem. Our proof is based on ideas from field theory, using a perturbative expansion in the interaction, organized by using a diagrammatic representation, and on Borel resummation of the resulting series.","AI","Warwick University"

Our result implies stability for unstable Quillen K-groups and proves a conjecture of Bass. For commutative local rings with infinite residue fields, we show that the obstruction to further stability is given by Milnor-Witt K-theory. As an application we construct Euler classes of projective modules with values in the cohomology of the Milnor-Witt K-theory sheaf. For d-dimensional commutative noetherian rings with infinite residue fields we show that the vanishing of the Euler class is necessary and sufficient for an oriented projective module P of rank d to split off a rank 1 free direct summand. Along the way we obtain a new presentation of Milnor-Witt K-theory and of symplectic K2 simplifying the classical Matsumoto-Moore presentation.","AI","Warwick University"

P.","October 2017","The black hole (BH) binary V404 Cyg entered the outburst phase in 2015 June after 26 yr of X-ray quiescence, and with its behaviour broke the outburst evolution pattern typical of most BH binaries. We observed the entire outburst with the Swift satellite and performed time-resolved spectroscopy of its most active phase, obtaining over a thousand spectra with exposures from tens to hundreds of seconds. All the spectra can be fitted with an absorbed power-law model, which most of the time required the presence of a partial covering. A blueshifted iron-Kα line appears in 10 per cent of the spectra together with the signature of high column densities, and about 20 per cent of the spectra seem to show signatures of reflection. None of the spectra showed the unambiguous presence of soft disc–blackbody emission, while the observed bolometric flux exceeded the Eddington value in 3 per cent of the spectra. Our results can be explained assuming that the inner part of the accretion flow is inflated into a slim disc that both hides the innermost (and brightest) regions of the flow, and produces a cold, clumpy, high-density outflow that introduces the high absorption and fast spectral variability observed. We argue that the BH in V404 Cyg might have been accreting erratically or even continuously at Eddington/super-Eddington rates – thus sustaining a surrounding slim disc – while being partly or completely obscured by the inflated disc and its outflow. Hence, the largest flares produced by the source might not be accretion-driven events, but instead the effects of the unveiling of the extremely bright source hidden within the system.","AI","Warwick University"
"A discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for quasi-geostrophic frontogenesis.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/102632/","Lindley, Jorge Vicente Malik","August 2017","In this thesis, a mixed continuous and discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is developed for the three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic equations, and is used to investigate the role that weather front formation plays in the transfer of energy to small scales that would produce a k. 5=3   energy spectrum as observed in the atmosphere. The quasi-geostrophic equations are used for computational efficiency and   are found to be sufficient for producing simple fronts. Discontinuous Galerkin finite elements are used for the potential vorticity as continuous Galerkin methods perform   poorly with advection dominated problems. The less dynamical vertical direction is discretised with finite difference to simplify the finite element method in the horizontal. Streamfunction boundary values are derived for free-slip boundary conditions in the three-dimensional model. The scheme is verified with numerical tests   and is shown to converge at optimal rates until free-slip boundaries are introduced. Conservation of energy and enstrophy are shown numerically. Using the numerical   method, a channel model simulation suggests that the bend up of fronts produced   by a meandering zonal jet could be a viable mechanism for producing a k.5=3   regime.","AI","Warwick University"

But, how do values form and what causes them to change? This paper proposes a theory of value formation. In the model, agents choose values, motivated by economic considerations and, crucially, also by the desire for esteem. The comparative statics are driven by the following tension: agents obtain more esteem from peers if they conform in their choice of values; but they may obtain more self-esteem if they differentiate. This tension explains why, for instance, peer effects are sometimes positive and sometimes negative.

"Seed dormancy cycling and the regulation of dormancy mechanisms to time germination in variable field environments.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/84455/","Finch-Savage, William E.; Footitt, Steven","April 2010","Many molecular mechanisms that regulate dormancy have been identified individually in controlled laboratory studies. However, little is known about how the seed employs this complex suite of mechanisms during dormancy cycling in the variable environment of the soil seed bank. Nevertheless, this behavior is essential to ensure germination takes place in a favourable habitat and climate space, and in the correct season for the resulting plant to complete its life cycle. During their time in the soil seed bank seeds continually adjust their dormancy status by sensing a range of environmental signals. Those related to slow seasonal change (e.g. temperature) are used for temporal sensing to determine the time of year and depth of dormancy. This alters their sensitivity to signals related to their spatial environment (e.g. light, nitrate, water potential) that indicate conditions are suitable for germination, and so trigger the termination of dormancy. We review work on the physiological, molecular and ecological aspects of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis and interpret it in the context of dormancy cycling in the soil seed bank. This approach has provided new insight into the coordination of mechanisms and signaling networks and the multidimensional sensing that regulates dormancy cycling in a variable environment.","AI","Warwick University"

We apply this method to French males, comparing those whose parents are North African immigrants and those with native parents. We find that both the raw and the unexplained ethnic employment differentials are larger for low-employability workers than for high-employability ones. We show in a theoretical framework that this heterogeneity can be accounted for by homogeneous underlying mechanisms and is not evidence for, say, heterogeneous discrimination. Finally, we discuss our main empirical findings in the light of simple taste-based vs. statistical discrimination models.","AI","Warwick University"

"Essays in development economics.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/92086/","Ammon, Kerstin Christina","December 2015","This thesis is a collection of three essays studying firms in low income countries. The first chapter explores how relational contracts that substitute for formal contracts in the presence of weak institutions, are affected by changes to the outside option of one of the parties. I investigate this question by assessing how a change in the pay-off of cultivating an alternative crop by farmers affects the relationship with downstream buyers in the sugar industry in colonial Taiwan (1895-1945). Using novel historic sugar mill level data, I analyse effects on interlinked lending and the provision of inputs by mills to farmers following a reversal of the downward price trend of the main alternative crop, rice. In the second chapter, which is co-authored with Anna Baiardi, we empirically assess the importance of ethnic networks in facilitating international trade. In particular, we investigate the impact of ethnic Cantonese networks in the United States on the export performance of firms based in Southern China. In the third chapter, I investigate whether the dominance of small firms in developing countries can be explained by the production of customised goods, which allows smaller and less efficient firms to compete with larger and more efficient modern firms. I incorporate this hypothesis in a model, in which the key variables impacting the profitability of the customised technology and thus firm size are transport costs and income.","AI","Warwick University"

To accomplish the aims of synthesising colloids for mobility, adhesion and also encapsulation we formed a specific strategy. We aimed to increase the anionic surface charge on colloidal nanoparticles as a means to aid mobility studies of colloids through soil by providing increased repulsive forces to prevent adhesion to both air interfaces and soil. We also designed a way to decorate colloidal nanoparticles with microgel particles thus forming a soft adhesive surface layer with which further functionality could be incorporated i.e. surface charges.

For this to happen robustly to all smooth perturbations, the transition state must be normally hyperbolic. The dividing surface then has locally minimal geometric flux through it, giving a useful upper bound on the rate of transport in either direction.","AI","Warwick University"

"A predictive model of bacterial cell division.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/77685/","Broughton, Claire E.","January 2015","A mathematical model of the formation and contraction of the prokaryotic Z-ring in vivo was developed, based on the polymerisation and membrane anchor binding activity of the FtsZ protein as measured in vitro. From a set of kinetic parameters that are estimated from the experimental literature, the model, which is referred to as Critical Accumulation of Membrane-bound FtsZ Fibres (CAM-FF), predicts one of three cell division outcomes: i) division proceeds to completion, ii) division is initiated but stalls prior to completion, and iii) division is not initiated. CAM-FF was validated by the accurate prediction of the effect of deletion of the membrane anchor proteins ZipA and FtsA, and was used to predict an order of efficiency of the biochemical targets for antibacterial drug design as follows: FtsZ polymerisation > ZipA/FtsA availability > FtsZ GTP-binding. The temperature-sensitivity of the ftsZ84 mutant was also analysed using CAM-FF and it was found that an acquired ATPase activity of the FtsZ84 protein (FtsZ G105S) could explain the temperature-sensitivity of cell growth. At lower temperatures where the ATPase activity is low, a functional Z-ring is able to form and contract. However, at 42 °C the increase in the ATPase rate causes the Z-ring to disassemble and cell division is inhibited. On purification of the FtsZ G105S mutant protein, a significant ATPase activity was observed in vitro that was absent in the wild-type FtsZ protein. Therefore, the ATPase activity is not an experimental artifact, as was previously thought. The ZapA and ZipA roteins were also purified, and the FtsA protein was overexpressed for subsequent purification, in preparation for crystallography and in vitro cell division reconstitution studies. A set of linear DNA molecules with defined length and GC content was designed and produced for the investigation of polymer hysteresis in flow.","AI","Warwick University"

Little is known of how the seeds respond to the soil seed bank environment following dispersal in spring into the short-term seed bank before seedling emergence in autumn.  Seeds of the winter annual Arabidopsis ecotype Cvi were buried in field soils in spring and recovered monthly until autumn and their molecular eco-physiological responses were recorded. DOG1 expression is initially low and then increases as dormancy increases. MFT expression is negatively correlated with germination potential. Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) signalling responds rapidly following burial and adjusts to the seasonal change in soil temperature. Collectively these changes align germination potential with the optimum climate space for seedling emergence.  Seeds naturally dispersed to the soil in spring enter a shallow dormancy cycle dominated by spatial sensing that adjusts germination potential to the maximum when soil environment is most favourable for germination and seedling emergence upon soil disturbance. This behaviour differs subtly from that of seeds overwintered in the soil seed bank to spread the period of potential germination in the seed population (existing seed bank and newly dispersed). As soil temperature declines in autumn, deep dormancy is re-imposed as seeds become part of the persistent seed bank.","AI","Warwick University"

The genes encoding this apparatus are located on a pathogenicity island (the locus of enterocyte effacement) and are transcriptionally activated by the master regulator Ler. In each pathotype Ler is also known to regulate genes located elsewhere on the chromosome, but the full extent of the Ler regulon is unclear, especially for enteropathogenic E. coli. The Ler regulon was defined for two strains of E. coli: E2348/69 (enteropathogenic) and EDL933 (enterohaemorrhagic) in mid and late log phases of growth by DNA microarray analysis of the transcriptomes of wild-type and ler mutant versions of each strain. In both strains the Ler regulon is focused on the locus of enterocyte effacement – all major transcriptional units of which are activated by Ler, with the sole exception of the LEE1 operon during mid-log phase growth in E2348/69. However, the Ler regulon does extend more widely and also includes unlinked pathogenicity genes: in E2348/69 more than 50 genes outside of this locus were regulated, including a number of known or potential pathogenicity determinants; in EDL933 only 4 extra-LEE genes, again including known pathogenicity factors, were activated. In E2348/69, where the Ler regulon is clearly growth phase dependent, a number of genes including the plasmid-encoded regulator operon perABC, were found to be negatively regulated by Ler. Negative regulation by Ler of PerC, itself a positive regulator of the ler promoter, suggests a negative feedback loop involving these proteins.","AI","Warwick University"

Atthe organisational level, by making use the perceptions of HR managers as well asself-evaluation from returnees, the advantages and disadvantages of returnees wereexplored, together with their actual utilisation, the rationales behind the HRstrategies adopted by the two organisations. This led to an understanding of howthe integration of returnees is affected by different social and corporate settings.","AI","Warwick University"
"Characterisation of dormancy cycling responses to environmental signals in contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57478/","Huang, Ziyue","April 2013","Seed dormancy is an important trait refined by evolution, to aid survival inadverse environments and to time germination and thereby select the correct habitatand climate space for subsequent plant growth and reproduction. Depth of dormancychanges continuously in response to the environment surrounding the seed and istherefore a relative rather than an absolute condition. In nature, these changes aretriggered by seasonally characteristic environmental signals that are integrated by theseed over time to select the optimum conditions for germination.The mechanisms by which environmental signals influence this dormancycycling have been studied in the present work using a combination of eco-physiologyand molecular biology. Two contrasting Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes Cape VerdiIsle (Cvi) and Burren (Bur) have been compared. They are adapted to a hot dry (Cvi)and a cool damp (Bur) climate and exhibit winter and summer annual phenotypesrespectively. Experimental work in the laboratory, controlled environment and fieldhas focussed on the effect of temperature, light and nitrate during seed maturationand subsequent imbibition. The work was also extended to studying other life cycleevents such as the transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth,flowering and seed maturity. This work has extended our understanding of theresponses of life cycle traits to environmental signals. However, climates arechanging and further data was collected in a series of experiments in a uniquethermal gradient tunnel to provide insight into the impact of predicted globalwarming scenarios on these traits. The results presented indicate the plasticity of theplant life cycle and the extent to which global warming might affect this inArabidopsis, and how increased temperature is likely to affect different annualphenotypes.","AI","Warwick University"
"Atlantic contingency : Jonathan Dickinson and the Anglo-Atlantic world, 1655-1725.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/58038/","Daniels, Jason (Researcher in history)","March 2013","This dissertation is about how Jonathan Dickinson (1663-1722), a second-generationAnglo-Jamaican planter and early-Philadelphian merchant, made sense of the mercurialand uncertain Atlantic world around the turn of the eighteenth century. The followingchapters examine Dickinson’s interactions with an extremely diverse group of European,Native American, and African peoples who collectively comprised a formativegeneration of colonial society in North America and the West Indies. The main purposeof this dissertation is to provide a counterpoint to the many tautologous, whiggish, andnationalistic interpretations of Anglo-Atlantic history that tend to deemphasise theobvious disconnections, disruptions, discord, and diversity apparent during the lateseventeenthand early-eighteenth centuries. This dissertation further contends thatindividuals, driven by self-preservation and influenced by local circumstances, dictatedthe direction and the pace of many inter-colonial, inter-imperial, and trans-Atlanticdevelopments familiar to the late-eighteenth century Anglo-Atlantic world. In short, newexigencies outweighed custom, and self-preservation, rather than directives frommetropolitan governments, guided Atlantic peoples’ actions. By extension of individualactions, the nascent British Atlantic Empire began to take shape.","AI","Warwick University"
"A geometrical-based approach to recognise structure of complex interiors.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/55722/","Abdul Shukor, Shazmin","February 2013","3D modelling of building interiors has gained a lot of interest recently, specifically since therise of Building Information Modeling (BIM). A number of methods have been developed inthe past, however most of them are limited to modelling non-complex interiors. 3D laserscanners are the preferred sensor to collect the 3D data, however the cost of state-of-the-artlaser scanners are prohibitive to many. Other types of sensors could also be used to generatethe 3D data but they have limitations especially when dealing with clutter and occlusions.This research has developed a platform to produce 3D modelling of building interiors whileadapting a low-cost, low-level laser scanner to generate the 3D interior data. The PreSuRealgorithm developed here, which introduces a new pipeline in modelling building interiors,combines both novel methods and adapts existing approaches to produce the 3D modelling ofvarious interiors, from sparse room to complex interiors with non-ideal geometrical structure,highly cluttered and occluded. This approach has successfully reconstructed the structure ofinteriors, with above 96% accuracy, even with high amount of noise data and clutter. Thetime taken to produce the resulting model is almost real-time, compared to existingtechniques which may take hours to generate the reconstruction. The produced model is alsoequipped with semantic information which differentiates the model from a regular 3D CADdrawing and can be use to assist professionals and experts in related fields.","AI","Warwick University"

Thishyperglycaemia is preceded by a short period of hypoglycaemia, which may becaused by: (i) increased insulin secretion or release from dying cells; (ii) rapid β-cellproliferation; and (iii) increased insulin sensitivity. This thesis characterizes theinitial stages of the expression of c-MYC in the plns-c-MycERTAM mouse model andattempts to identify the causes of the transient hypoglycaemia using mathematicalmodels. Furthermore, microarray data were analysed to investigate the earlyhypoglycaemia from the point of view of transcriptomics. The size and mass of β-cells were quantified during the transient period of hypoglycaemia by means ofimmunohistochemistry. These data were incorporated in a detailed mathematicalmodel of β-cell dynamics.","AI","Warwick University"
"Investigation on the dynamics of gravity-driven coastal currents.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/47656/","Gregorio, S. O.

In addition, results of two new laboratory studies with different scalesfor plumes owing along a more realistic inclined-wall coastline are presentedand compared to an extended theoretical model from the geostrophic theory ofThomas & Linden (2007). The theoretical and experimental results for plumesflowing along inclined-wall coastlines are compared to the inclined-wall experimental studies of Avicola & Huq (2002), Whitehead & Chapman (1986) and Lentz& Helfrich (2002), to the inclined-wall scaling theory of Lentz & Helfrich (2002),and to oceanic observations. The lengths, widths and velocities of the buoyantgravity currents are studied. Agreement between the laboratory and numericalexperiments, and the geostrophic theories for both vertical-wall and inclined-wallstudies is found to depend mainly on one non-dimensional parameter which characterizes the strength of horizontal viscous forces (the horizontal Ekman number). The best agreement between the experiments and the geostrophic theoriesis found for plumes with low viscous forces. At large values of the horizontalEkman number, laboratory and numerical experiments depart more significantlyfrom theory (e.g., in the plume propagation velocity). At very low values ofthe horizontal Ekman number (obtained in the large-scale inclined-wall experimental study only), departures between experiments and theory are observed aswell. Agreement between experiments and theory is also found to depend on thesteepness of the plumes isopycnal interface for the vertical-wall study, and on theratio between the isopycnal and coastline slopes for the inclined-wall study.","AI","Warwick University"
"Habitus, reflexividade e realismo.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/38592/","Archer, Margaret Scotford","April 2011","Many scholars continue to ascribe a fundamental role to routine action in social theory and defend the continuing relevance of Bourdieu's concept of habitus. Meanwhile, the majority recognize the importance of reflexivity. In this article, Archer examines three versions of efforts to render these concepts mutually compatible: ""empirical combination"", ""hybridization"", and ""theoretical and ontological reconciliation"". In analytical terms, none of these versions is fully successful. The empirical argument is that the relevance of habitus began to decline in the late 20th century, in light of major structural changes in advanced capitalist democracies. In these circumstances, habitual forms have proven incapable of providing guidelines for people's lives, thus making reflexivity necessary. The article concludes with the argument that even the reproduction of one's birth history now constitutes a reflexive activity, and that the most favorable mode of its production, which the author refers to as ""communicative reflexivity"", is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain.","AI","Warwick University"

"An edition of Lady Hester Pulters Book of Emblemes.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/169611/","Eardley, Alice","July 2008","Lady Hester Pulter's literary manuscript, comprising over one hundred poems and a prose romance, was uncovered in Leeds University Brotherton Library in 1996. Since then, there has been increasing scholarly interest in Pulter's compositions but as yet no edition of her text has been produced. In response to this, the main focus of this thesis is an annotated edition of Pulter's book of 'Emblemes' (c. 1650-60), a series of fifty-three un-illustrated emblem poems occupying a separately designated portion of the manuscript volume. The edition of Pulter's 'Emblemes' is accompanied by a critical introduction to the text, comprising a biography of Pulter, a discussion of the manuscript, and two chapters of literary criticism. The biography (Chapter One) provides new evidence regarding Pulter's date of birth and also her extended social circle, which included Archbishop James Ussher and a group of MPs involved in the peace negotiations with Charles I in 1648. The discussion of her text (Chapter Two) draws on this evidence to consider both the material and intellectual contexts within which Pulter was writing. The first of the two critical chapters (Chapter Three) responds to current studies of royalist writing and considers Pulter's distinctively gendered, Stoic response to the English Civil Wars and Interregnum. The second critical chapter (Chapter Four) compares Pulter's manuscript collection with George Wither's printed edition of Emblemes (163 5). It considers the way both writers support the political message of their text through the manipulation of the emblem's formal elements and cultural associations. The central argument of this thesis is that Pulter's manuscript volume, circulated within the confines of her home in rural Hertfordshire, was not simply a rhetorical intervention in political events but a mode of promoting and enacting a direct and practical engagement with the social and political circumstances of Interregnum England.","AI","Warwick University"

In this theydiffer from BNs and other structures with variable-based topologies. Chapter 1 detailsresearchers' attempts to adapt BNs to model such problems, and outlines the advantages CEGshave over these adaptations. Chapter 2 describes the construction of CEGs.In chapter 3I create a semantic structure for the reading of CEGs, and derive results expressiblein the form of context-specific conditional independence statements, that allow us to delvemuch more deeply into the independence structure of a problem than we can do with BNs. Inchapter 4I develop algorithms for the updating of a CEG following observation of an event,analogous to the Local Message Passing algorithms used with BNs. These are more efficientthan the BN-based algorithms when used with asymmetric problems.Chapter 5 develops the theory of Causal manipulation of CEGs, and introduces the singularmanipulation, a class of interventions containing the set of interventions possible with BNs. Iproduce Back Door and Front Door Theorems analogous to those of Pearl [42], but moreflexible as they allow asymmetric manipulations of asymmetric problems.

"The literary impact of the Haitian Revolution.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4122/","Kaisary, Philip James","March 2008","The Haitian Revolution (1 791-1804) reshaped the debates about slavery andfreedom in Europe, accelerated the abolitionist movement, precipitatedrebellions in neighbouring territories, and intensified both repression and antislaverysentiment. Its long-term effects remain visible in the manyrepresentations, recuperations, and invocations of the Revolution as anexemplar of black agency. At the same time, the violence of the conflict led toportrayals of Haiti as unregenerate and primitive, a prey to 'voodoo' andlawlessness. Hence the recuperation of Haiti's political and cultural history, inwhich the establishment of the first postcolonial nation must be accounted foras a momentous event despite its ostensible failure, contests the tradition ofimperial denigration. The thesis addresses how the Haitian Revolution followedby the establishment of a Black Republic, provided inspiration for writers,artists and intellectuals throughout the Atlantic Diaspora in diverse cultural andintellectual locations from the 1920s onwards. If public knowledge aboutHaitian history has for some time now been limited in Europe and NorthAmerica, the Revolution has been a potent factor in black memory and itremains an inspiration to Carib beans, Africans, African Americans, and LatinAmericans, as well as to radical intellectuals and artists worldwide. The thesisstudies the writings generated by the Revolution in the works of Aime Cesaire,C. L. R. James, Rene Depestre, Langston Hughes, Edouard Glissant, AlejoCarpentier, Derek Walcott, and Madison Smartt Bell, spanning French, English,and Spanish, and including poetry, drama, history, biography, fiction, andopera; while in the visual arts it considers the paintings of Kimathi Donkor andcommemorative postage stamps. My discussion addresses both criticalunderstandings and fictional reinventions of the Revolution's achievement andtragic reversals. I examine the ideologies informing the analyses, and theaesthetics of the imaginative writings, where a political stance in some casesserved to promote innovation and experimental style and in others was aconstraint.","AI","Warwick University"
"Constructing concepts of learner autonomy in language education in the Chinese context : a narrative-based inquiry into university students conceptions of successful English language learning.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4115/","Jiang, Xiaoli","January 2008","The present study aims to explore Chinese learners' conceptions of learnerautonomy from learners' perspective since researchers in language educationargue that concepts of learner autonomy may bear cultural imprints and recentcollege English language education reform in China sets learner autonomy as aprime goal.The study first presents general background and an introduction to the researchcontext. There follows a comprehensive literature review, tracking origins of theconcept of learner autonomy in the fields of philosophy, general education, andlanguage education, with distinctive 'Western' and 'Chinese' emphases. This isfollowed by a review of relevant research on learner autonomy in languageeducation, which consists of research on learner autonomy as a concept, as ameans for effective learning, relationships with culture, and methodologicalissues. To investigate Chinese learners' conceptions of learner autonomy, thestudy adopted a mixed research approach to collect data: with a qualitativemethod as the main research method to capture in-depth understandings oflearners' conceptions, and a quantitative method as a supplementary one tosupport qualitative data findings and at the same time reveal further diversity.Moreover, to avoid any imposition of learner autonomy theory pre-occupied inthe researcher's mind, the study does not ask directly about learner autonomy tolearners but instead examines whether concepts of learner autonomy areembedded in students' accounts of successful English language learning.The study involved 27 interviews and a questionnaire survey of 450 collegeEnglish language learners among three different Chinese universities. The mainfindings of the study are as follows: 1) Both 'Western' and 'Chinese' emphasesand core elements of learner autonomy are found in Chinese learners'conceptions of successful English language learning; 2) Chinese learners'conceptions of learner autonomy are found to exist in two distinctive domains:learner autonomy for academic success (LAAS) and learner autonomy forcommunicative competence (LACC). 3) Learners' conceptions of learnerautonomy can be influenced by different sources: political, economical, social,cultural, and individual. 4) Learners' conceptions of learner autonomy aredynamic, and subject to various factors such as progress of level of educationand individual language learning experiences.Based on the data findings, a reconsideration of concepts of learner autonomydrawn out from students' conceptions of successful English language learning isdiscussed, which combines 'Western', 'Chinese' emphases and core elements oflearner autonomy, associated behaviours, and sources of influences on them.This reconstruction of the concept of learner autonomy in the Chinese contextcontributes to a better understanding of learner autonomy theory. The researchhas important implications for policy makers, teachers, parents, and students inunderstanding learner autonomy from learners' perspectives and for researchinto concepts of learner autonomy in different contexts.","AI","Warwick University"
"Embodying active ageing: bodies, emotions and risk in later life.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2385/","Martin, Wendy","June 2007","The promotion of 'active' ageing in later life has been a key development in recent health policy. These changes not only challenge the prevalent view of old age as an inevitable process of biological decline but signify the tendency of lay and expert discourses to increasingly use the notion of risk. Older people's social identities also need to be negotiated in the context of positive (active/freedom/fluid) and negative (passive/dependence/decline) images of ageing. This thesis explored older people's social identities; meanings about lifestyles, emotions, and bodies; and the salience and limitations to 'risk' and 'reflexivity' within everyday life. The research involved the intersection of in-depth qualitative interviews with photo-elicitation with 50 men and women aged between 50 and 96 years. Thematic analysis using Atlas Ti was undertaken. Three interconnected themes emerged:1) Participants experienced their bodies as a taken-for- granted aspect of their everyday lives until moments when an awareness of the body interrupted their daily activities. At these moments the everyday visibility of the body was heightened and participants reflected on their own meanings and identities about ageing.2) Emotions were significant as participants described their everyday lives and social interactions. There was a continual tension between inner (private) subjective feelings and experiences of emotions and the outer (public) bodily and spatial expression of these emotions.3) Reflexive meanings about risk were multifaceted as participants drew upon diverse discourses when making choices about health-related lifestyles. A sense of embodied vulnerability associated with ageing was evident.Meanings and perspectives associated with ageing bodies were therefore central to everyday experiences of growing older. Alternative images of ageing were intertwined within the accounts of the participants as they fluctuated between a sense of ageing as a time of possibilities and a heightened awareness of their embodied vulnerabilities.","AI","Warwick University"
"Identity transformation and Japans UN security policy: from the Gulf Crisis to human security.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1141/","Dhirathiti, Nopraenue Sajjarax","April 1966","This research uses discourse analysis to examine Japan's UN security policy after the Cold War period using three cases: the Gulf Crisis, the Cambodian peace process and the promotion of the human security policy. The key argument is that there is a need for a new IR theory-based approach that could explain foreign or security policy decision-making process and could also provide the analysis at both the domestic and the international level simultaneously. This research therefore adopts Wendt's Constructivism, along with the use of 'identity' as the key analytical platform, from which the 'recursive Constructivist model' is developed. Unlike popular literature, this research suggests that 'identity transformation' and the level of conformity between the identities projected internationally (international -role identities) and those embraced domestically (domestic-type identities) are the key factors determining Japan's foreign and security policy preferences. On the interpretation of Japan's post-Cold War security development, this research argues that it could be understood via the UN framework, and not only from the traditional perspective of the Japan-US alliance. Apart from the fact that it could be understood via the process of 'identity transformation', this research provides strong evidence and suggestions that Japan's assertive foreign and security pursuits in the post-Cold War era are the result of the nation's changing sets of ideas and beliefs on the link between 'national' and 'international' security.The original contributions of this research are two-fold. The theoretical contribution is a modification of Wendt's original framework of identity transformation into the so-called 'recursive process of identity transformation. ' The application of 'identity' and the 'recursive Constructivist model' to Japan's UN security policy in this research is significant because it is the first example among research in the field of Japanese studies to use a different analytical framework and tool in examining Japan's foreign and security policy. The model's ability to capture the intertwined process of social interactions at both the domestic and the international level is also important as it contributes to further IR theoretical development and a better understanding on Japan's foreign policy decision-making process. Also, the value-added benefit of the examination of human security policy is another vital substantive contribution, as this is the first exploration of this issue within the context of Japan's UN security policy.","AI","Warwick University"
"From intimate pleasures to spectacular vistas: musicality and historicity in French and American classical cinema of the 1930s.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1119/","Brown, Tom","April 1993","This thesis considers the role of spectacle in two modes of filmmaking in the French and American 'classical' cinemas of the 1930s. I examine the relationship of spectacle to the emotions and drama of musical films, and to the `history-telling' of biopics, war films and other genres of historical cinema. One reason for the comparison is the hegemonic position of classical Hollywood cinema in film scholarship. Although I am respectful of the insights offered by the concept of a `classical' cinema, a more central motivation for this study is the failure of much criticism to account for the relationship of spectacle to a concept denoting an unobtrusive, self-effacing style.An introduction is followed by a chapter surveying key literature in the field, focusing in particular on work on classical French and American cinema, cinematic spectacle and filmic, particularly generic, categories. The second chapter is divided roughly in two. The first half examines the various theatrical roots of French and American musical films of the thirties. The second half examines the `utopian' feelings (Dyer, ([1977] 1992) musical spectacle serves. This division uncovers the greater ambivalence of French musical films, and their more circuitous approach to spectacle. Chapter three examines historical films through categories inspired by the work of Friedrich Nietzsche ([1874] 1983). I examine the prevailing `monumental' approach to historical subjects, but also two key varieties of spectacle: the `spectacular vista' and the `decor of history'. I conclude by reflecting on the possibility of a critical historiography within French and American film of the thirties.Though the balance of my attention favours French examples in the chapter on musical films, my intention throughout is to compare and, where fruitful, contrast the two national cinemas. The thesis develops theoretical but, even more, practical understandings of particular kinds of spectacle; they are susceptible of the practice of close textual analysis. This is my central method of investigation. I attempt, throughout, to place the examination of films within their wider historical, industrial and critical contexts.","AI","Warwick University"
"The French reception of British cinema.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2437/","Wimmer, Leïla","April 1993","French writings on British cinema have tended, and continue, to be dominated by one single figure. Director Francois Truffaut's famous dismissal of British cinema has become a standard reference. The systematic repetition of his critique has worked to produce an official story that has become emblematic of the French perspective on British cinema. Yet to date the subject has received little scholarly attention beyond Truffaut.This study documents in depth the French reception of British cinema in the post-war period and relies extensively on the use of archives and research into primary sources including unpublished historical documents and the use of oral sources. These are supplemented by secondary materials such as survey histories of cinema, national film histories, anthologies of film criticism and biographies of film critics and film journals.The thesis is divided into four chapters that relate to four distinct historical periods from the immediate post-war years up to the late 1990s. In each of the chapters I relocate critical texts and ideas within the historical conjuncture from which they have emerged. In the process, the thesis uncovers positive readings of British cinema and thus redresses the historiography that has characterised the representation of the French perspective as uniformly negative. The central argument of this thesis centres on an examination of critical writings as inverted discourses on French cinema. Considering contemporary reviews as a prism through which the identity of French cinema may be articulated or refracted, I show that the discourses of auteurism and realism have played a key role in the debates around cinema and thus in the critical construction of British cinema. I conclude that the French reception of British cinema must be understood as an articulation of anxieties, concerns and struggles around the identity of French cinema itself.","AI","Warwick University"

"Internet and competitive advantage: an empirical study of UK retail banking sector.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2846/","Porter, Qing Amie","November 2005","There is wide agreement that the Internet has had a significant impact on the retail banking sector. However, no consensus has formed as to whether the Internet can provide retail banks with competitive advantage and if so, whether this competitive advantage is sustainable. This research project examines the provision of Internet usage in the UK retail banking sector. The goals of this study are threefold: 1) to explore the notion of ""competitive advantage"" in retail banking, 2) to understand why managers of retail banks invest in the Internet and what they consider are the advantages of Internet banking and 3) to ascertain why some managers of retail banks are more convinced of the benefits of the Internet as a generator of competitive advantage than others and whether this relates to the characteristics of their bank and/or its Internet strategies. A model of the use of the Internet in retail banking was developed. An analysis framework, based on the competitive advantage that the use of the Internet may produce, was also built up. In addition, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies was utilised. Interviews were formulated and undertaken in order to extend the findings in the extant literature, and to further confirm and refine the theoretical framework of this study. Then utilising the results of the interviews, a survey was conducted and 151 senior managers responded. The responding mangers came from both small and large retail banks and, in addition, from building societies. They held a variety of different positions within their organisations. The thesis produced a number of significant findings. The concept of `competitive advantage' was defined in the UK retail banking sector. Key factors that provide retail banks with competitive advantage were identified; namely; ""differentiation"", ""cost leadership"" and ""product uniqueness"". These resembled Porter's generic strategies, however, the results rejected his concept of the ""stuck-in-the-middle"" competitive situation. He had indicated that an integrated strategy using more than one form of competitive advantage is likely to fail to achieve advantage. The results indicate that combined strategies are not only possible, but are likely to be the most successful overall Internet strategy for retail banking firms to pursue. The research concluded that the size and type of retail bank has direct impact on Internet strategy. Managers' perceptions of competitive advantage provided by the Internet is affected, both by the characteristics of their firms, and also by the Internet strategies that their banks employed. Internet strategies are confirmed to be mediation variables and have a good fit with the resource based view. This indicates that resource and core competences are crucial to the decision about which Internet strategies to employ to achieve maximum competitive advantage. The research therefore found that, in the Internet arena, the market-based view and the resource based perspective of competitive advantage may be seen as complementary as they are concerned with different domains (i. e. external and internal respectively). However when considering the issue of sustainability, a hypercompetitive view is more appropriate. It suggests that constantly being flexible, innovative and quickly responding to the changing environment are the foundations required for firms to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Further, a number of issues were identified to be important for the future of Internet banking.","AI","Warwick University"
"Construction and assessment of risk models in medicine.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/79266/","Kallis, Constantinos","April 2005","This thesis investigates the application of classical and contemporary statistical methods in medical research attempting to bridge the gap between statistics and clinical medicine. The importance of using simple and advanced statistical methods in constructing and assessing risk models in medicine will be demonstrated by empirical studies related to vascular complications: namely abdominal aortic aneurysm and diabetic retinopathy.First, data preprocessing and preliminary statistical analysis are examined and their application is investigated using data on abdominal aortic aneurysm. We illustrate that when dealing with missing data, the co-operation between statisticians and clinicians is necessary. Also, we show advantages and disadvantages of exploratory analysis.Second, we describe and compare classification models for AAA selective screening. Tow logistic regression models are proposed. We also show that it is important to assess the performance of classifiers by cross-validation and bootstrapping. We also examine models that include other definitions of abnormality, weighted classification and multiple class models.Third, we consider the application of graphical models. We look at different types of graphical models that can be used for classification and for identifying the underlying data structure. The use of Naïve Bayes classifier (NBC) is shown and subsequently we illustrate the Occam’s window model selection in a statistical package for Mixed Interactions Modelling (MIM). The EM-algorithm and multiple imputation method are used to deal with inconsistent entries in the dataset. Finally, modelling mixture of Normal components is investigated by graphical modelling and compared with an alternative minimisation procedure.Finally, we examine risk factors of diabetic sight threating retinopathy (STR). We show the complexity of data preparation and preliminary analysis as well as the importance of using the clinicians’ opinion on selecting appropriate variables. Blood pressure measurements have been examined as predictors of STR. The fundamental role of imputation and its influence on the conclusions of the study are demonstrated.From this study, we conclude that the application of statistics in medicine is an optimisation procedure where both the statistical and the clinical validity need to be taken into account. Also, the combination of simple and advanced methods should be used as it provides additional information. Data, software and time limitations should be considered before and during statistical analysis and appropriate modifications might be implemented to avoid compromising the quality of the study. Finally, medical research should be regarded for statisticians and clinicians as part of a learning process.","AI","Warwick University"
"A study of school improvement : understanding the processes and outcomes of planned pedagogical improvement in independent preparatory schools.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4065/","Wilson, Jan","June 2004","This thesis describes the processes and outcomes of planned pedagogicalimprovement in a group of independent preparatory schools. It is an ethnographicinvestigation of these schools, which were researched and reported as multiplecomposite case studies.The research focuses upon two unusual and different aspects of school improvement.Firstly, a central theme of the study is the importance of the dynamic betweenimprovement in classroom practice and the concomitant modification to schoolorganisational arrangements.T he cases tudiesi nvestigate the essenceo f themteractional processes that the schools experienced during implementing a process ofpedagogical improvement, and as a result, a model is proposed to suggest a possibleway of understanding the school improvement processes in these schools. Secondly,the research has been undertaken in the independent primary (preparatory) sector,where there has been little research undertaken and a dearth of literature that is usefuland relevant to the culture of these schools specifically.The thesis examines and analysest he constraints,p roblems and successesth at theschools faced; and in particular considers individual and organisational capacitybuilding, the stages that the teachers and schools moved through, the processes,consequences and outcomes and whether the pedagogical improvements could besustained.The writer presents an empirical model of the process and argues that the evidencecould be related, in a meaningful way, to other independent preparatory schools.The outcomes of the evidence appears to indicate that effective pedagogicalimprovement processes, that focus on modifying classroom practice and improvingchildren's achievement, can be strategies for educational change; which can lead toadaptations and improvements within the organisational management arrangements,systems and controls within the school to support teaching and learning.","AI","Warwick University"
"Information and optimisation in investment and risk measurement.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/56096/","Kemkhadze, Nato","April 2004","The thesis explores applications of optimisation in investment management and riskmeasurement. In investment management the information issues are largely concernedwith generating optimal forecasts. It is difficult to get inputs that have the propertiesthey are supposed to have. Thus optimisation is prone to 'Garbage In, Garbage Out', thatleads to substantial biases in portfolio selection, unless forecasts are adjusted suitablyfor estimation error. We consider three case studies where we investigate the impact offorecast error on portfolio performance and examine ways of adjusting for resulting bias.Treynor and Black (1973) first tried to make the best possible use of the informationprovided by security analysis based on Markovitz (1952) portfolio selection. Theyestablished a relationship between the correlation of forecasts, the number of independentsecurities available and the Sharpe ratio which can be obtained. Their analysis was basedon the assumption that the correlation between the forecasts and outcomes is known precisely.In practice, given the low levels of correlation possible, an investor may believehimself to have a different degree of correlation from what he actually has. Using twodifferent metrics we explore how the portfolio performance depends on both the anticipatedand realised correlation when these differ. One measure, the Sharpe ratio, capturesthe efficiency loss, attributed to the change in reward for risk. The other measure, theGeneralised Sharpe Ratio (GSR), introduced by Hodges (1997), quantifies the reductionin the welfare of a particular investor due to adopting an inappropriate risk profile. Weshow that these two metrics, the Sharpe ratio and GSR, complement each other and incombination provide a fair ranking of existing investment opportunities.Using Bayesian adjustment is a popular way of dealing with estimation error in portfolioselection. In a Bayesian implementation, we study how to use non-sample informationto infer optimal scaling of unknown forecasts of asset returns in the presence of uncertaintyabout the quality of our information, and how the efficient use of information affects portfoliodecision. Optimal portfolios, derived under full use of information, differ strikinglyfrom those derived from the sample information only; the latter, unlike the former, arehighly affected by estimation error and favour several (up to ten) times larger holdings.The impact of estimation error in a dynamic setting is particularly severe because of thecomplexity of the setting in which it is necessary to have time varying forecasts. We takeBrennan, Schwartz and Lagnado's structure (1997) as a specific illustration of a genericproblem and investigate the bias in long-term portfolio selection models that comes fromoptimisation with (unadjusted) parameters estimated from historical data. Using a MonteCarlo simulation analysis, we quantify the degree of bias in the optimisation approach ofBrennan, Schwartz and Lagnado. We find that estimated parameters make an investorbelieve in investment opportunities five times larger than they actually are. Also a mild realtime-variation in opportunities inflates wildly when measured with estimated parameters.In the latter part of the thesis we look at slightly less straightforward optimisationapplications in risk measurement, which arise in reporting risk. We ask, what is the mostefficient way of complying with the rules? In other words, we investigate how to reportthe smallest exposure within a rule. For this purpose we develop two optimal efficientalgorithms that calculate the minimal amount of the position risk required, to cover afirm's open positions and obligations, as required by respective rules in the FSA (FinancialSecurities Association) Handbook. Both algorithms lead to interesting generalisations.","AI","Warwick University"
"Electronic transport in single-walled carbon nanotubes, and their application as scanning probe microscopy tips.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4059/","Wilson, Neil R.","April 2004","Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are remarkable molecules composedof a graphite sheet rolled into a seamless cylinder. With nanometer diameter,and micrometer length, their physical properties are due to a mixture of quantumand classical effects. This work investigates the electrical transport properties ofthese molecules, and demonstrates their application as Atomic Force Microscopy(AFM) tips.SWNTs were grown by catalysed chemical vapour deposition (cCVD), andcharacterized using AFM, electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Electronicdevices were fabricated from SWNTs grown by cCVD on Si02. Electronic transportthrough the SWNT devices was studied using electric force microscopy (EFM) andscanned gate microscopy (SGM). SGM was used to study the effects of defects ontransport through the devices. A novel form of SGM, based on the modulation ofthe tip-gating potential by the oscillating tip in dynamic mode AFM, was demonstratedand shown to massively enhance the signal to noise ratio. Using EFM wedirectly demonstrated the transition from ballistic transport in metallic SWNT atlow source-drain voltages, to diffusive transport at high-source drain voltages. EFMwas also used to image the charge injection induced around a SWNT at high gatevoltages, and correlate it with the observed hysteresis in the transconductance ofSWNT devices. Both of these results are of fundamental importance to the futureapplications of SWNT electronic devices. The high bias behaviour of metallic SWNTis crucial to their proposed use as interconnects in nanoscale devices. Hysteresis inthe transconductance of semiconducting SWNT devices is limiting their applicationas chemical and biological sensors, where environmental effects are monitored bythe change in conductance of the devices.SWNTs were mounted at the apex of AFM tips, and used as high resolutionscanning probe tips. Electrical transport through the SWNT-AFM tips wasinvestigated using both liquid (Hg) and solid contacts. An efficient technique forfabricating nanowire AFM tips, using SWNT-AFM tips as templates, was also invented.The resultant nanowire tips were shown to be robust, high aspect ratio,electrical probes. Using calibration samples fabricated from SWNTs, SWNT-AFMtips were quantitatively demonstrated to increase the resolution of EFM. Underoptimal conditions identical features could be distinguished down to separations aslow as 15 nm, comparable to the topographic resolution.","AI","Warwick University"
"Maximum constraint satisfaction on diamonds.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/61323/","Krokhin, Andrei; Larose, Benoit","April 1976","In this paper we study the complexity of the (weighted) maximum constr aint satisfaction problem (Max CSP) over an arbitrary finite domain. In this pro blem, one is given a collection of weighted constraints on overlapping sets of v ariables, and the goal is to find an assignment of values to the variables so as to maximize the total weight of satisfied constraints. Max Cut is a typical exa mple of a Max CSP problem. Max CSP is NP-hard in general; however, some restrict ions on the form of constraints may ensure tractability. Recent results indicate that there is a connection between tractability of such restricted problems and supermodularity of the allowed constraint types with respect to some lattice or dering of the domain. We prove several results confirming this. Diamonds are the smallest lattices in terms of the number of comparabilities, and so are as unor dered as a lattice can possibly be. In the present paper, we study Max CSP on di amond-ordered domains. We show that if all allowed constraints are supermodular with respect to such an ordering then the problem can be solved in polynomial (i n fact, in cubic) time. We also prove a partial converse: if the set of allowed constraints includes a certain small family of binary supermodular constraints on such a lattice, then the problem is tractable if and only if all of the allowed constraints are supermodular; otherwise, it is NP-hard.","AI","Warwick University"

"Das Undarstellbare darstellen : Kulturkritik and the representation of difference in the works of Anne Duden.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/63667/","Ludden, Teresa","April 1942","This thesis examines Kulturkritik and the question of the representation of difference in the work of Anne Duden. It uncovers a far-reaching interrogation of Western culture in Duden's work as oppositional relations between culture-nature, mind-body, subject and object are constantly questioned. It examinesthe criticism of the treatment of the body in Western culture which appears in the texts in a variety of ways. Though oblique reference to Cartesian and Enlightenment selves, the texts question dominant modes of being in the West and the consequences of this promotion. This is examined firstly through an analysis of Duden's essays on paintings of George and the dragon where the links between Duden's thought and the radical philosophy coming out of the 1960s are investigated. Then the prose works Ubergang and Das Judasschaf are explored to highlight the criticism of binary structures which I argue needs to be understood with reference to the types of selves and bodies which are privileged in Western culture; the production of 'useful/rational' bodies and hierarchical and oppositional subject-object, mind-matter relations prevalent in Enlightenment thought. I also argue that there is not just a criticism of structures perceived to be dominant in Western culture in Duden's texts, but that different modes of being are conveyed by the writing as differences within culture. The narrators become selves through fluid processes of interchange with the environment rather than existing as fixed entities. This analysis is linked to Duden's questioning of abstract and generalised concepts which enables a reading of the experiences of the narrators not as a 'breakdown' or loss of self, but as expressions of alternative modes of being. A close examination of the narrative style in Ubergang and Das Judasschaf analyses how selves, bodies and reality are represented. I argue that the writing is centrally concerned with areas beneath fixed forms and remains immanent to the experiences of pain, dissolution, joy, panic and the semi-conscious body rather than transcending and translating them into speech. Thus the writing continually gives us the impression that it paradoxically narrates word-less experiences. This writing of the body and other realms normally considered beyond representation questions universal norms and concepts. However, the narrative does not descend into nonsense and differences and specificities are not located beyond words but expressed in the text. The avant-garde properties of Duden's texts are examined through an analysis of montage techniques and the juxtaposition of levels of time in 'Ubergang and Das Judasschaf. Narrative and formal aspects are then explicitly linked to history and politics in an examination of Das Judasschaf and the centrality of the problem of living in a post-Holocaust culture. I will argue that the text's Kulturkritik indirectly interrogates the culture which produced the Holocaust and that the breakdown of narrative can be linked to the complexities of the post-Holocaust historical state. In addition the presentation of the Holocaust through the quotation of historical documents is understood in terms of the text's inability to represent the Holocaust. Aesthetics and politics are also brought together in the examination of the Steinschlag poems. With reference to Duden's essays on aesthetics, I argue that the Steinschlag texts speak with and through the broken remains of a language left over from the atrocities of the 20th Century. The musical re-configurations of the remnants, however, produce a negative hope by speaking from the sites of the gaps in culture and history.","AI","Warwick University"
"Systems modelling and simulation in the product development process for automotive powertrains : executive summary.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/3706/","King, Graham, Eng.D.","July 2002","This submission is a summary of the ten submissions that form the Engineering DoctoratePortfolio.The aim of the portfolio is to demonstrate the benefit of applying systems modelling andsimulation in a modified powertrain product development process.A description is given of the competitive pressures that are faced by motor manufacturers inthe global automotive business environment. Competitive pressures include a requirement forreduced time to market, exacting product quality standards, manufacturing over-capacity thatincreases fixed costs and compromises profit margins, and legislation that is increasinglydifficult to meet. High-level strategic responses that are being made by manufacturers to thesepressures are presented. Each strategic response requires organisational changes andimproved approaches to the way in which day-to-day business is conducted. Computer AidedEngineering (CAE) is presented as an approach that can help to improve the competitivenessof motor manufacturers by reducing product development time and the level of hardwareprototyping that is required.An investigation in five engineering companies yielded a number of observations about theuse of CAE and its integration into product development. Best practice in the implementationof CAE in the product development process is defined. The use of CAE by a leading motormanufacturer in powertrain development is compared with the best practice model, and it isidentified that there is a lack of coherence in the application of CAE. It is used to tacklespecific problems but the use of CAE is not integrated into the product development process.More importantly, it was found that there is limited application of systems modelling andsimulation, which is a critical technique for the effective integration of vehicle systems andthe development of on-board vehicle control systems.Before systems modelling and simulation can be applied III powertrain development, anappropriate set of tools and associated modelling architecture must be determined. Anappraisal of a range of different tools is undertaken, each tool being appraised against a set ofcriteria. A combination of DymolaIModelica and MATLAB/Simulink tools is recommendedas the optimum solution. DymolaIModelica models of the vehicle plant should be embeddedinto Simulink models that also contain controller and driver models. MATLAB should beused as the numerical engine and for the creation of user environments.Transmission calibration is selected as a suitable pilot example for applying systemsmodelling and simulation in powertrain development. Best practice in CAE implementationand the systems modelling and simulation architecture are validated using this example.Simulation models of vehicles equipped with CVT and discrete ratio automatic transmissionsare presented. A full description of the operation of the transmission system, of the simulationmodel itself, and of the validation of the model is presented in each case. The potential benefitof the CVT model in transmission calibration is demonstrated. A Transmission CalibrationSimulation Tool (TCST) is described within which the discrete ratio simulation model isencapsulated. The TCST includes a user environment in which the simulation model can beparameterised, a variety of simulation runs can be specified, and simulation results areprocessed. Development of the TCST requires an objective measure of driveability effectsthat are influenced by the transmission shift schedule. A method for objective assessment ofdriveability is developed, correlated, and implemented as an integral part of the TCST. Thiselement of the TCST allows trade-off exercises to be conducted between fuel economy anddriveability.The development of a transmission calibration based on experimental testing is comparedwith a similar exercise based on simulation testing. This study shows that, if the TCST isproperly integrated into the transmission calibration process, the vehicle test time taken tooptimise the calibration for fuel economy could be reduced by six weeks, and a week ofcalibrator time could be saved. Thus, the aim of the submission is fulfilled, since the benefitof applying systems modelling and simulation in the powertrain development process hasbeen demonstrated.It is concluded that a consistent approach is required for effectively integrating systemsmodelling and simulation into the product development process. A model is proposed thatclarifies how this can be achieved at a local level. It is proposed that in the future, the modelis applied whenever systems modelling and simulation is introduced into a powertraindepartment.","AI","Warwick University"

To understandthe phenomena of this research, to give a picture as clear as possible of the topic understudy and to determine the information that needs to be collected, a framework wasestablished.A combination of qualitative and quantitative tools (questionnaires, interviews anddocument examination) was used to meet the aims of this study. The questionnaires andinterviews were designed and tailored to relate specifically to the teachers' competenciesthat are required by the Omani Reformed General Education (the Basic Education: StageTwo). In addition, the importance and effectiveness of the programme's components werealso investigated.The questionnaires were conducted with all the student science teachers in the finalacademic year, 2000/2001, and all the teacher educators in the departments of educationalstudies in all the six Omani Colleges of Education. Sub-samples of student teachers andteacher educators were interviewed. In addition, some newly qualified teachers were alsointerviewed.To carry out a careful analysis, a framework of data analysis was developed. The resultsare divided into three main sections. The first section addresses student teachers'competencies. The second section reports the participants' evaluation of the importanceand effectiveness of the pedagogical courses. The third section covers the respondents'evaluation of the importance and the effectiveness of practicum aspects. In addition, resultsthat emerged from the two last open-ended questions in the questionnaires and interviewsand the effects of some variables on student teachers' competencies are presented.This study has indicated that while student science teachers demonstrated their ability insome competencies, they were deficient in the majority. In general, the results haveindicated that approximately 86.96% of the competencies were rated to be average whereasonly 10.87% of these competencies were viewed to be above average (i.e. competent). Inaddition, the majority of responses indicated that student teachers could use someexperiential learning methods and some different assessment tools to a limited extent butnot effectively. Furthermore, student science teachers are not fully prepared to use aproblem-solving approach and ICT in teaching science.This research has produced interesting and useful data about the student teachers'competencies and the curriculum of the colleges and the manner in which it wasimplemented. It has not only shown a serious gap between the actual needs of scienceteachers (importance) and their preparation (effectiveness) by the colleges but identifiedalso the areas of weakness. Some factors affecting the acquisition of the student teachers'competencies are addressed.Recommendations have been made for the Ministry of Higher Education for thedevelopment of the existing science teacher education programmes, and for the Ministry ofEducation (in-service teacher training).

"The determinants of employees affective commitment to the organisation under downsizing: the case of the banking industry in Korea.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1299/","Lee, Jaewon","March 2002","This thesis sets out to solve a paradox: maintaining a high level of employees' affective commitment to the organisation is assumed to be a critical factor for successful downsizing, but downsizing tends to reduce employees' affective commitment to the organisation. In seeking to resolve this paradox, the thesis aims to provide insights into how employees' affective commitment to the organisation under downsizing can be managed.The thesis first explores the mechanism through which downsizing exerts its influence on employees' affective commitment to the organisation, i.e. it examines whether downsizing affects employees' affective commitment to the organisation directly and/or indirectly through employees' daily work experiences, and seeks to determine which impact is stronger. Then, it examines whether employees' affective commitment to the organisation is really important in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour. Finally, the thesis identifies the determinants of employees' affective commitment to the organisation and investigates how and why these determinants have such effects.The results of the research show that the indirect impact of downsizing on employees' affective commitment to the organisation is much stronger than its direct impact. That is, employees' affective commitment to the organisation is slightly reduced by downsizing, but it can be maintained or enhanced if the change of employees' daily work experiences caused by downsizing is favourable to them. Moreover, employees' affective commitment to the organisation appears to be very important in terms of organisational citizenship behaviour. Finally, employees' daily work experiences affect employees' affective commitment to the organisation through their impacts on the three mediating variables (organisation-based self-esteem, perceived organisational support, and self efficacy). The results also show that organisation-based self-esteem is the key mediating variable.","AI","Warwick University"

"Processing trauma: studies into posttraumatic stress disorder, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing and posttraumatic growth.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2901/","Woodward, Clare Louise","April 0321","While PTSD results in various symptomatology, key characteristics concern a sense of being ""stuck"" on the trauma which keeps the person reliving it through thoughts, feelings and images and a need to avoid anything which reminds them of the trauma. Such avoidance is suggested to prevent the opportunity for processing and integrating the distressing material. One key clinical question is how to help the person work through their trauma without them becoming overwhelmed by trauma symptoms? Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a relatively new technique that has been reported to help PTSD sufferers reduce the intensity and intrusiveness of traumatic thoughts and images. Despite the growing clinical evidence of the effectiveness of EMDR, a strong debate exists within the research literature regarding its empirical and theoretical validity. One aspect of this dissertation is an experimental study looking at the role of eye movements in Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing and testing a working memory model of ""distress reduction"". Of course not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will go on to develop PTSD. An often neglected area of trauma investigation is how some individuals experience positive change and personal growth as a result of their traumatic experiences. This is an area that is now beginning to receive some attention and has been termed Posttraumatic Growth (PTG). The move away from looking exclusively at the impact of trauma to consider how people who have experienced trauma might construct a more positive understanding of themselves in the light of the trauma forms the main section of this dissertation. This exploratory study uses personal experience narratives of posttraumatic growth.","AI","Warwick University"
"Presidentialism in contemporary France : De Gaulle and Mitterrand.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/66773/","Knight, Louise (Researcher in History)","April 2001","This thesis examines the evolution of presidentialism in contemporary France, with particular reference to the presidencies of Charles de Gaulle (1958-1969) and Francois Mitterrand (1981-88), as articulated in constitutional studies, political writings and speeches, electoral programmes and polemics, journalism and other sources. Since the foundation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, the nature and extent of presidential power in France have been the subject of intense critical scrutiny. While there is a growing corpus of writings reflecting the diverse interpretations of the President's function, no study has yet focused upon an analysis of the debate itself. The thesis is primarily a textual study, based upon a wide range of sources. It opens with a discussion of the 1958 Constitution, the texts on which it was based, the writings of those most closely involved in its drafting and the different historical, ideological and cultural considerations underlying the concept of presidential power which it articulates. The thesis then examines the body of opposition to this conception of the presidency, focused most sharply in the polemical writings of Francois Mitterrand in the 1960s and '70s. By exploring the evolution of Mitterrand's opposition to the style of presidentialism emerging under de Gaulle, Pompidou and Giscard d'Estaing, the study identifies the beginnings of the Left's reconciliation to the institutions of the Fifth Republic, whilst also highlighting the many tensions and ambiguities to which this evolving stance gave rise.","AI","Warwick University"
"Configurations of mothering in post-war British womens playwriting.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/34665/","Komporaly, Jozefina","April 2001","While examining a selection of plays centred on the phenomenon of mothering, mythesis also investigates the interaction between theatre and feminism in post-warBritain, aiming to highlight mutual correspondences between women's theatremaking and feminist agendas. I focus mainly on the period of second-wavefeminism, but I also discuss the decade preceding the appearance of the Women'sLiberation Movement, as well as its aftermath up to the mid-nineties. Scrutinisingproto-feminist, feminist and post-feminist stances, I argue that several fifties womendramatists anticipated key concerns of the late sixties and seventies; and equally, thatmany playwrights active after the heyday of second-wave feminism revisited theclimate of the seventies in an attempt to evaluate the transformations that have sinceoccurred in women's lives. In this manner, I not only contextualise some of themajor achievements and shortcomings of successive feminist interventions, but alsoelaborate on key changes that have taken place in the negotiation of dramatic formand content.Rather than privileging one dominant theoretical position and adopting itsperspective for the purposes of my analysis, I connect the work of playwrightsinformed by different artistic positions and political convictions, in order to pinpointthe principle of co-existence and multiplicity. This aesthetic and ideological diversityin women's writing for the stage, characteristic of the past five decades, has beenconfirmed not only by the primary and secondary sources that I drew upon but alsoby the playwrights themselves, whom I interviewed. For most present-day femaledramatists, as this thesis argues, contemporary British women's theatre is a space ofexperimentation and of confluence - in which the broad range of individual voicescan situate themselves next to one another, without the urge to replicate an ultimatedirection imposed by hegemonic political constraints or artistic platforms.","AI","Warwick University"
"European banking mergers : stock market and operating performance evaluation.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4379/","Ismail, Ahmad Khalil","November 2000","There has been a new wave of merger and acquisitions (M&A) activity since the early1990's across the world, much of this occurring in the financial services industry.This trend has affected Europe as well where the landscape of the financial servicesindustry has been changing. This M&A activity in general has stimulated more indepth research to assess the consequences of the merger events, althoughcomparatively little work has been done on M&A activity in the European financialservices industry.This thesis uses a market return approach and an operating performance approach toevaluate the M&As outcome in European banking. We document a minimal totalreturn, and a smaller target return in comparison to US studies. The post-mergeroperating cash flow return on assets deteriorated but we also found a very minimalimprovement in efficiency which was not supportive enough to boost the cash flowreturn on assets and the profitability of the merging partners, although these mergerswere mainly motivated by synergy.Deeper research may provide more interesting findings using clinical studies that seekas much detailed information about the merging partners as possible. It is also worthexamining the pattern of managerial ownership and how it affects the merger outcomeas this factor is an important one for regulators in the financial services Industry.","AI","Warwick University"
"Transcultural rhythms : the Caribbean grandmother repeating across time and space.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/3642/","Bethell Bennett, Ian Anthony","March 2000","The figure of the grandmother is a rhythm which repeats itself throughoutCaribbean literature. The Caribbean literary grandmother owes a great deal to a historyof hardship under slavery and post-emancipation struggles for self-realisation andempowerment.This thesis explores the repeating theme of theme of the grandmother-headed-household inliterary works from Guadeloupe to Jamaica. The novels of Simone Schwarz-Bart, JosephZobel, Cecil Foster, Zee Edgell, Alvin Bennett, Cristina Garcia and Pablo Medina areinterrogated in this space to reveal the importance of the grandmother character as thebackbone of the works. Other novels from the region will also be utilised as secondarytexts to further demonstrate the timeless nature of the grandmother's primary role incultural retention and in the writer's imagination.Social-history provides an invaluable backdrop for understanding some of thedynamics involved in the West Indian family relationship and family structure. Theoriesas produced by theorists from within the region will be drawn upon alongside theoriesproduced outside the Caribbean. These theories are included because they allow for aculturally distinct reading of Antillian literature that does not imprison the subject asreductionist, Eurocentric theory does. The combination of these theories , will therebyallow the importance of the grandmother character to come through, not as adysfunctional copy of European models, but rather as a character constructed within aunique cultural contexts on distinct cultural codes.The premise of this thesis is the deconstruction of boundaries by highlighting therepeating grandmother rhythm. The established barriers serve to segregate works intogroups based on language, nationality, gender, and ethnicity. Therefore, reading alongthe restrictive lines established by the latter has disallowed the rich understanding thatan interdisciplinary study which crosses genre, gender, and lines of ethnicity reveals.","AI","Warwick University"
"The French Communist Party and French cinema 1944-1999.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/3061/","Marie, Laurent","April 2024","This dissertation examines the relationship between the French Communist Party (PCF) and French cinema between 1944 and 1999. The approach adopted is an historical and political one, exploring the context behind the changing relations between the Party and the film industry. Both institutions have played a crucial part in the weaving of the political and cultural fabric of the country throughout the period. For both the PCF and French cinema, the Liberation marked a new beginning and a new relationship with the French state. Looking closely at the French Communist outlets over four key periods - the Liberation and the Cold War, the New Republic, May '68 and the 1990s -, the evolution of the positions of the PCF regarding both film as an industry and film as an art-form is examined with particular emphasis on the links and the differences between the film policy advocated by the PCF and its critical discourse on French cinema. Since 1944 and PCF has kept a close watch on France's film industry, participating, from the Blum-Byrne agreements to the demonstrations against the MAI, in every battle for its defence. The unique blend of State involvement in film matters and professional resilience in the face of foreign competition which defines French cinema today owes much to this Communist involvement. Yet in spite of this continuous support the PCF has not left a strong mark on French cinema either in aesthetic or ideological terms, and the silver screen has hardly ever broadcast the PCF viewpoint. The reluctance shown by some in the Party to acknowledge the concept of auteur as well as the Party's own history serve to explain this absence. Until the 1980s, the PCF's discourse was dominated by the defence of France's national culture, although some Communist critics and auteurs disputed this vision tainted with economism.","AI","Warwick University"

"Shedding new light on the organization : an empirical analysis of some key aspects of business organizations.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/53071/","Delmastro, Marco","October 1999","There is a striking difference between the large number of theoreticalpapers on firm organization and the lack of quantitative empiricalevidence. If on the one side economists are increasingly concernedwith organization of firms, on the other side organization still remainsan ambiguous concept, hardly analyzed empirically.In this thesis I develop a new empirical methodology based uponbusiness history (see Chapter 1) and previous theoretical work whichallows me to describe (some aspects of) the organization of firms inquantitative terms. This approach is instrumental to analyzing thehierarchical structure and the allocation of decision-making activitiesin a sample composed of 438 Italian metalworking plants. I alsostudy the dynamics of firm organization in the 1980s and 1990s. Theresults of Chapter 2 show that the (static) choice of the organizationalform crucially relies upon the ""loss of control phenomenon"". Theyalso illustrate that the dynamics of hierarchical structure follows aninertial process, characterized by incremental adjustments. Lastly,both the organization and, more interestingly, its evolution differ fromone category of plant to another depending crucially on plant size.Moreover, I test (some of) the predictions of economic theory on thesize of the management hierarchy (Chapter 3), the allocation of realand formal authority (Chapter 4), and structural inertia (Chapter 6)through the estimates of econometric models (i. e., multinomial logit, ordered logit, and survival). The findings of Chapter 3 show that theplant size, the characteristics (i. e., vintage and extent of use) of theproduction and communication technology in use, the plant'sownership status (i. e., State versus private ownership, anddifferences in the nationality of firms to which plants belong) are keyin explaining the complexity of a plant's management hierarchy.In addition, in accordance with theoretical work, the findings ofChapter 4 show that the size of a plant's organization, thecharacteristics of the production and communication technologies inuse, the urgency of decisions, and the presence of monetary incentiveschemes aligning plant manager's objectives with those of the firm asa whole figure prominently in explaining whether authority isdelegated to the plant manager or not. The structural andorganizational characteristics of a plant's parent firm do also play arole, with the likelihood of decentralization of decision-makingincreasing with parent firm's size and decreasing with the adoptionby the parent firm of a M-form type of organization. Lastly, the natureof the decision turns out to affect the allocation of formal authority,with decisions concerning the labor force being more frequentlydelegated to plant managers than those related to investments incapital equipment. On the contrary, it does not influence theallocation of real authority when the formal right to decide remainswith the corporate superior. Finally in Chapter 61 find that both influence activities andtechnology adoptions are key in explaining the evolution of businessorganizations. Influence activities tend to inhibit organizationalchange causing structural inertia, whilst the technology adoptionsincrease the likelihood of changing the structure of the managementhierarchy.","AI","Warwick University"

"Divisional strategy : value creation and relatedness within the multidivisional firm.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4287/","Smith, Christopher S.","July 1999","From an economic perspective the value of a group of related businesses under onemanagement is derived from the potential for synergy, based on the exploitation ofunderlying economies of scope. To realise this inherent economic value,organisational theorists have argued that a purposively cooperative pattern ofstructures, systems and processes must be put in place. Divisions of modemmultidivisional companies are internal, quasi-corporations of related businesses and,as such, theoretical economic/organisational rationales would posit divisions ascooperative enterprises.Using a sample of divisions purposively chosen to comprise businesses that werehighly related, this thesis set out to explore the extent to which divisional managingdirectors expressed views and initiated organisational dynamics consistent with acooperative perspective. Semi-structured interviews with senior divisional personnelin 12 divisions and with business and functional level staff in 2 of these provided theprime source of data which served as a basis from which a case study was written foreach division. The cases were analysed in terms of the membership benefits (value)the divisional managing director was attempting to optimise for the componentbusinesses and the extent to which he expressed a cooperative orientation and wasoverseeing cooperative structures, processes and systems.Two categories of division are identified. The 'cooperative' grouping is consistentwith the theoretical view of economies of scope and cooperative structures but alarger number of divisions are categorised as 'non-cooperative' with perspectives,systems etc. consistent with a traditional M-form orientation of autonomous, non-interactingbusinesses.Reasons for this mismatch of theory and practice are discussed with the existence ofnon-cooperative divisions being explained as the consequence of a variety oforganisational contingencies. Implications for divisional management and practice inmultidivisional firms are suggested.","AI","Warwick University"

Through a study of each of these major centres, the issues of workshop identityand stylistic trendsetters are considered.It is shown how the interpretation of documentary evidence has impeded anunderstanding of these buildings, which can be revealed by an analysis of the fabric. Basedprimarily on a methodology of buildings archaeology and assessment of moulding profiles,traditional assumptions concerning the chronology and patronage are challenged.The new chronology for works at Sherborne Abbey, and the redating of thecommencement of Bath Abbey further our understanding of the nature of masons'workshops, patronage and stylistic development within a regional context. Introspection inmasons' workshops during the 15th century, and retrospection in later design in the region,demonstrates a reliance on the innovations of the 14th century, and the significance of theparish church tradition in the region, respectively. The thesis concludes with a discussion onthe influence of major church workshops on domestic architecture, and the impact of thedissemination of the lodges in the early 16th century.","AI","Warwick University"

"The interpreter as intercultural mediator.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2548/","Makarová, Viera","August 1998","This thesis looks at the role of the Slovak-English interpreter working in the consecutive mode in the business environment especially with regard to rendering cultural references from source texts, whether these are (British) English or Slovak. Since culture in this thesis is taken in the broad sense of the whole way of life, cultural references can also be wide-ranging. The strategy an interpreter will opt for when interpreting cultural references depends on the circumstances under which he or she operates. Interpreting puts constraints on interpreters which make their activity distinct from translation of written texts, where in cases of unknown cultural references, translators can resort to the use of notes. Interpreters are engaged in mediating communication between (two) clients who do not share the same language and who come from differing cultural backgrounds. Due to differences between the (British) English and the Slovak cultures - in their material, spiritual and behavioural aspects - as well as due to lack of knowledge of cultural references which the clients of English-Slovak interpreting have and which was caused historically, some intercultural mediation is needed. Its particular forms are the outcome of the weighing of the circumstances under which the English-Slovak consecutive interpreter works. Moreover, business interpreting contains challenges in the form of the vocabulary of business, a relatively new area for Slovak interpreters. An interpreter, under all the above mentioned constraints, has to fulfil his or her role: to establish and maintain communication between the two parties. Therefore some of the strategies used will try to prevent miscommunication, while others will try to deal with miscommunication once it has occurred.","AI","Warwick University"
"French colonial discourses : the case of French Indochina 1900-1939.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/35581/","Cooper, Nicola","September 1997","This thesis focuses upon French colonial discourses at the height of theFrench imperial encounter with Indochina: 1900-1939. It examines the way inwhich imperial France viewed her role in Indochina, and the representations andperceptions of Indochina which were produced and disseminated in a variety ofcultural media emanating from the metropole. Framed by political, ideological andhistorical developments and debates, each chapter develops a socio-culturalaccount of France's own understanding of her role in Indochina, and herrelationship with the colony during this crucial period.The thesis asserts that although consistent, French discourses of Empiredo not present a coherent view of the nation's imperial identity or role, and thatthis lack of coherence is epitomised by the Franco-indochinese relationship. Thethesis seeks to demonstrate that French perceptions of Indochina were markedabove all by a striking ambivalence, and that the metropole's view of the status ofIndochina within the Empire was often contradictory, and at times paradoxical.Indeed, the thesis argues that Indochina was imagined through a series ofantitheses which reflect the incoherent nature of French colonial discourse duringthis period.This thesis uses as its primary material a variety of key cultural mediawhich informed the popular perception of Indochina during this period:metropolitan and Franco-indochinese school manuals; the writings and designs ofFrench colonial urbanists; the works of influential colonial apologists; 'official'texts relating to the organisation and impact of the Exposition coloniale of 1931;travel journalism; and metropolitan fiction relating to Indochina. The discursiveapproach that this thesis takes, focusing clearly upon the socio-culturaldimension, should provide an important re-evaluation of French Indochina and itslegacy, and should make a contribution to the understanding of France's relationswith her colonial territories during the first half of the twentieth century.","AI","Warwick University"

"The films of Chantal Akerman : a cinema of displacements.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4048/","Fowler, Catherine","April 1993","This thesis attempts to broaden the critical boundaries within which the films ofChantal Akerman have been discussed. First, it extends analysis from Akerman's70s to her 80s and 90s films. Second, it argues that as well as her gender andaesthetic identities, Akerman's Belgian and Jewish identities should beacknowledged. Finally, it suggests that each of these four identities: woman,independent film-maker, Belgian and Jewish allow her a position of marginality,figured in her films through the trope of 'displacement'.The structure of the thesis is two-fold: it extends discussion of Akerman's cinema tofilms not previously considered, and through this extension engages withcontemporary issues in film and cultural theory such as female authorship,independent and national, and marginal cinemas. Chapter one `Woman' and chaptertwo `Independent' extend the reading of gender and sexuality and formal andaesthetic innovation in Akerman's cinema. In the first chapter this is done throughconsideration of the films Golden Eighties (1986) and Nuit et jour (1990), while inthe second her short films, video work and work for television are examined.My third and fourth chapters offer areas of Akerman's work which have notpreviously been studied. Chapter three, `Belgian', considers the significance ofAkerman's nationality for her film-making while engaging with theories aroundnational cinema. It examines the possibility of a `Belgian national cinema' and theintersections which arise between this and Akerman's cinema, especially aroundToute une nuit (1982). Finally, in my fourth chapter, `Jewish', I use Histoiresd'Amerigue (1989) and D'Est (1993) to argue that Akerman's is a `wandering'cinema, in which she is constantly examining the homelessness and displacementthat her Jewishness engenders.","AI","Warwick University"
"Non-contact ultrasonic study on thixotropic alloys.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/34704/","Idris, Azmi","January 1995","Thixotropic metals have better fluid flow behaviour in the semi-solid statewhen compared to conventional metals and have been increasingly used commerciallyfor the production of high quality engineering components using the technique ofthixoforming. However in industrial production, there is no proper quality controlsystem available at present to monitor the softness or to estimate the percentage ofsolid/liquid fractions of the metal before it is forged into the required shapes. Due tothe existence of a temperature gradient within the sample when heated in the RXfurnace a bulk measurement is needed.This thesis examines the capability of non-contact ultrasound to make acousticwave measurements in to the semi-solid state. In particular we have identified pulsedlaser generation and EMAT reception as being the most appropriate approach. TheNd: YAG laser has proved capable of generating broadband ultrasound and awater-cooled spiral coil permanent magnet EMAT an efficient detector of both shearand longitudinal waves. The system enables both the longitudinal and shear waves tobe detected simultaneously. Investigations have been conducted on various thixotropicmetals ranging from lower melting temperature Al-Si alloys (≃570°C) to the highermelting point M2 tool steel (≃1200°C). A Cu-Sn alloy that has a melting temperatureof around 830°C was also used for the investigation. Due to the high price anddifficulty in obtaining the thixotropic materials preliminary measurements were carriedout on non-thixotropic Al-Si alloys and a commercial mild steel. A water-cooled shearEMAT, furnace systems and an ultrasonic cell have been designed and constructed forthe thesis. The experiment was carried out in a through transmission arrangement withthe laser and the EMAT on epicentre. The experimental work is presented in chapters4 to 6. Chapter 4 covers the investigation on the Al-Si alloys, chapter 5 coversinvestigations on the higher melting point materials, and chapter 6 presentsinvestigations into the efficiency of the chosen laser-EMAT system and analysessystematic errors.The laser-EMAT system has proved capable of making measurements not onlyin the partially molten state but also in the fully molten state with sample temperaturesup to 1140°C. The sudden drop in the longitudinal wave to shear wave transit timeratio indicates that the onset of melting could be detected. Since the ratio depends onlyon the temperature and the percentage of solid and liquid present in the sample and isindependent of the sample dimensions it could be a suitable parameter for monitoringthe percentage of liquid/solid fractions necessary for thixoforging. However work hasyet to be carried out in the industrial environment to prove the capability of the systemin monitoring the softness of the metal during thixoforming.","AI","Warwick University"

"Pre- and post-prandial human scalp-EEG response to olfactory  stimulation, using the brain electrical activity mapping technique.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/136112/","Martin, G. Neil","February 1994","Recent psychophysiological evidence indicates that Central Nervous System activity may be directly affected by olfactory stimulation. The present thesis sought to examine the relationship between the CNS and olfactory perception in a series of three EEG experiments employing food odours as stimuli. Further aims were to explore the effect of food ingestion on psychophysiological behaviour and on the hedonic rating of odours, and to investigate the relationship between odour's affective valence and EEG asymmetry. The areas relating to olfactory psychology are reviewed in detail. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of the ingestion of a lunchtime meal and ambient food odour on the auditory oddball evoked potential. Marked P2(K) amplitude changes were associated with exposure to odour. In most cases, decreases in amplitude were obtained depending on the nature of the stimulus. Effects of meal ingestion were also found for P2(X) with the lunch group showing greater amplitude during the second (post-prandial) session than the unfed control group. A three-way interaction was obtained with the controls showing a significant decrease in P2(X) amplitude during the presentation of the odour of vegetable in the second session in comparison to the lunch group. No effect of odour on P300 amplitude was found. Experiments 2 and 3 examined EEG response to a variety of different actual and synthetic food odorants. Both experiments showed alterations in the theta frequency (in experiment 2, exclusively so). The effect of meal ingestion was variable with controls showing greater alpha activity than the lunch group during the second session in one experiment, but the opposite effect in the other. No alpha-related EEG asymmetry for pleasant or unpleasant odours was found in experiment 2 although asymmetries were obtained for the theta frequency. In experiment 3, however, intra-hemispheric alpha asymmetry was obtained for the most pleasant odour. No effect of lunch was found for the postprandial psychometric rating of food odour suggesting that negative olfactory alliesthesia may not be as robust a phenomenon as gustatory alliesthesia. The hypothesis is put forward that the dominant EEG frequency for the processing of olfactory information is the theta frequency. It is suggested, however, that the effects found in this waveband may be related to the psychometric properties of the odour such as distractability and not due to the odour per se.","AI","Warwick University"

This study takesplace against and draws upon a wealth of material that has contributed to what is now aconsiderable body of knowledge but which has also left gaps in our understanding of theways in which probation reports are constituted and constructed and the implications of thisto the wider administration of justice.Empirical accounts of probation reports have largely consisted of documentary analyses orquantitative data. The inherent partiality of these approaches has meant that reports havebeen artifically decontextualised from their operational moorings.Probation practice has been theoretically located along a care-control continuum that hasreflected the historical evolution of sentencing strategies and state intervention into welfarepractice.The aim of this thesis is to present a contextualised account of probation reports. In order tounravel and reveal the processes, philosophies and strategies related to report writing and toaddress the impact of these in the judicial arena, the study was conducted from a groundedobservational perspective that acknowledges the complexities of report compilation at theinteractive, organisational and systems levels.In adopting this approach it is clear that the care-control model that has been applied to otherareas of probation practice is not necessarily conducive to the practice of report compilationbecause whilst it applies to the role of the probation officer in relation to supervisingoffenders, it is not readily transferable to the relationship that exists between report writersand sentencers. This relationship is extremely important to both the impact and the contentof reports, to the extent that the offender becomes incidental. as opposed to central, to thefinal document if not to the process. I suggest therefore that, whilst different areas of probation practice are not mutually exclusive, probation reports might be understood in termsof a role-function model.The role of the report writer and the function of the report emanate from an historical contextthat continues to have an impact on contemporary probation practice but which has rarelybeen the object of study at an operational level. This thesis attempts to redress the theoreticaland empirical balance by adopting a qualitative approach that incorporates an historicalperspective into the analysis.","AI","Warwick University"
"Optimal taxation, imperfect competition and tax enforcement policies.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4492/","Galmarini, Umberto","July 1993","This thesis contains four papers in the area of Public Economics.Chapter 1 looks at producers' taxation in a model of vertically related oligopolies.Both ad valorem and specific taxes are considered and formulae expressing their effectson prices and profits are derived, showing how these depend on factors such as demandconditions, technology and market structure. Conditions for taxation to cause priceovershifting and to raise profits are given. Also, tax instruments are compared in termsof the amount of revenue collected and the effect on the price for the final good.Chapter 2 applies the results of the previous paper to the analysis of tax reforms.Vertically related oligopolies result in welfare loss for two reasons. Firstly, upstreamoligopolists set the price of the intermediate good above marginal cost and this causesaggregate production inefficiency. Secondly, downstream oligopolists introduce an additionalprice-cost margin. The analysis focuses on tax reforms, where the governmentaims at reducing the welfare loss by levying taxes and subsidies on producers whileraising no revenue.Chapter 3 focuses on the design of income tax enforcement policies in a principalagentframework. The existing literature assumes risk neutral taxpayers while thischapter considers the case of risk averse agents by assuming a kinked linear utilityfunction. When individuals have the same attitude towards risk, it is shown that theoptimal policy is such that income reports below a given threshold are audited at theprobability level just sufficient to induce truthful reporting, whereas those above it arenot audited. This makes the effective tax schedule to be quite regressive. Instead,if attitudes towards risk vary across taxpayers, the numerical results show that theoptimal audit policy causes only a limited regressive bias, for income reports above thethreshold meet a positive probability of audit.Chapter 4 examines the Presumptive Income Coefficients (PIC) audit policy, ascheme recently introduced in the Italian tax code and aimed at reducing tax evasionin the non-corporate sector. The tax agency applies the PIC to observable productioncosts to get an estimate of taxpayer's income, or presumptive income. The probabilityof audit is then dependent on the gap between presumptive and reported income.This issue is examined in a setting where the game between the taxing authority andtaxpayers is modelled in a principal-agent framework.","AI","Warwick University"

As a consequence, the splitting is usually a delicate balance between several competing mechanisms. A typical example is the splitting of the *S?/2 ground state of Gd3* ions in lanthanum ethylsulphate (GdES), and over the years a great deal of effort has been expanded in trying to get agreement with experimental data. The result of these efforts is a theoretical splitting which is around 20% greater than the experimental splittings. In addition, they suggest that the splitting is Independent of temperature, yet it is well known that the splitting exhibits a particularly interesting temperature dependence. The reason for this is that the existing mechanisms are calculated on the assumption that the lattice is stationary, and of course this is unrealistic, even at absolute zero.","AI","Warwick University"

"Comparing men and times : the classical sources and the political  significance of Ben Jonsons ""Sejanus"" and ""Catiline"" in early Jacobean and Restoration England.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/34762/","Alyo, Muhammed W.","December 1992","The primary objective of this thesis is to examine the interaction between drama andpolitics in Ben Jonson's two surviving tragedies, Sejanus and Catiline, during theearly years of the Jacobean and Restoration periods. Jonson relied heavily onclassical scholarship in writing his two extant tragedies, his stated reason being toconvince the readers of their ""truth of Argument"". But Jonson, nevertheless,adapted his sources in an ingenious way that both suited his dramatic purposes andserved to cast light on social and political realities in the England of his own day.For Jonson, as for many Renaissance historians, the past had meaning primarilybecause of its valuable lessons for the present and the future. Thus, one of my aimsis to examine both the nature and the extent of Jonson's dependenceo n the classicalsources which provided him with the historical stories and details that he dramatizedin the two plays. SuccessiveE nglish governmentsi n the seventeenthc entury treateddrama, especially that based on historical material, as a potentially dangerousmedium for disseminating propaganda and for influencing public opinion againstspecific government policies. Therefore, part of this work will be devoted todiscussing censorship regulations within early Jacobean and Restoration England,and to examining their effects both on Jonson and on the reception of his twotragedies. Each of the two plays is studied in the context of its historical sources inorder to determine Jonson's method of adapting his sources as well as the extent oftopicality that each play seems to provide, both on the Jacobean and the Restorationstage. The method adopted in this study is to place the two Roman tragedies withinthe contemporary setting for which they were originally intended and then withinthe context of the early Restoration period when the two plays are thought to havebeen revived.","AI","Warwick University"
"Studies on pyruvate decarboxylase-catalysed acyloin formation and the effects of surfactants on lipase-catalysed hydrolysis of esters.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/110304/","Bornemann, Stephen","July 1992","The effect of surfactants on the hydrolysis of achiral and chiral substrates by crude and purified porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL; EC 3.1.1.3) has been studied. Rather than accelerating the reactions, surfactants slowed down (""inhibited"") the reactions relative to the rate in the absence of surfactant, despite effective emulsification of the substrate. Surfactants varied in the extent to which the reaction was inhibited and inhibition occurred below the critical micelle concentration of surfactants. Inhibition was accompanied by a loss of enantioselectivity with the crude enzyme but not the purified enzyme, indicating the presence of more than one activity in the crude PPL preparation. In general, there would seem to be no advantage to be gained from the use of surfactants in the hydrolysis of compounds of low water solubility with lipolytic enzymes; the use of an immiscible cosolvent is more effective.","AI","Warwick University"

"End-plate connections and analysis of semi-rigid steel frames.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4248/","Benterkia, Zoubir","October 1991","The thesis examines the behaviour of end-plate connections and the related topic ofanalysis of unbraced semi-rigid steel plane frames with criteria for their design.The static moment-rotation behaviour is investigated for connections consisting ofbolted flexible end-plates, flush and extended end-plates, between I-section members,where the beams frame into the flanges of the columns. Attention is focussed onmoment-rotation characteristics as this is the most important influence on theresponse of either individual members or complete frames. The non-linear nature ofthese characteristics is identified and methods of representing moment-rotation curvesfor subsequent use in analytical procedures are presented. A data base for suchtypes of connection is created.An established computer program for second-order frame analysis has been extendedto frames with semi-rigid connections. Successive estimates are made of the secantstiffness of these connections to represent their effect on frame behaviour. Theanalysis program has been used to study the effects of semi-rigid joints on framebehaviour.Studies have been carried out to extend the Merchant-Rankine formula for theassessment of the ultimate load of frames with semi-rigid joints over the applicationrange of which was until now restricted to frames with rigid joints.A parameter entitled 'degree of flexibility' is introduced as a measure of the effectof semi-rigid joints on the stiffness of the frame. Within the limits of the study, itis demonstrated that the second-order effects will not be significant if the semi-rigidelastic critical load exceeds ten times the design load, and the degree of flexibilityis less than 50%. This last requirement was satisfied by extended end-platebeam-to-column connections. It has also been found that, under combined loading,the serviceability limit on sway is likely to control design, rather than ultimatestrength.Based on experimental and theoretical studies, it is recommended that the BS5950simplified method should permit 20% end-restraint, which would improve significantlythe attractiveness of the method.","AI","Warwick University"

Namely, thebehaviour of firms in Korea competing with firms in an industrializedcountry after all Government intervention of the former is withdrawn.This aspect is considered in the main part while a descriptiveintroductory part introduces the Korean economy as a NIC.We construct a simple asymmetric duopoly model where firms conjecturesplay an important role in deriving the Perfect Equilibrium for a twostage game. Different costs of production and first mover advantageform the basis of the asymmetry. We find that under Cournotconjectures assumption for the marketing stage and certain costconditions, it is profitable for the incumbent firm to stay a leaderand the follower to remain a follower. For some cost conditions and acredible threat at the disposal of the follower, the incumbent firmmay be forced to stay a leader even though it is more profitable tobecame a follower.We examine possible licensing rules the leader may propose to thefollower. The dominant strategy, we find, is a licence fee that is afunction of the quality difference between the top quality of themarket leader and the level of quality it is selling to the follower.There will be a cost to the leader in terms of a lower licence fee toprevent possible leap forgging. Once we allow for free copying, wefind that the follower will copy closely the new product of theleadership. Under Bertrand conjectures assumption, we find thatunless the firm with higher production cost remains the leaderoffering a higher quality product, it will be driven out of themarket, i. e., either it has to innovate or-die.","AI","Warwick University"

"Aspects of inequality and poverty in Greece, 1974, 1982.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/55889/","Tsakloglou, Panos","April 1989","This study attempts to document the state and nature of inequality and poverty in Greece using theprimary consumption expenditure data of two Household Expenditure Surveys conducted in 1974 and 1982.Chapter 1 provides an outline of recent developments in the Greek economy, a survey of the literatureon inequality and poverty in Greece and a comparison of the above data with data from other sources.In Chapter 2 it is argued that the distribution of consumption expenditure per equivalent adult is afairly good approximation to the (unobservable) distribution of economic welfare, and three models ofequivalence scales for the cost of children are estimated. Based on these results, the distributions ofconsumption expenditure per equivalent adult are constructed for both survey years.Chapter 3 provides the results of measurement and decomposition of inequality. One-waydecomposition is carried out when the population is grouped according to ten factors, of which five are used tosubdivide the population into small homogeneous socioeconomic groups for the purposes of the multivariatedecomposition of inequality. The main finding of the one-way decompositions is that disparities ""between groups""play a far less important role in determining aggregate inequality than disparities ""within-groups"".Even in the multivariate decomposition, variations ""between-groups"" account for only one third of aggregateinequality in 1974 and for even less in 1982.The results of measuremenat nd decompositiono f poverty, reportedi n Chapter4 , suggest that povertyis closely associated with certain occupational characteristics of the household head. These characteristics areemployment in the agricultural sector or no employment. Households headed by farmers and retired personsaccount for around two thirds of aggregate poverty in both survey years.Intertemporal changesi n inequality and poverty are examined in Chapter5 . It is demonstrated thatinequality and relative poverty declined substantially between 1974 and 1982, while the decline in absolutepoverty was spectacular. The impact on inequality of changes in the structure of the population wasnegligible, but the improvement in the educational level of HH heads had a strong negative effect on poverty.Further, the results of some cross-country inequality and welfare comparisons presented in this chapter showthat inequality is higher, and welfare lower, in Greece than in most of the other EEC countries.Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the principal findings and discusses briefly their policy implications","AI","Warwick University"
"Grotesque and excremental humour : Monty Pythons meaning of life.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/34722/","Ūdris, Jānis","April 1993","The thesis represents an attempt to bring together theoreticaland empirical work on (grotesque/excremental) humour. The first twosections are consequently concerned with the history and theorisationof the grotesque/excremental and with the prevalent ways ofanalysing the comedic. It was decided that a 'history' of MontyPython would constitute too long a digression, and so only a briefaccount of Terry Gilliam's links with the grotesque is included.Two further section then deal with some of the research on thecomedic which has been done and with audience research methodologies.It is worth noting a shift which took place in the course ofwork on this thesis, from a concern with highly individuatedresponses (reflecting the centrality of psychoanalytic explicationsof the comedic) to an eventual decision to concentrate on a 'readerresponse'approach. The rationale for this shift is discussed inSection 5, and briefly in Section 6.The empirical heart of the research is, then, an analysis of atranscript of six hours of taped interviews/discussions aboutresponses to Monty Python's Meaning of Life. These are supplementedby the results of Humour Appreciation Tests and Mood Adjective CheckLists administered under standard conditions to the respondentswatching the film.While there can be no question of 'proof', particularly in afield in which psychoanalytic mechanisms are arguably crucial,results of the empirical study indicate that the humour of Meaningof Life functions to reduce anxiety, and that the mechanism by whichthis occurs conforms to a Freudian repression model. Over and abovethis, however, - the work of David Morley and Janice Radway is worthevoking here - the detailed account of audience response also furnishesdata for further enquiry about how and why 'real' respondentsdo or do not find grotesque and excremental humour 'funny'.","AI","Warwick University"
"The Guénégaud Theatre 1673-1680 and the machine plays of Thomas Corneille.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/3965/","Clarke, Jan","April 2000","The Guénégaud theatre was in operation in Paris from 1673 to1680 - from shortly after Molière's death to the foundation of theComedie-Frangaise. Although the first home of both the Paris Opera andthe Comedie-Frangaise, the Guénégaud has attracted little attention, andno previous study has been devoted entirely to it, despite the fact thatthe Guénégaud account books are preserved in the Archives of theComedie-Francaise. These have provided a wealth of information on theday-to-day running of a seventeenth-century French theatre and thepreparation of productions. What is more, a study of the records ofticket sales they contain has been found to make possible not only ananalysis of the tastes and, to a certain extent, the composition of theGuénégaud's audiences, but also a reconstruction of the theatre buildingitself.In 1673, the Guénégaud company was in a highly vulnerableposition. Just seven years later, however, it was so powerful and inpossession of a theatre so well-equipped, - that it was the ancient andprestigious Hotel de Bourgogne company that was closed down and itsactors transferred to the Guénégaud to form the Comedie-Francaise. Thisthesis, therefore, further examines how the Guénégaud company succeededin effecting this reversal in their fortunes.One major contributing factor was the Guénégaud company'sseries of machine plays by Thomas Corneille and Donneau De Vise.Concentrating on Circe, the first and most successful of these, as asingle representative production, this thesis, is also, therefore, astudy of the adaptation and final demise of a genre where music was ofprimary importance in the face of implacable opposition from Lully,desirous of protecting his privilege on the production of operas.Finally, the thesis attempts to show that if there is anyjustification in the tradition by which the Comedie-Frangaise is knownas the 'Maison de Moliere', this is entirely due to the Guénégaudcompany's success in ensuring their own survival and, in so doing,maintaining and transmitting their inheritance from Moliere's troupe,and that this same survival was in no small part thanks to the machineplays of Thomas Corneille.","AI","Warwick University"

It includes his clandestine wartime publications, the subsequent development of his theory of human 'rebellion', with its strong ethical connotations, and the various polemical and fictional texts in which, in the post-war period, he expresses support for communist aims and for progressive causes such as anticolonialism. Vercors's chairmanship of the CNE in the mid-1950's is examined through his memoirs as well as through his articles and speeches of the time. After the author's overt withdrawal from fellow-travelling in 1957, his more selective political commitment is traced through the remaining years of the Algerian conflict, while the memoirs and other works of reflection that have appeared in the latter part of his career recapitulate the overall development of his political attitudes and reveal certain changes of view. Vercors's more general theory of human value has, on the other hand, remained constant, and he offers it as a starting- point for better understanding between men of all nations and ideologies.","AI","Warwick University"

Milled glass powder wasmade into thin sheet form by a doctor blading technique and, oncedried, the copper screen printed on top. After lamination andfiring, the conductor was completely encapsulated by the cordieritematrix. Copper diffusion occ~red with metallic copper precipitatingout although a small denuded zone was evident around the peripheryof the conductor. This was due to compositional changes occurringthere.Experiment showed that the effects of glass particle shape,average size and size distribution lead to deviation in theshrinking of compacts from the theoretical sintering curves. Anunstable ~ phase was the first to appear on the glass particlesurfaces although another, unidentifiable phase, was also found toexist during the very early stages of crystallization. This wasfollowed shortly after by bulk crystallization of ~ cordieritein the remaining glass, possibly being aided by a prior phaseseparation. Further heat treatment lead to the transformationto a cordie rite and the formation of enstatite, the exacttransformation temperature depending upon the minor oxide additivesin the glass. At temperatures above ~10500C protoenstatite formedand lead to a general degradation in material properties.The benefit from having a cordie rite as the principal phaseis a low dielectric constant (5.35) and loss angle (5 x 10-4),reasonable strength (130 MPa) and high resistivity (~1015 Qcm).This makes it a suitable replacement for alumina although its lowthermal conductivity (~2 Wm-lK-l) is a drawback. By adjusting theMgO/A1203 ratio, the material could be expansion matched to thatof silicon.","AI","Warwick University"
"Confirmation bias and the testing of hypotheses about other people.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/4040/","Burchell, Brendan","September 1986","Critical reviews of the literatures on self-fulfillingprophecies and self-confirming hypotheses uncovered severalweaknesses in key works on those topics. In particular twoimportant flaws were revealed. Hypotheses and expectationswere confused and confounded and the most important aspect ofthese effects in person perception, changes in the perceiver's representation of the target, were ignored. Insteadthese works either made inferences about the perceivers'judgments from other individuals with different perspectives,or claimed to have demonstrated the effect of manipulatingthe hypothesis whereas their results were probably attributableto manipulating expectancies instead. It was arguedthat both of these types of inferences are invalid, and reanalysesof data from empirical works showed that the claimswere not justified.A series of experiments was conducted in an attempt tofind unequivocal evidence of self-confirming hypotheses.Numerous reasons were found as to why the phenomenon washighly unlikely to occur in social interaction. Forinstance, the asking of biased questions was found not tooccur when perceivers generated their own questions to askinstead of selecting from a list given to them. In addition,subjects modified the questions they asked during the courseof social interactions in such a way as to eliminate anypossible bias in information search. Even when questionssearching for confirmatory evidence were asked there waslittle evidence that interviewers' judgements were biased infavour of confirming their hypotheses.By contrast strong evidence was found for self-confirminghypotheses when subjects used information fromtheir own memories to test hypotheses about aquaintances.These findings were discussed in the light of otherparadigms within social psychology. Reasons why socialcognition has, at times, so underestimated human rationalitywere considered and several conclusions were made includingthe need for greater caution in attempting to emulate andunderstand social processes in a laboratory setting.","AI","Warwick University"
"John Ford and his circle : coterie values and the language of Fords theatre.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/58519/","Hopkins, Lisa","April 2000","This thesis attempts an analysis of some of the major themes and characteristics in Ford's work in the light of the interests and concerns of his dedicatees. The first part, after a discussion of the Ford canon and its chronology, considers four prominent aspects of his writing. The first chapter examines the dislike evinced by many of his characters for food, and the second the distrust of language so frequently registered in his work, and the way in which this leads ultimately to the writing of unsatisfactory plays. The next chapter then goes on to suggest that these two elements of Ford's plays may perhaps be linked by his perception of personality as fragmentarily located in disparate parts of the body, all exerting conflicting claims to represent the totality of the self. The last chapter of the first half of the thesis is concerned with the attempt in The Broken Heart to find an alternative, nonverbal means of communication, and also examines the possibility that the feeling conveyed in Ford's plays of the unsatisfactoriness of physical food may be connected with the sense of spiritual starvation in The Broken Heart. It is further suggested that this in turn might perhaps reflect a preference on Ford's part for the Catholic rather than the Anglican communion.","AI","Warwick University"

"Adolescents understanding of limits and infinity.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/34626/","Monaghan, J.","July 1986","AIM To investigate mathematically able adolescents' conceptions ofthe basic notions behind the Calculus: infinity (including theinfinitely large, the infinitely small and infinite aggregates);limits (of sequences, series and functions); and real numbers. Toobserve the effect, if any, on these conceptions, of a one yearcalculus course.EXPERIMENTS Pilot interviews and questionnaires helped identifyareas on which to focus the study. A questionnaire was administered toLower Sixth Form students with 0-level mathematics passes. Thequestionnaire was administered twice, once in September and again thefollowing May. The A-level mathematicians had received instruction inmost of the techniques of the Calculus by May.Interviews, to clarify ambiguities, elicit reasoning behind theresponses and probe typicality and atypicality, were conducted in themonth following each administration.A second questionnaire, an amended version of the first, wasadministered to a larger but similar audience. The responses wereanalysed in the light of hypotheses formulated in the analysis of datafrom the first 5ample.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Subjects have a concept of infinity. It existsmainly as a process, anything that goes on and on. It may exist as anobject, as a large number or the cardinality of a set, but in theseforms it is a vague and indeterminate form. The concept of infinity isinherently contradictory and labile.Recurring decimals are perceived as dynamic, not static, entitiesand are not proper numbers. Similar attitudes exist towardsinfinitesimals when they are seen to exist. Subjects' conception ofthe continuum do not conform to classical or nonstandard paradigms.Convergence / divergence properties are generally noted withinfinite sequences and functions. With infinite series, however,convergence / divergence properties, when observed, are seen assecondary to the fact that any infinite series goes on indefinitelyand is thus similar to any other infinite series.The concept that the hut is the saue type of entitiy as thefinite tens is strong in subjects' thoughts. We coin the termgeneric hiuit for this phenomenon. The generic limit of 0.9, 0.99,is 0.9, not 1. Similarly the reasoning scheme that whatever holds forthe finite holds for the infinite has widespread application. We cointhe term generic law for this scheme.Many of the phrases used in calculus courses (in particular hut,tends to, approaches and converges) have everyday meanings thatconflict with their mathematical definitions.Numeric/geometric, counting/measuring and static/dynamic contextualinfluences were observed in some areas.The first year of a calculus course has a negligible effect onstudents conceptions of limits, infinity and real numbers.IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING On introducing limits teachers shouldencourage full class discussion to ensure that potential cognitiveobstacles are brought out into the open. Teachers should take greatcare that their use of language is understood. A-level courses shoulddevote more of their time to studying the continuum. Nonstandardanalysis is an unsuitable tool for introducing elementary calculus.","AI","Warwick University"

Anexamination of Paulhan's role, and of his editorial policy(Chapter One) precedes the identification of a number of themes.Already sensitive to topical questions, the NRF debated the roleand responsibilities of the intellectuals (Chapter Two), whoseattitudes tended to become more politicized as they grew moreaware of the deficiencies of the Third Republic (Chapter Three).Their preoccupations reflected major themes, in particularFranco-German relations (Chapter Four), Franco-Soviet relations(Chapter Five), and the Jewish question (Chapter Six). Of coursethe writers involved with the NRF continued to consider politicaland international issues in the light of their own preferencesand prejudices.; yet their reactions and interpretations show thatthey were ever-more conscious of the crucial, historical importanceof the period. Indeed its nature was such that History forced theNRF, eventually, into adopting a partisan position which wasAntifascist, anti-Munich, and which even prefigured the Resistance(Chapter Seven).","AI","Warwick University"

"Jean Guéhenno : an inter-war intellectual.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/55881/","Librowski, Stanisław Jan","October 1985","The study of Jean Guehenno in the inter-war years is dividedinto three main parts. The first deals with the development ofGw!henno's personality and ideas, which preceded the publicationof his major works, and explores his debt to certain literaryfigures. The second deals with the main texts Caliban parleand Journal d'un homme de 40 ans, whilst the third explores hisrole as editor and director of Europe and Vendredi respectively.The first chapters consider the difficulties Guehenno encounteredin reconciling academic success with his poor origins. Moreover theypresent the problem of his experience of the First World War, hisdecision to become a teacher and the influence of Daniel Halevyin his early literary career.The second part is an analysis of Guehenno's two most importanttexts. With respect to Caliban parle the issues raised includeco-existence in a world without God, the solution of a contractualsociety with all its implications for culture, and the problem ofrevolution as a personal spiritual ideal. In the case of Journald'un homme de 40 ans, where Guehenno reaffirms his earlierindividualism, his discovery of a style to suit his intellectualpreoccupations is considered, as is the fact that his work isprimarily a personal protest against war.The third section of the thesis deals with Guehenno's role inEurope as well as in Vendredi and with the extent to which thesepapers reflected the interests of his major works. Furthermore,in the case of Vendredi the problem of the confrontation betweenidealism and political necessity posed by ""engagement"" is examined,using Guehenno's articles on the Front Populaire and the U.S.S.R.The conclusions drawn are that Guehenno is an importantinfluential and representative member of the group of ""intellectuelsengages"" which worked in France in the inter-war years, because hiswork raises their common problems of intellectuality, class, cultureand pacifism. Equally importantly however, his case illustratesthe dangers posed by intellectual commitment to a political cause -dangers which led him to adopt an ultimately conservative position,and which on a more general level led to the dispersal of the""intellectuels engages"" as a group.","AI","Warwick University"

"Commercial policy and industrialisation in Nigeria, 1963-1978.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/34674/","Sagagi, A. Muhammad","April 1960","As a contribution to the continuing debate among trade anddevelopment economists as to the role of industrial strategiesin the pattern of economic development, this study analyses theexperience of one developing country, Nigeria, with an importsubstitution strategy. The performance of the industrial sectoris critically assessed and related to the trade policy adopted.Using published data, the study covers 24 industries and a periodof 16 years, beginning 1963 and extending to 1978.An analysis of the structure of protection reveals a considerablyhigh and wide ranging levels of effective protection,in favour of consumer-goods oriented sectors. The relationshipbetween these rates of effective protection on the one hand andimport substitution and sectoral growth on the other was examinedusing various parametric and non-parametric tests of association.The evidence, which is only suggestive in nature, indicates thatthe structure of protection does play a role, albeit a minimalone, in stimulating industrial growth.Using Input-Output techniques, the employment, foreign exchangeand output implications of the present strategy of Import-Substitution and of a hypothetical strategy of export promotionare analysed. There is a general absence of 'key' employmentsectors and, paradoxically, an export promotion strategy is foundto be less employment generating and more capital using but lessforeign exchangeusing than the existing strategy.Although there is a considerable scope for capital-laboursubstitution in many industries, it was found that the oftenrecommended policy of getting prices 'right' will not be sufficientto bring about an appreciable improvement in the employmentsituation.The development of factor productivity between 1963 and 1978for each of the 24 industries was analysed; and three possibledeterminants of productivity are investigated: capital intensityand technical progress, output growth (the Verdoorn's Law) andtrade policy. With regards to the latter, it was found thatperiods of especially slack productivity growth roughly correspondto those in which there was especially restrictive trade policyas quantified by high erps. The economic efficiency of the manufacturing sector was appraised using the criteria of net socialprofitability, social rate of return and Domestic Resources Costs(DRCs). Evidence was found in support of the hypothesis that theresource pull of protection to the protected industries isaccompanied by higher rates of private, but lower rates of socialprofitability for the more heavily protected sectors.The overall conclusion of the thesis is that the policies ofprotection should have been more rationally applied and the ISstrategy more rationally executed in line with the country'senunciated objectives.","AI","Warwick University"
"Metric domains for completeness.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/60775/","Matthews, Stephen G.","April 1976","Completeness is a semantic non-operational notion of program correctness suggested (but not pursued) by W.W.Wadge. Program verification can be simplified using completeness, firstly by removing the approximation relation from proofs, and secondly by removing partial objects from proofs. The dissertation proves the validity of this approach by demonstrating how it can work in the class of metric domains. We show how the use of Tarski's least fixed point theorem can be replaced by a non-operational unique fixed point theorem for many well behaved Programs. The proof of this theorem is also non-operational. After this we consider the problem of deciding what it means f or a function to be ""complete"". It is shown that combinators such as function composition are not complete, although they are traditionally assumed to be so. Complete versions for these combinators are given. Absolute functions are proposed as a general model for the notion of a complete function. The theory of mategories is introduced as a vehicle for studying absolute functions.","AI","Warwick University"

Observations indicate that several species co-exist in solutions of these compounds. The mixed compound (MgCl₂)3 TiCl₄  (SnCl₄)2 12 EtOAc was also prepared.The mixed titanium chloro-carboxylates TiClx (0₂CR) 4-x (x = 2, R = Me, CMe₃; x = 3, R = Me, CMe, Ph) were prepared and characterised. Hydrolysis reactions of these compounds in the solvents EtOAc and THF yielded compounds of the type [TiCl₂(0₂CR) L]₂0.  An X-ray crystallographic study of the compounds [TiCl₂(0₂CPh) L]₂0 showed that two titanium atoms are bridged by two carboxylate groups and an oxygen atom.Phosphine and amine complexes of the chlorides of titanium and zirconium were prepared and their reactions with reducing agents such as LiBH4 and sodium amalgam were studied in an attempt to prepare stabilized low oxidation state compounds of these elements. Hence some complexes of TiCl₄, TiCl₃, ZrCl₄ and (PhO)₂TiCl₂ with the ligands PEt₃, PBu₃,  DPPE, DMPE, DBPE and TMEDA were prepared and characterised using 1H and 31P n.m.r. spectroscopy.

"A study of the chemistry of nitrogen mustard by N.M.R. spectroscopy.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/113593/","Kebbell, Michael James","September 1984","This thesis describes the use of high-field n.m.r. spectroscopy, in part combined with stable isotope labelling, to study the solution chemistry of nitrogen mustard (2-chloro-(N-2-chloroethyl)-N-methylethanamine). Reactions with a range of nucleophiles were monitored by ¹H n.m.r. spectroscopy which demonstrated the generation of N-2-chloroethyl-N-methylaziridinium chloride from nitrogen mustard and step-wise substitution of nitrogen mustard except where polymerisation or hydrolysis occurred. The ¹H n.m.r. spectrum of the N-2-chloroethyl-N-methyl- aziridinium ion was resolved and fully assigned. The intermediacy of this species in reactions of nitrogen mustard is implied by experiments in which identical products are derived from a given nucleophile when added to either the aziridinium ion or the parent nitrogen mustard. Intermediacy of two successive aziridinium ions in alkylation of nucleophiles by nitrogen mustard was confirmed by examination of the 13c label distribution in products arising from alkylation of [2,2'-13c]-2-chloro-(N-2-chloro- ethyl)-N-methylethanamine. Applying a consideration of the stereochemistry of ring closure to N-methylpiperazine arising from alkylation of ammonia demonstrated that the observed 13c label distribution could only arise if aziridinium ion formation was irreversible. The isotope effect on ring opening of the aziridinium ion was measured under a range of reaction conditions for several different nucleophiles.Observation of the reaction between nitrogen mustard and methionine was simplified by the use of (S)-[13cH3]-methionine to demonstrate rapid formation of sulphonium salts and a slow breakdown to homocysteine and 2-methylthio-N-[2-(methylthio)ethyl]-N-methylethanamine.The synthesis of [2,2'-¹3C]-2-chloro-(N-2-chloro- ethyl)-N-methylanamine is described and a general synthesis of isotopically enriched nitrogen mustards is suggested based on this route. Efficient syntheses of (S)-[¹3CH₃]- methionine, (S)-[C²H₃]- methionine, (S) -ɑ - ²H-alanine and (S0 – (1-¹3C] - leucine are also described.","AI","Warwick University"

"Inquiry in question.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2692/","Joughin, Martin","April 1984","What follows is the transcript of an inquiry which takes itself as its object: an inquiry into its own inquiry. It opens out of a mere marking of its questioning, `?', and proceeds by questioning that mark, and the progress of its inquiry as transcription of something `open' into marks and questions - such transcription itself marked as only one thing open to the `writer'. Each successive attempt to transcribe into words the opening transition into `words', `text', `book', from some textually marked `context' in which the transition is open, simply leads into a questioning of each such attempted transcription, the bringing of its terms `into question'. The first section of the inquiry closes having marked out an internal `logical' space and time of these opening questions, coordinated around the initial question of marking a question: so many `dimensions' of lines of questioning `question' - in particular the external `physical' dimension of a `space' and `time' in which marking or transcription is (physically) open, and a `poetic' or figural dimension in which that `external' physical open-ness or space provides, like the `internal' logical space of logical, physical and poetic questions, and `image' for those three coordinate dimensions in whose textual and contextual interplay their transcription into a logical space and time of questions is open.","AI","Warwick University"

","April 1983","A theory of superfluidity (S.F.) is developed from first principles using two novel concepts, (1) that of a 'superfluid Ensemble' (S.E.) i.e. a 'Restricted Ensemble' constructed from a 'Separable Phase Space' (S.P.S.) admitting independent configurations, at least one set of which are statistically equivalent. (2) The notion of 'Dynamical Equivalence' (D.E.), satisfied if and only if (i) all dynamical symmetries are rearranged (not broken) for two Lagrangian formulations of the same problem and if (ii) the expectation values of all the constants of motion are the same, even if their functional expressions are not.

"Studies of alkylcobaloximes as models for a B12-dependent rearrangement.","https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/107459/","Kibende, Samson Mwesigye ","April 2024","The necessity for vitamin B12 in animals and the consequences of lack of it are well-documented in the literature. Its unique and indispensable role, and its active form as the coenzyme for at least eleven different enzymic rearrangements in vivo, are also known. The enzymic conversion of a-MG to MelT, which is the centre of interest in the present work, is one of these rearrangements.   However, the mechanism by which most of these rearrangements proceed is still a matter of speculation, based on logic and inconclusive experimental observations. Organocobalt model systems, which resulted from the suggestion that substrate-Co species are intermediates in these rearrangements, have been synthesised and studied in their thousands by various workers, and have in some instances shed light on this intriguing mechanistic problem.   This thesis is a description of the synthesis, characterisation and rearrangement of monocarboxylate-substituted but-3-enyl- and cyclopropylmethyl(pyridine)- cobaloximes, in a model study of the B^2-dePendent enzymic rearrangement of a-MG. The syntheses of the alkylating agents are described, and novel compounds, which are fully characterised, are reported.   The findings from this study suggest that alkyl-cobalamins postulated as intermediates in the reaction catalysed by a-MG mutase would be insufficiently reactive towards rearrangement. However, rapidly interconverting carboxy-substituted but-3-enyl and cyclopropylmethyl radicals are suggested to be plausible intermediates. An addenda to this thesis contains synthetic proposals for the continuation of this work.  A separate chapter (Chapter 5) describes the preparation and testing of the cyclic analogues of the antitumour drug busulphan, viz., oia— and trans-di(hydroxymethyUcyclopropane dimethanesulphonate. Both compounds showed little antitumour activity near their toxic dose. The implications of these observations for the mode of action of busulphan are discussed.","AI","Warwick University"

It is argued that the identification and labelling ofa criminal class was part of the effort to deny the relevance of class conflictby insisting on the relevance of moral distinctions.The first chapter seeks to plot the social ecology of crime through acomparison of a number of contrasting 'social areas' ranging from a highcrime to a no-crime area. Differences in the social characteristics of thepopulation living in these areas form the basis for explanations aboutdifferences in levels of reported crime, and of police attention.The second chapter deals with the law enforcement agencies of magistrates,Watch Committee and police - describing their personnel and their differentpriorities and strategies.In Part II we turn for the first time to the offenders. Chapter 3concentrates on juvenile offenders, their of fences and social characteristics,and on the policy and provision made for them, as well as on sentencingpractice, as carried out in Birmingham in the period.• Chapter 4 looks at the legislation for, and the definition of, theHabitual Criminal.

Three years later their status was checked to determine if they had been promoted or not. Differences examined in Successful managers between job types, Unsuccessful managers between job types, and between Successful and Unsuccessful managers within job type, for all managers as a whole regardless of job differences. The basic hypothesis of the research, that a situational approach to the prediction of managerial success differentiating managers by job type, would yield results than predictions of managerial success regard for job differences was supported. Significant differences in cognitive abilities, personality, self-perceived leadership style were found between Successful managers in the two job functions, and classification of Successfuls and Unsuccessfuls by discriminant analysis was more accurate for managers within specific job types than for the total sample of managersregard for job differences.","AI","Warwick University"

This problem was tackled in variousways by Schwarz, Fuchs himself, Gordan, Jordan, and Klein, with results thatdisplayed the new methods of group theory to advantage. At the same time,or a little earlier, the theory of modular transformations proclaimed byGalois was explored by several mathematicians, notably Hermite, and Kleinwas able to unite that work with his geometrical methods and the crucialobservations of Dedekind. This work marks the origin of the Galois theoryof function fields and the systematic study of modular functions.

(E,E)~ and (E,Z)-hepta-2,5- diene reacted with both complexes to give bidentate complexes whereas the (Z,Z)-isomer gave only an unstable bis(monodentate) complex. Interestingly, with E2Rh(I)hfpd, (E,E)-hepta-2,5-dien-4-ol gave a bidentate complex whereas the corresponding (E,Z)~ and (Z,Z)~ isomers gave only crystalline complexes which were characterised (by 'h n.m.r., i.r., m.s., and combustion analysis) as bis(monodentate) complexes. It is believed that these complexes are stabilised by an intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction, and this is supported by i.r. spectral studies and the observations that other allylic alcohols (e.g. prop-2-en-l-ol and but-3-en-2-ol) also form crystalline complexes when reacted with E2Rh(I)hfpd. With the dienol acetates only (E,E)~ 4-acetoxyhepta-2,5-diene formed a stable complex and it was later deduced that all of the isomeric dienol acetates were catalytically transformed from 3-acetoxy-l,4-dienes to l-acetoxy-2,4-dienes.
