"AI-T: software testing ontology for AI-based systems","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/ai-t-software-testing-ontology-for-ai-based-systems","Olszewska, J. I.","2020","Software testing is an expanding area which presents an increasing complexity. Indeed, on one hand, there is the development of technologies such as Software Testing as a Service (TaaS), and on the other hand, there is a growing number of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based softwares. Hence, this work is about the development of an ontological framework for AI-softwares’ Testing (AI-T), which domain covers both software testing and explainable artificial intelligence; the goal being to produce an ontology which guides the testing of AI softwares, in an effective and interoperable way. For this purpose, AI-T ontology includes temporal interval logic modelling of the software testing process as well as ethical principle formalization and has been built using the Enterprise Ontology (EO) methodology. Our resulting AI-T ontology proposes both conceptual andimplementation models and contains 708 terms and 706 axioms.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"AI Anxiety","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/ai-anxiety","Johnson, D.; Verdicchio, M.","1 Sept 2017","Recently a number of well-known public figures have expressed concern about the future development of artificial intelligence (AI), by noting that AI could get out of control and affect human beings and society in disastrous ways. Many of these cautionary notes are alarmist and unrealistic, and while there has been some pushback on these concerns, the deep flaws in the thinking that leads to them have not been called out. Much of the fear and trepidation is based on misunderstanding and confusion about what AI is and can ever be. In this work we identify 3 factors that contribute to this “AI anxiety”: an exclusive focus on AI programs that leaves humans out of the picture, confusion about autonomy in computational entities and in humans, and an inaccurate conception of technological development. With this analysis we argue that there are good reasons for anxiety about AI but not for the reasons typically given by AI alarmists.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Reframing AI Discourse","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/reframing-ai-discourse","Johnson, D.; Verdicchio, M.","Dec 2017","A critically important ethical issue facing the AI research community is how AI research and AI products can be responsibly conceptualised and presented to the public. A good deal of fear and concern about uncontrollable AI is now being displayed in public discourse. Public understanding of AI is being shaped in a way that may ultimately impede AI research. The public discourse as well as discourse among AI researchers leads to at least two problems: a confusion about the notion of ‘autonomy’ that induces people to attribute to machines something comparable to human autonomy, and a ‘sociotechnical blindness’ that hides the essential role played by humans at every stage of the design and deployment of an AI system. Here our purpose is to develop and use a language with the aim to reframe the discourse in AI and shed light on the real issues in the discipline.","AI","University of West Scotland"

Fostered by technological advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, such systems potentially have a wide range of applications in robotics, human computing, sensing and networking. The chapters focus on models and theoretical approaches to guarantee automation in large multi-scale implementations of AI and ML systems; protocol designs to ensure AI systems meet key requirements for future services such as latency; and optimisation algorithms to leverage the trusted distributed and efficient complex architectures.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"AI, agency and responsibility: the VW fraud case and beyond","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/ai-agency-and-responsibility-the-vw-fraud-case-and-beyond","Johnson, D.; Verdicchio, M.","30 Sept 2019","The concept of agency as applied to technological artifacts has become an object of heated debate in the context of AI research because some AI researchers ascribe to programs the type of agency traditionally associated with humans. Confusion about agency is at the root of misconceptions about the possibilities for future AI. We introduce the concept of a triadic agency that includes the causal agency of artifacts and the intentional agency of humans to better describe what happens in AI as it functions in real-world contexts. We use the VW emission fraud case to explain triadic agency since in this case a techno-logical artifact, namely software, was an essential part of the wrongdoing and the software might be said to have agency in the wrongdoing. We then extend the case to include futuristic AI, imagining AI that becomes more and more autonomous.","AI","University of West Scotland"

"Structured use of an AI chatbot to support student development of English for Academic Purposes","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/structured-use-of-an-ai-chatbot-to-support-student-development-of","Mullen, M.","13 Jul 2023","In recent years, and particularly since the launch of ChatGPT in December 2022, the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Google Bard on students’ academic output has both energised and terrified academic staff worldwide. Questions continue to rage over whether such assistive technology should be banned or embraced, and in the UK at least, the former appears to be the more common reaction, with a third of the elite Russel Group universities prohibiting use of LLMs, with many more considering doing so (Wood, 2023).Despite staff concerns over the threat of LLMs to academic integrity, it seems clear that students are keen to employ the technology, with 53% of students surveyed in the USA admitting to using ChatGPT to help with homework assignments (Westfall, 2023). In the view of this researcher, without a reliable method of detecting AI-supported output, its widespread use is inevitable, and universities should take a proactive approach in harnessing the affordances of LLMs.This presentation will report on a study implemented at a UK university in the Spring semester of 2023, in a module which helps students for whom English is not a first language develop their proficiency in English for Academic Purposes. Over the 12 weeks of the module, as he does every semester, the researcher worked with the students to develop research topics, introduced elements of academic English writing such as citating and referencing, topic sentences, paragraph structure, hedging, and signposting language. This trimester, however, student production of their essay was supported through the use of ChatGPT. As will be described in the presentation, students were instructed in the use of prompts, and upon receiving the output from ChatGPT, whole class discussions and evaluations were held to discuss the merits of the pieces of text, and how they could be further refined by the students themselves, given their own knowledge of the research topics. Overall, a majority of students reported that use of ChatGPT had improved the quality of the essay they had produced and also felt that the experience left them better equipped to produce future academic output without the use of LLMs. Nevertheless, they also sympathised with academic staff concerns of the threat to academic integrity posed by LLMs.The presentation will outline the process implemented during the semester, detail feedback from the students on their experience of using ChatGPT and their perceptions on its impact on their academic writing skills. The presentation will conclude by posing and answering some questions regarding the ethical position of implementing this structured use of chatGPT as an academic writing resource.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based identification of appliances in households through NILM","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/artificial-intelligence-ai-based-identification-of-appliances-in-","Mahmud, ASM. A.","11 Jul 2022","The Smart Grid (SG) technologies greatly enhance the electrical grid by providing more energy security, increasing efficiency, reliability and economically benefitting the supplier which translates to reduce prices to the end customer. This is significant, as most of the current available energy comes from non-renewable sources. Economic development of nations result in increased demand for energy resources and as the world moves forward, the rate at which these resources are being spent is increasing. The SG poses numerous challenges in the fields of communication, engineering and policymaking. An aspect of the SG Technologies like Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) enables the collection of valuable information that can be used to increase energy efficiency and gain deep insight on energy statistics. Novel software approaches like Deep Neural Networks, Markov models and Support Vector Machines play an important role for solving the NILM problem. In addition, researchers are delving into other aspects of the implementation such as privacy, price, and resource usage that coming from the paradigms of cloud and edge computing. Expert analysis on all of these topics is essential for the adoption of SG technology. In this paper, the merits of the various AI/ML techniques are expanded upon in a literature review. Then the previous and current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Deep Learning are evaluated and a conclusion is reached on their performance and viability. Furthermore, a case is made about relevant computing paradigms and how they may impact fundamental areas of the technology.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"A hybrid explainable AI framework applied to global and local facial expression recognition","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/a-hybrid-explainable-ai-framework-applied-to-global-and-local-fac","Deramgozin, M.; Jovanovic, S.; Rabah, H.; Ramzan, N.","27 Dec 2021","Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems have many applications such as human behavior understanding, human machine interface, video games and health monitoring. The main advantage of the traditional white box methods is their explainability. However, the accuracy of recognition of these methods is completely reliant on the extracted features. On the other hand, the use of deep neural networks has advantage regarding the overall precision compared to traditional methods. Indeed, they are considered as black box methods and thus suffer from lack of reliability and explainability. In this work, we introduce a hybrid AI explainable framework (HEF) composed of a main functional pipeline comprising a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify input images and an explainable pipeline using Facial Action Units and application agnostic models LIME providing more useful data allowing to explain the obtained results and reinforce the decision provided by the main functional pipeline. The proposed HEF has been validated on the CK+ dataset and shows very promising results in terms of explainability of the obtained results.","AI","University of West Scotland"

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of digital infrastructure, systems, soft-ware, and platforms for the survival of businesses and independent workers un-der the threat of this unprecedented health crisis. The cultural sectors were one of the hardest-hit due to their reliance on face-to-face interactions and limited embeddedness of digital tools and remote modes of working (Webb 2021). In response to a need for ensuring greater sustainability and resilience within cul-tural production and work systems, digitalisation is currently being discussed as the key strategy for the cultural sectors’ recovery. However, as the sectors con-tinue to reflect on the devastating long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems that digital and technological innovations far exceed the limited options utilised by arts and cultural organisations before and during the pandemic.

Some devoted their efforts to a systematic foundation of philosophy of AI, taking for granted its placement within philosophy of science. Such endeavors were based on the view of AI as a scientific discipline, primarily aimed at answering questions about the nature of intelligence. Thus, it was natural to consider philosophy of AI, like philosophy of physics and of biology, as part of philosophy of science. We believe, however, that this position must be reconsidered today in the light of the issues recently tackled by AI and of the emergence of new fields of analysis: philosophy of technology and philosophy and engineering. In this paper we analyze how the view of AI as engineering influences philosophy of AI. Moreover, we argue that philosophy of AI, under this influence, can contribute to the foundation of the emerging philosophy of engineering.","AI","University of West Scotland"

"Camera activism in contemporary People's Republic of China: provocative documentation, first person confrontation, and collective force in Ai Weiwei's Lao ","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/camera-activism-in-contemporary-peoples-republic-of-china-provoca","Yu, T.","2015",") is one of the most influential activist documentaries that emerged during the aftermath of Sichuan earthquake in 2009. The film relates to Ai's ‘Public Citizen Investigation Project’, which gathers many volunteers to explore the substandard ‘tofu construction’ of school buildings that took thousands of children's lives when they collapsed in the earthquake. In August 2009, Ai's group went to Chengdu court to support another independent investigator, writer, and environmentalist Tan Zuoren who was prosecuted for subversion of state power. The night before the trial, Ai was beaten by secret security agents and the group was stopped from going to the court. The film subsequently records the group searching for an official explanation from the authorities. Whilst acknowledging the power of the film in constructing a collective political subjectivity, and the discursive effect through screenings and discussions raised, this paper focuses on the very action of proactive, activist documentation of one's witness to engage with fellow participants as well as viewer followers through digital camera. Under the theoretical framework of participatory culture, I propose the term camera activism to understand the camera-enabled individual participation into activism as a form of socio-political intervention. The paper also analyses some of Ai's problematic actions as a charismatic celebrity, which sometimes overshadow and obscure the complexity of resistance by Chinese individuals within China, thereby neglecting full recognition of the complex collective forces which support Ai. Nevertheless, ‘camera activism’ demonstrated in the making of Lao Ma Ti Hua reflects, and has the potential to reshape, the political landscape in twenty-first century China. The cinematic highlight of ‘I’, confronting and eye-witnessing what happens through the utilization of digital technologies positions ‘camera activism’ as an important part of China's iGeneration cinema culture.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Enabling generative AI to produce SQL statements: a framework for the auto-generation of knowledge based on EBNF context-free grammars","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/enabling-generative-ai-to-produce-sql-statements-a-framework-for-","Troy, C.; Sturley, S.; Alcaraz-Calero, J. M.; Wang, Q.","1 Nov 2023","The motivation of this paper is to be able to generate high-quality (Structured Query Language) SQL language sentences in terms of syntax and semantics so that they are intended to achieve a concrete predefined and well-known aim. For example, generating SQL sentences that are capable of detecting a cyber-attack from a set of metrics available in a database table. Two solutions are needed to achieve so, a tool that enables and performs the syntactically valid generation of SQL sentences and an (Artificial intelligence) AI algorithm able to guide the semantics of such generations to the achievement of the best sentences for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this manuscript is the first of these solutions. To be concrete, this paper proposes a tool to enable and generate syntactic-valid language sentences. The tool can deal with any language defined as an ANTLR4 EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar. The paper also provides a methodology to help achieve an EBNF grammar suitable for addressing concerns related to ambiguity and recursion as a direct result of the generation process. The paper further implements a prototype utilizing ANTLR4’s recognizer and its Augmented Transition Network for language generation using EBNF grammars. In-depth design and logic implementation are provided, showcasing areas of interest for AI integration. The achieved prototype showed an ability to easily generate syntactically valid SQL statements at various depths, with observable problems becoming more apparent during the exponential recursive growth. Our mitigation controls for such scenarios proved to be successful and were able to complete the recursion whilst also moving the push-down automata forward until query completion. Experimental validation was performed against a SQL EBNF grammar feeding the generated SQL statement into an SQL parser to validate the syntax.","AI","University of West Scotland"

"Policy making and artificial intelligence in Scotland","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/policy-making-and-artificial-intelligence-in-scotland","Pautz, H.","18 Dec 2023","The article presents an exploratory qualitative single case study about whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) is used by the Scottish Government, about the key concerns relating to its usage, and about obstacles to, and drivers of AI usage. Besides the academic literature and published reports, the analysis rests on 12 semi-structured interviews. Interviewees include Scottish Government employees, experts from academia and representatives of commercial and non-commercial AI and Big Data organisations. The article finds that the Scottish Government has, so far, made little use of AI. Currently, AI is used in very limited ways in process automation and for gaining ‘cognitive insights’ with the human in control. There are no ‘strategic’ AI applications where advanced reasoning and ‘decision-making by algorithm’ play a role. Data-driven e-policy making is not currently on the cards. The reasons are the Scottish Government’s wariness of AI, a lack of ‘digital maturity’ (concerning Big Data and digital infrastructure, but also expertise) in the public sector, and ethical concerns around the use of AI. Governments need to conduct a debate about the extent of AI usage to avoid ‘AI creep’ in their institutions and to assure that AI does not have negative consequences for democracy.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"On the use of pride, hope and fear in China’s international artificial intelligence narratives on CGTN","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/on-the-use-of-pride-hope-and-fear-in-chinas-international-artific","van Noort, C.","16 Feb 2022","China communicates strategic narratives about artificial intelligence (AI) in digital media productions to create a shared meaning about its actions and its image in the global race to develop AI. Building upon the literature in emotions and strategic narratives, this study seeks to clarify which emotions are discursively used in China’s international AI narratives, and their function and significance. Specifically, the study investigates emotion discourses in AI-focused videos disseminated on China’s international broadcasting (CGTN YouTube channel). The analysis reveals that pride, hope and fear discourses have multiple functions in China’s international AI narratives on CGTN. Hope is used to represent China as a key competitor in the global AI race, who is catching up to the US. China uses pride to showcase its advances in AI applications, to highlight its transformation of traditional industries, and to identity itself as equal to the US. Fear is used to frame US’s perception of China’s AI developments, to suggest their crisis of confidence, but also to refute the “China threat”. Additionally, the fear discourse is used to deliberate anticipated risks, particularly on job loss and data privacy. These emotion discourses forge China’s identity as a future global AI power. The paper then discusses how these findings contribute to key debates about Chinese discourse and media strategy.","AI","University of West Scotland"

M.; Wang, Q.","29 Feb 2024","The next generation of network capabilities coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) can provide innovative solutions for network control and self-optimisation. Network control demands a detailed knowledge of the network components to enforce the correct control rules. To this end, an immense number of metrics related to devices, flows, network rules, etc. can be used to describe the state of the network and to gain insights about which rule to enforce depending on the context. However, selection of the most relevant metrics often proves challenging and there is no readily available tool that can facilitate the dataset extraction and labelling for AI model training. This research work therefore first develops an analysis of the most relevant metrics in terms of network control to create a training dataset for future AI development purposes. It then presents a new architecture to allow the extraction of these metrics from a 5G network with a novel dataset visualisation and labelling tool to help perform the exploratory analysis and the labelling process of the resultant dataset. It is expected that the proposed architecture and its associated tools would significantly speed up the training process, which is crucial for the data-driven approach in developing AI-based network control capabilities.","AI","University of West Scotland"

Focus groups and semi-structured interviews tapped information seeking behaviour and the use of AI to support inclusion and healthcare decision making and were thematically analysed, informed by a framework approach.Results: Questionnaire data demonstrated variable use and understanding of AI, as well as correlations between knowledge of AI and views regarding its relevance.Qualitative data highlighted the crucial role of communication partners when using AI and the deficits in current NHS information provision.Conclusions: AI is traditionally regarded as a niche resource, particularly relevant within learning disability services. Our results highlight its potential to support empowering partnerships with service users and thereby help address persistent health inequalities. AI should therefore be considered as the default form of information provision.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Symbolic Reasoning for Hearthstone","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/symbolic-reasoning-for-hearthstone","Stiegler, A.; Dahal, K.; Maucher, J.; Livingstone, D.","19 May 2017","Trading-Card-Games are an interesting problem domain for Game AI, as they feature some challenges, such as highly variable game mechanics, that are not encountered in this intensity in many other genres. We present an expert system forming a player-level AI for the digital Trading-Card-Game Hearthstone. The bot uses a symbolic approach with a semantic structure, acting as an ontology, to represent both static descriptions of the game mechanics and dynamic game-state memories. Methods are introduced to reduce the amount of expert knowledge, such as popular moves or strategies, represented in the ontology, as the bot should derive such decisions in a symbolic way from its knowledge base. We narrow down the problem domain, selecting the relevant aspects for a play-to-win bot approach and comparing an ontology-driven approach to other approaches such as machine learning and case-based reasoning. Upon this basis, we describe how the semantic structure is linked with the game-state and how different aspects, such as memories, are encoded. An example will illustrate how the bot, at runtime, uses rules and queries on the semantic structure combined with a simple utility system to do reasoning and strategic planning. Finally, an evaluation is presented that was conducted by fielding the bot against the stock “Expert” AI that Hearthstone is shipped with, as well as Human opponents of various skill levels in order to assess how well the bot plays. Evaluating how believable the bot reasons is assessed through a Pseudo-Turing test.","AI","University of West Scotland"

However, vehicles with automated driving capabilities are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors that complement the perception capacity of camera-based AI algorithms. For this reason, this paper tries to reveal the degree of readiness of one of the most used open-source AI models for Level 2 automated driving. To this end, a set of simulated common driving scenarios were used to evaluate the predictions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the current capacity of this camera-based DNN model is not sufficient to be the only source of information in the process of environment perception of a Level 2 automated vehicle, and therefore, further progress in the context awareness needs to be achieved to consider its sole use in the perception stage.","AI","University of West Scotland"

The focus of this article is on the relationship between the UK and EU surrounding the AI case study from 2005 to early 2007. The analysis is informed by interviews conducted with officials based in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) who have been involved in projecting or `uploading' national policy preferences to the European Commission and, at the same time, accommodating or `downloading' the rules and regulations that have emanated mainly from the Standing Committee for Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) of the Commission. The article, therefore, adopts a dynamic view of Europeanization processes in order to analyse transnational policy making for AI outbreaks. The article shows that dynamic Europeanization processes are effective in conceptualizing and explaining transnational policy making for AI across the UK and EU levels.

A.; Shakir, M. Z.; Olszewska, J. I.","1 Jan 2023","Whether by habit or necessity, people tend to spend most of their time indoors. Built-up Carbon dioxide (CO2) can lead to a series of negative health effects such as nausea, headache, fatigue, and so on. Thus, indoor air quality must be monitored for a variety of health reasons. Various air quality monitoring systems are available on the market. However, since they are expensive and difficult to obtain, they are not commonly employed by the general population. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring system has been simplified, and a number of studies have been conducted in order to monitor the IAQ using IoT. In this paper, we propose an improved IoT-based, low-cost IAQ monitoring system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide recommendations. In our proposed system, the IoT sensors transmit data via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol which can be visualised in real time on a user-friendly dashboard. Furthermore, the AI technique referred to as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is applied to the collected CO2 data for the purpose of predicting future CO2 concentrations. Based on the predicted CO2 concentration, our system can compute CO2 steady state in advance with an error margin of 5.5%.","AI","University of West Scotland"

Readers are first provided with a general description of the field, followed by the main models of human affect, with special emphasis to Russell's Circumplex model and the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) model. Finally, an AI-based method for the detection of affect elicited via multimedia stimuli is presented. The method combines both connectivity-based and channel-based EEG features with a selection method that considerably reduces the dimensionality of the data and allows for efficient classification. In particular, the Relative Energy (RE) and its logarithm in the spatial domain, as well as the spectral power (SP) in the frequency domain are computed for the four typically used EEG frequency bands (α, β, γ and θ), and complemented with the mutual information measured over all EEG channel pairs. The resulting features are then reduced by using a hybrid method that combines supervised and unsupervised feature selection. Detection results are compared to state-of-the-art methods on the DEAP benchmarking dataset for emotion analysis, which is composed of labelled EEG recordings from 32 individuals, acquired while watching 40 music videos. The acquired results demonstrate the potential of AI-based methods for emotion recognition, an application that can significantly benefit the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI) and of quality-of-experience (QoE).","AI","University of West Scotland"

Lipoprotein(a) was also measured as an independentrisk factor for cardiovascular disease.The participants (n = 32) were matched for age andwere divided into four distinct age-matched groups:long-term ( 420 years) AAS users (n = 8) who were stillusing at the time of testing (Group A); long-term (420years) AAS users who had been abstinent for a period ofmore than 3 months (Group B); bodybuilding controlswho did not use any pharmacological ergogenic aids(Group C); and sedentary male controls (Group D).The AAS-using control group had abstained from AASuse for a minimum of 12 weeks before examination.Venous plasma blood samples were collected 12 h postprandial using the standard venepuncture method.Cholesterol subfractions, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein(a) were measured using appropriate assays. Group differences were analysed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Tukey test; a level of P 50.05 was selected to indicate statistical significance.The mean body mass index (BMI) was significantlyhigher in both groups of AAS users compared with thecontrols (P5 0.01). The sedentary control group hadsignificantly higher body fat (P5 0.05). There were nodifferences between groups for total cholesterol ortriglycerides. However, HDL-C and the HDLC:TOT-Cratio were significantly lower (P 50.01), while LDL-C and the LDL:TOT-C ratio were significantly higher (P 50.01), in Group A. Both Apo AI and Apo AII were significantly lower (P5 0.01) in Group A than Groups C and D, but not Group B. Apo B was significantly higher (P5 0.05) in Group A than the other three groups. Although there were trends between Group B and Groups C and D, for Apo AI and Apo AII, they did not reach significance. Lipoprotein(a) was significantly higher (P5 0.05) in Groups A and B than Groups C and D.The higher lipoprotein(a) concentrations, as foundin both groups of AAS users, does not conform with thefew previous reports and provides evidence for elevatedlevels of lipoprotein(a) following long-term AAS use.Although the synthesis and regulation of lipoprotein(a)and LDL-C cholesterol concentrations in the bloodexist independently of each other, the elevation of bothfactors confers an additive risk of cardiovascular diseaseup to five-fold when both are abnormally high.Considering the magnitude of the AAS-induced LDLCelevation in this study, the potential for artherogenicand thrombotic events among bodybuilders usinganabolic androgenic steroids is increased.","AI","University of West Scotland"

J.","Sept 2003","Lipoprotein particles (Lps) in normal human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are distinct from those found in plasma and include unique apolipoprotein E (apoE indicates protein; APOE, gene) containing lipoproteins rarely seen in human plasma. Less favourable neurological recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been observed in patients who possess the APOE epsilon4 allele raising the possibility that apoE influences neuronal survival after brain injury. We analysed Lps from control and SAH CSF testing the hypotheses that following brain injury CSF Lps undergo remodelling and apoE containing Lps are selectively depleted from brain injury CSF. Lipoproteins were fractionated using CSF from six control pools and six patients with SAH on a sepharose 6HR 10/30 size exclusion column. Fractions were assayed for total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), phospholipid, triglyceride (TG), apoE, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI). Compared to control CSF there were significant (P<0.05) increases in TC, FC, TG, and apoAI in SAH CSF. Plasma sized apoB-containing lipoproteins and a very small apoAI-containing Lps were identified in the SAH CSF, which were not present in controls. However, despite the release of plasma lipoproteins into the subarachnoid space, there was no significant increase in CSF apoE. These data provide novel indirect evidence suggesting that after SAH CSF Lps undergo remodelling and apoE containing Lps are selectively reduced in brain injury CSF. The remodelling of CSF Lps and selective reduction of apoE containing lipoproteins may reflect an important response of the human brain to injury.","AI","University of West Scotland"

Variations in genes involved in lipid metabolism may act synergistically to confer risk or protection against CAD. The objective of the present study was to determine such interactions in variants of apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein A1 genes. One hundred and forty subjects with clinically confirmed CAD and 100 unrelated normal subjects participated in the study. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate lipid and apolipoprotein profiles with genotypes. Odd ratios were calculated for various combinations of ApoE and ApoA1 genotypes. Prevalence of ApoE 'E4' and ApoA1 'A' and 'T' alleles was significantly higher in patients than controls. Serum apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein A1 levels were significantly lower in CAD patients than controls. When lipid parameters were related to genotypes, the polymorphisms associated to various markers were in agreement with previous reports. ApoE 2/4 genotype in combination with either ApoA1 heterozygous GA or CT genotype conferred higher risk of CAD. E3 allele in homozygous or heterozygous state in combination with ApoA1+83 CC genotype conferred highest protection (P < 0.05). Thus, it appears that ApoE and ApoA1 gene variants may act synergistically to associate with risk and protection against CAD.","AI","University of West Scotland"

These have important implications for regional and local labour markets, skills development and observatories.This chapter starts with a brief description of digitalisation in Higher Education to offer context for the digital transformation of university learning. Section 3 considers who might be particularly affected by barriers around the move to large-scale E-Learning in terms of digital access and the digital divide. This is fol-lowed by exploration of three key issues around the unintended consequences related to the rapid uptake of digitised teaching and learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues are: (1) the impact of E-learning on assessment, par-ticularly where and how learning is delivered due to remote learning and as-sessment; (2) the use of learning analytics,  and how data is gathered and used particularly with the growing use of learning analytics which can undermine pri-vacy and increase the surveillance of people’s activities?; (3)  the implications of machine learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) in learning and teaching, and what ways students are supported by digitalisation through the increased use of Ma-chine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants for students?

Serum concentrations of cholesterol, HDL, LDL and non-esterified fatty acids decreased following both N and H training (P<0.05-P<0.001 v PRE, NS between groups). Apolipoproteins A1 and B decreased following N training only (P<0.001). Whilst serum concentrations of vitamin B12 and red cell folate remained stable, plasma total homocysteine increased by 10% (P<0.05) and decreased by 11% following N and H training respectively. V̇O2max increased by 0.47±0.77 L.min−1 (P<0.05) and the rate pressure product decreased by 3±6% (P<0.05) due to a 10±9 mmHg decrease in maximum systolic blood pressure (P<0.001) following H training only. In summary, these data highlight the synergistic effects of physical exercise and intermittent hypoxia which resulted in marked changes in an individual's health and fitness profile.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"D7-R4: software development life-cycle for intelligent vision systems","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/d7-r4-software-development-life-cycle-for-intelligent-vision-syst","Olszewska, J. I.","30 Sept 2019","Intelligent Vision Systems (IVS) are omnipresent in our daily life from social media apps to m-health services, from street surveillance cameras to airport e-gates, from drones to companion robots. Hence, IVS encompass any software which has a visual input processed by means of algorithm(s) involving Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. The design and development of these IVS softwares has become an increasingly complex task, since vision-based systems have evolved into (semi-)autonomous AI systems, usually requiring effective and ethical data processing along with efficient signal processing and real-time hardware/software integration as well as User Experience (UX) and (cyber)security features. Consequently, IVS system development necessitates an adapted software development life-cycle (SDLC) addressing these multi-domain needs, whilst being developer friendly. Hence, we propose in this paper a new SDLC we called D7-R4 which allows developers to produce quality, new-generation IVS to be deployed in real-time and in real-world, unstructured environments.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"The effect of two different 18-week walking programmes on aerobic fitness, selected blood lipids and factor XIIa","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effect-of-two-different-18-week-walking-programmes-on-aerobic","Woolf-May, K.; Kearney, E. M.; Jones, D. W.; Davison, R. C. R.; Coleman, D.; Bird, S. R.","Nov 1998","Forty-nine previously sedentary or low active individuals aged 40–71 years were allocated to three groups. The long walking group participated in an 18-week walking programme which consisted of walks lasting 20–40 min; the repetitive short walking group completed walks of between 10 and 15 min, up to three times a day, with no less than 120 min between each walk; and the control group maintained their low level of activity. Both walking programmes began at a prescribed 60 min . week -1 , which increased steadily up to 200 min . week -1 by week 12. During the study, the long walking group walked for an estimated 2514 min (139 min . week -1 ), expending an estimated 67.5 MJ (3.72 MJ . week -1 ) at an estimated 73% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate and 68% of their estimated V O 2m ax . The repetitive short walking group walked for an estimated 2476 min (135 min . week -1 ), expending an estimated 58.5 MJ (3.17 MJ . week -1 ) at an estimated 71% of their age-predicted maximum heart rate and 65% of their estimated V O 2m ax . The results showed a statistically significant reduction in heart rate during a standardized step test (pre- vs post-intervention) in both walking groups, indicating an improvement in aerobic fitness, although the control group showed a higher average heart rate during the post-intervention test, indicating reduced fitness. When compared with the male subjects pre-intervention, the females possessed more favourable levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P < 0.001), apolipoprotein (apo) AI (P < 0.001) and ratios of total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol (P < 0.02) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: HDL cholesterol (P < 0.02). Compared with the controls post-intervention, the walking groups showed no statistically significant changes in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apo AI, apo AII, apo B, or the ratios of total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol: HDL cholesterol, apo AI : apo B or apo AI : apo AII (P > 0.05). Relative to the walking groups, factor XIIa increased in the control group (P < 0.05). We conclude that, although both walking programmes appeared to improve aerobic fitness, there was no evidence of improvements in the blood lipids or associated apolipoproteins of the walking groups. Further analysis indicated that this apparent lack of change may have been related to the subjects' relatively good pre-intervention blood lipid profiles, which restricted the potential for change. The implications of the observed changes in the coagulation/fibrinolytic factors remain unclear.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Training in hypoxia: modulation of metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in men","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/training-in-hypoxia-modulation-of-metabolic-and-cardiovascular-ri","Bailey, D. M.; Davies, B.; Baker, J.","1 Jun 2000","Purpose This study was designed to determine changes in metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors following normobaric hypoxic exercise training in healthy men.Methods Following a randomized baseline maximal exercise test in hypoxia and/or normoxia, 34 physically active subjects were randomly assigned to either a normoxic (N = 14) or a hypoxic (N = 18) training group. Training involved 4 wk of cycling exercise inspiring either a normobaric normoxic (F IO2 = ∼20.9%) or a normobaric hypoxic (F IO2 = ∼16.0%) gas, respectively, in a double-blind manner. Cycling exercise was performed three times per week for 20–30 min at 70–85% of maximum heart rate determined either in normoxia or hypoxia. Resting plasma concentrations of blood lipids, lipoproteins, total homocysteine, and auscultatory arterial blood pressure responses at rest and in response to submaximal and maximal exercise were measured before and 4 d after physical training.Results Total power output during the training period was identical in both normoxic and hypoxic groups. Lean body mass increased by 1.4 ± 1.5 kg following hypoxic training only (P < 0.001). While dietary composition and nutrient intake did not change during the study, both normoxic and hypoxic training decreased resting plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (P < 0.05 - < 0.001). Apolipoproteins AI and B decreased following normoxic training only (P ≤ 0.001). Plasma concentrations of resting total homocysteine decreased by 11% following hypoxic training (P ≤ 0.05) and increased by 10% (P < 0.05) following normoxic training. These changes were independent of changes in serum vitamin B12 and red cell folate which remained stable throughout. A decreased lactate concentration during submaximal exercise was observed in response to both normoxic and hypoxic training. Hypoxic training decreased maximal systolic blood pressure by 10 ± 9 mm Hg (P < 0.001) and the rate pressure product by 14 ± 23 mm Hg × beats·min−1/100 (P ≤ 0.001) and increased maximal oxygen uptake by 0.47 ± 0.77 L·min−1 (P < 0.05).Conclusion Normoxic and hypoxic training was associated with significant improvements in selected risk factors and exercise capacity. The stimulus of intermittent normobaric hypoxia invoked an additive cardioprotective effect which may have important clinical implications.","AI","University of West Scotland"

"The efficacy of accumulated short bouts versus single daily bouts of brisk walking in improving aerobic fitness and blood lipid profiles","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/the-efficacy-of-accumulated-short-bouts-versus-single-daily-bouts","Woolf-May, K.; Kearney, E. M.; Owen, A.; Jones, D. W.; Davison, R. C. R.; Bird, S. R.","Dec 1999","Fifty-six subjects (19 men and 37 woman) aged between 40 and 66 completed the study. They were allocated into three walking groups and a control group (C). The three walking groups performed the same total amount of walking for 18 weeks, but completed it in bouts of differing durations and frequencies. These were Long Walkers (LW; 20-40 min/bout), Intermediate Walkers (IW; 10-15 min/bout) and Short Walkers (SW; 5-10 min/bout); with the IW and SW performing more than one bout of walking a day. Following the 18 week walking programme, compared to the C group all walking groups showed similar improvements in fitness as determined by a reduction in blood lactate during a graded treadmill walking test (LW 1.0 mmol/l; IW 0. 8 mmol/l; SW 1.2 mmol/l; C 0.2 mmol/l; P = 0.003) and reduction in final heart rate (LW 8 beats/min; IW 6 beats/min; SW 10 beats/min; C 0 beats/min; P = 0.056). Also compared to the C group, the LW and IW groups recorded statistically significant decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LW 0.29 mmol/l; IW 0.41 mmol/l; P = 0.024), whereas the control group showed a mean increase of 0.22 mmol/l. The LW and IW groups also showed significant reductions in apolipoprotein (apo) A-II (LW 0.05 g/l; IW 0.02 g/l; SW 0.01 g/l; C 0.00 g/l; P = 0.012) with the LW recording a statistically significant increase in the ratio of apo A-I/A-II (LW, 0.19, P = 0. 044). In conclusion, some health benefits were achieved from all walking programmes. However, whilst the changes in aerobic fitness were similar, the effects upon blood lipid profiles were not. The findings from this study suggest that the LW regimen was most effective in benefiting blood lipid profile, followed by the IW regimen, with the SW being least potent. Nevertheless, for the sedentary/low-active members of society, any improvement in health may be considered as important. Therefore accumulated bouts of moderate intensity exercise, which according to theories of exercise behaviour may be more easily incorporated into an individual's lifestyle than single prolonged bouts, may be advocated for health promotion but may not be as effective as the traditionally prescribed 20-40 min bouts.","AI","University of West Scotland"

Applications of these technologies are even more essential for maternal and infant health, since maternal and infant health is vital for a healthy society. Over the last few years, researchers have delved into sensing and artificially intelligent healthcare systems for maternal and infant health. Sensors are exploited to gauge health parameters, and machine learning techniques are investigated to predict the health conditions of patients to assist medical practitioners. Since these healthcare systems deal with large amounts of data, significant development is also noted in the computing platforms. The relevant literature reports the potential impact of ICT-enabled systems for improving maternal and infant health. This article reviews wearable sensors and AI algorithms based on existing systems designed to predict the risk factors during and after pregnancy for both mothers and infants. This review covers sensors and AI algorithms used in these systems and analyzes each approach with its features, outcomes, and novel aspects in chronological order. It also includes discussion on datasets used and extends challenges as well as future work directions for researchers.","AI","University of West Scotland"

The main contribution is the successful introduction of the prior-art deep learning technique into high resolution rainfall rate prediction with significant improvement in accuracy. This is very important for the effective implementation of fade mitigation techniques for both terrestrial and satellite networks. The comparison of the models’ performances with ground truth (radar measurements) shows that the proposed models give an excellent mean square error (MSE) and Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) in rainfall fields reconstruction if the network depth falls in the range of 15~25 weight layers. The final model uses 20 layers for high resolution point rain rates prediction. Further study shows that the LD model offers a faster convergence and yields a more accurate rain rate prediction. In particular, this paper compares the rain rate exceedance distribution and Log-Normality property from the model estimates with values calculated from measured data. Results show that the LD model gives a highly accurate estimates of these two indices with corresponding Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 5.1709 × 10 -4 and 0.0013, respectively.","AI","University of West Scotland"

This paper proposes an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for analysing 3D PET volumes. ANFIS performance evaluation has been carried out using confusion matrix, accuracy, and misclassification value. Two PET phantom data sets, clinical PET volume of nonsmall cell lung cancer patient, and PET volumes from seven patients with laryngeal tumours have been used in this study to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

To this end, gender classification performance is evaluated using orthogonally transformed speech features. The performance is then compared to the case when speech features are used without transformation. Two machine learning approaches are used in the evaluation. One of them primarily depends on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and the other one uses Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results show that less correlated speech features, obtained after the orthogonal transformation, provides better classification performance.","AI","University of West Scotland"

An interesting aspect of this game domain is the strong influence of their metagame: in this particular case deck-construction. Before a game starts, players select which cards from a vast card pool they want to take into the current game session, defining their available options and a great deal of their strategy. We introduce an approach to do automatic deck construction for the digital Trading Card Game Hearthstone, based on a utility system utilizing several metrics to cover gameplay concepts such as cost effectiveness, the mana curve, synergies towards other cards, strategic parameters about a deck as well as data on how popular a card is within the community. The presented approach aims to provide useful information about a deck for a player-level AI playing the actual game session at runtime. Herein, the key use case is to store information on why cards were included and how they should be used in the context of the respective deck. Besides creating new decks from scratch, the algorithm is also capable of filling holes in existing deck skeletons, fitting an interesting use case for Human Hearthstone players: adapting a deck to their specific pool of available cards. After introducing the algorithms and describing the different utility sources used, we evaluate how the algorithm performs in a series of experiments filling holes in existing decks of the Hearthstone eSports scene.","AI","University of West Scotland"

"Porting SYCL accelerated neural network frameworks to edge devices","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/porting-sycl-accelerated-neural-network-frameworks-to-edge-device","Angus, D.; Georgiev, S.; Gonzalez, H. A.; Riordan, J.; Keir, P.; Goli, M.","18 Apr 2023","Portable hardware acceleration has become increasingly necessary with the rise of the popularity of edge computing. Edge computing, referring to the distributed computing paradigm that encourages data to be processed and stored as close to the source of origination as possible, is needed in areas where bandwidth and latency are restricted and network stability, privacy, or security are unreliable or insecure. Examples of such situations are autonomous mobile robotics, such as autonomous tractors, which often have numerous cameras connected to the host, all needing processing in areas where there can be no reliable connection to a cloud-based platform. Additionally, bridge surveying drones, where mapping and path-planning are needed with low latency, can benefit from a lightweight, compact, low-powered device, especially when there are size and energy consumption requirements.Thus, edge devices, which work as small but compact computers, leverage onboard accelerators to tackle various Robotics, Computer Vision and AI tasks directly on the device without needing an external connection. These accelerators often take the popular form of a GPU like Nvidia’s Jetson development kit series, which are driven by the same workflows of Nvidia’s AI software and cloud-native frameworks while staying lean, compact and less energy-demanding. However, with the increasing popularity of FPGAs, in the future we could see more edge devices like AMD and Xilinx’s KR260 robotics development kit, that operate at low power.Hence, with the surge of the usefulness of edge devices and variety in the brand and type of accelerators, the need for hardware portability in edge devices expands as well. Thus, as we will show in this talk, SYCL as an open-standard, high-level parallel programming model which provides portability not only at the API level but also at the compiler level provides this hardware portability by enabling the same software to be run on both CPU, GPU and FPGA-based edge devices. Additionally, we will show how we maintain performance through device-specific kernel specialisation.The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open-source artificial intelligence ecosystem of technology companies and research organizations that establish open standards for representing machine learning algorithms and software tools. ONNX is available on GitHub. This presentation will explain how we used DPC++, an open source SYCL implementation, to compile the SYCL backend of the ONNX runtime, to target NVIDIA’s Jetson series architecture. DPC++ allows us to compile for the ONNX runtime SYCL backend and use the Jetson’s onboard GPU and also use ComputeAorta, Codeplay’s multi-target, multi-platform framework, as an OpenCL implementation to target the Jetson’s onboard CPU. We will show the performance we get using the ONNX runtime CPU backend and the SYCL backend targeting Jetson’s GPU and CPU. The ONNX runtime SYCL backend is implemented using the lightweight templated SYCL-BLAS and SYCL-DNN libraries that include kernels with tuning parameters such as cache size, workgroup size and local memory size based on the device-specific hardware. Once tuned for the Jetson, the SYCL backend showed comparable performance with the native CUDA backend used by ONNX.Finally, using the ONNX runtime SYCL backend and an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX edge device, we will discuss ongoing work of aerial classification using image/radar data. Furthermore, we will discuss preliminary lab results to show how our stack affects latency and energy consumption and why it is so important in this use case.For future work, we hope to enable and tune SYCL-DNN/SYCL-BLAS for other Jetson devices as well as FPGA and RISC-V-based edge devices.","AI","University of West Scotland"

Using well-established Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies, linked to ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KG), it can help identify the concepts and entities throughout texts, and index sentences and summaries as per a citizen’s customized knowledge base. These annotations can then be leveraged to recommend relevant text excerpts end-users could build upon, within teams if they chose to do so, and possibly compose and customize legislative critiques and recommendations thoroughly tested for coherence, accuracy, and evidence. The present study proposes an international open-source initiative among parliaments to ensure the launch and viability of a suite of LegisIntel solutions. It reports on the completed initial phase of this initiative, aiming to prepare discussions in launching an international consultation among peers.

I.","19 May 2021","A wide range of techniques exist to help control the thermal comfort of an occupant in indoor environments. A novel technique is presented here to adaptively estimate the occupant’s metabolic rate. This is performed by utilising occupant’s actions using computer vision system to identify the activity of an occupant. Recognized actions are then translated into metabolic rates. The widely used Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) thermal comfort index is computed using the adaptivey estimated metabolic rate value. The PMV is then used as an input to a fuzzy control system. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using simulations of various activities. The integration of PMV thermal comfort index and action recognition system gives the opportunity to adaptively control occupant’s thermal comfort without the need to attach a sensor on an occupant all the time. The obtained results are compared with the results for the case of using one or two fixed metabolic rates. The included results appear to show improved performance, even in the presence of errors in the action recognition system.","AI","University of West Scotland"

These machines run at variable load and variable speed creating vibration bootstrap thus causing machine failure due to an increase in vibrations. Most of the researcher used vibration for fault detection in bearings but sometimes it caused by miss alignment in a shaft due to a fraction of overloading the machine. In this paper, we address it to solve those problems by using two parameters speed and vibration. To verify our approach, we use three different kinds of machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bays, and Random Forest. By using these machine learning algorithms, we tried to find out the relationship between machine failure due to speed and vibration by predicting good and faulty bearings. After applying these models, we have seen that the SVM has 78% accuracy as compared to Naïve Bays, and Random Forest.","AI","University of West Scotland"

This representation should be outstanding enough to prevent a speaker’s utterances from being lost in the acoustical congestion that is imposed by the rest of the talkers.For this purpose, it is proposed here, for the case of multiple-microphone diarization, multiple speech signals are used in the acoustic feature extraction instead of combining the signals beforehand. The reason is to make an optimal use of those signals in order to enrich the quality of the acoustical representation of the speaker. To this end, and since not all microphone signals (channels) may be desirable, two selection approaches are proposed in this work. These are, a best quality channel selection method and a novel approach for diverse channel selection. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed which retains the speech spectrum from selected least reverberated subbands of the available channels’ spectrums. A new model, referred to here as Averaged Joint Gradient (AJG), is introduced for this purpose. The proposed approach reduces the Diarization Error Rate (DER) in both of the diarization systems used in the evaluations. The first system is based on binary keys and achieves a maximum relative reduction in DER of 14%. The second one is a Gaussian Mixture Model-Bayesian Information Criterion (GMM-BIC) based system which achieves a maximum relative reduction in DER of 20%.","AI","University of West Scotland"

M.","9 Sept 2022","Next-generation networks are expected to combine advanced physical and digital technologies in super-high-speed connected system infrastructures, gaining critical operation competitiveness of improved efficiency, productivity and quality of services. Towards a fully digital and connected world, these platforms will enable infrastructure virtualization and support of edge processing, making emerging sectors, such as Industry 4.0, ready to exploit its full potentials. Nevertheless, the fast growth of data-centric and automated systems may exceed the capabilities of the overall infrastructure beyond the radio access networks, becoming unable to fulfil the demands of vertical sectors and representing a bottleneck. To minimize the negative effects that could affect critical services in a heavily loaded network, it is essential for network providers to deploy highly scalable and prioritisable in-network optimisation schemes to meet industry expectations in next-generation networks. To this end, this work presents a novel framework that leverages extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and eXpress Data Path (XDP) to offload network functions to reduce unnecessary overhead in the backbone infrastructure. The proposed solution is envisioned to be implemented as a Network Application (NetApp) service, which will greatly benefit the compatibility with next-generation networking ecosystem empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), advanced automation, multi-domain network slicing, and other related technologies. The achieved results demonstrate key performance improvements in terms of packet processing capacity as high as about 18 million packets per second (Mpps), system throughput up to 6.1 Mpps with 0% of packet loss, and illustrate the flexibility of the framework to adapt to multiple network policy rules dynamically on demand.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Regulating terrorist content on social media: automation and the rule of law","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/regulating-terrorist-content-on-social-media-automation-and-the-r","Macdonald, S.; Correia, S.; Watkin, A-L.","20 Jun 2019","Social-media companies make extensive use of artificial intelligence in their efforts to remove and block terrorist content from their platforms. This paper begins by arguing that, since such efforts amount to an attempt to channel human conduct, they should be regarded as a form of regulation that is subject to rule-of-law principles. The paper then discusses three sets of rule-of-law issues. The first set concerns enforceability. Here, the paper highlights the displacement effects that have resulted from the automated removal and blocking of terrorist content and argues that regard must be had to the whole social-media ecology, as well as to jihadist groups other than the so-called Islamic State and other forms of violent extremism. Since rule by law is only a necessary, and not a sufficient, condition for compliance with rule-of-law values, the paper then goes on to examine two further sets of issues: the clarity with which social-media companies define terrorist content and the adequacy of the processes by which a user may appeal against an account suspension or the blocking or removal of content. The paper concludes by identifying a range of research questions that emerge from the discussion and that together form a promising and timely research agenda to which legal scholarship has much to contribute.","AI","University of West Scotland"

The difficulty of developing vertical applications for mobile networks is however still challenging. This article proposes a new paradigm solution to significantly facilitate deploying network applications (NetApp) closer to the end user and improving the user experience, facilitated by 5G. This new paradigm leverages flexible service onboarding and composition end to end, and computation offloading to a Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) platform to meet the demanding requirements of the NetApps. A functional prototype is developed and empirical comparison is conducted to validate and evaluate the performance of a corrosion detection NetApp using artificial intelligence (AI) in three different scenarios where the application is hosted. The prototype runs this NetApp over an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) connected to a 5G network testbed, and the results offer insights into this performance improvement and elaborates how opting for this NetApp solution can help the industry. In this case, the use of this NetApp can achieve a 55.47 percent reduction in computation time and improve corrosion identification processing time by 25.5 percent.","AI","University of West Scotland"

However, no concrete consensus exists to guide teacher-student interactions in the classroom. In this work, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence as an approach in autism education to assist teachers in effective practice in developing social and educational outcomes for children with ASC. We form a protocol to systematically capture such interactions, and conduct a statistical analysis to uncover basic patterns in the collected observations, including the longer-term effect of specific teacher communication strategies on student response. In addition, we deploy machine learning techniques to predict student response given the form of communication used by teachers under specific classroom conditions and in relation to specified student attributes. Our analysis, drawn on a sample of 5460 coded interactions between teachers and seven students, sheds light on the varying effectiveness of different communication strategies and demonstrates the potential of this approach in making a contribution to autism education.","AI","University of West Scotland"

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique is also introduced to perform the weighted PCA. The weights are taken as the log-likelihood values from a fitted Single Gaussian-Background Model (SG-BM). For speech features, we show that there are large differences between feature variances which makes covariance based PCA less optimal. A comparative study of the performance of speaker recognition is presented using weighted and unweighted correlation and covariance based PCA. Extensions to improve the extraction of MFCC and LPCC features of speech are also proposed. These are Odd Even filter banks MFCC (OE-MFCC) and Multitaper-Fitted LPCC. The methodologies are evaluated for the i-vector speaker recognition system. A subset of the 2010 NIST speaker recognition evaluation set is used in the performance testing in addition to evaluations on the VoxCeleb1 dataset. A relative improvement of 44% in terms of EER is found in the system performance using the NIST data and 18% using the VoxCeleb1 dataset.","AI","University of West Scotland"

The structures of the new compounds were confirmed using extensive 1D, 2D NMR, and HRESIMS analysis. The isolated compounds were tested for their cell proliferation and migration inhibition activities against the invasive human triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and the normal human breast cell line MCF-10A. In addition, free radical scavenging activities using 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were studied. Compound 1 was the most active as an antiproliferative agent, showing a high to moderate antiproliferative effect with an IC50 value of 4.95 and 17.7 μM against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively. The antiproliferative activities of compounds 1–5 against the normal breast cell line MCF-10A were moderate to low with IC50 values of 13.91 to 27.70 μM. On the other hand, compounds 1 and 10 suppressed MDA-MB-231 cell migration in the wound-healing assay at 10 μM concentration. Meanwhile, compounds 1–5 exhibited the highest value of DPPH radical scavenging activities with an IC50 value range of 17.5–20.43 ± 0.5 μg mL−1. The pharmacophore model generated using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) for compounds 1–5 showed three hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs), one hydrogen bond donor (HBD), one aromatic ring (Aro), and one hydrophobic (Hyd.) group. The central HBA feature lies at a distance of 4.36 Å and 6.38 Å from the remaining two HBA features. Also, the HBD feature maintains a distance of 2.74 Å from the aromatic feature.

F.; Moustafa, A.; Asad, M.","2022","Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurological brain disorder marked by dementia and neurological dysfunction that affects memory, behavioral patterns, and reasoning. Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable disease that primarily affects people over 40. Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed through a manual evaluation of a patient’s MRI scan and neuro-psychological examinations. Deep Learning (DL), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has pioneered new approaches to automate medical image diagnosis. This study aims to create a reliable and efficient system for classifying AD using MRI by applying the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture for detecting AD with relatively few parameters, and the proposed solution is ideal for training a smaller dataset. This proposed model successfully distinguishes the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and shows class activation maps as a heat map on the brain. The proposed Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Network (ADD-Net) is built from scratch to precisely classify the stages of AD by decreasing parameters and calculation costs. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a significant class imbalance problem, and we exploited a synthetic oversampling technique to evenly distribute the image among the classes to prevent the problem of class imbalance. The proposed ADD-Net is extensively evaluated against DenseNet169, VGG19, and InceptionResNet V2 using precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and loss. The ADD-Net achieved the following values for evaluation metrics: 98.63%, 99.76%, 98.61%, 98.63%, 98.58%, and 0.0549% accuracy, AUC, F1-score, precision, recall, and loss, respectively.

This effect has led to a continuously expanding video streaming industry that seeks to offer enhanced quality-of-experience (QoE) to its users at the lowest cost possible. Video streaming services are now able to adapt to the hardware and network restrictions that each user faces and thus provide the best experience possible under those restrictions. The most common way to adapt to network bandwidth restrictions is to offer a video stream at the highest possible visual quality, for the maximum achievable bitrate under the network connection in use. This is achieved by storing various pre-encoded versions of the video content with different bitrate and visual quality settings. Visual quality is measured by means of objective quality metrics, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Visual Information Fidelity (VIF), and others, which can be easily computed analytically. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that although these metrics provide an accurate estimate of the statistical quality degradation, they do not reflect the viewer's perception of visual quality accurately. As a result, the acquisition of user ratings in the form of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) remains the most accurate depiction of human-perceived video quality, albeit very costly and time consuming, and thus cannot be practically employed by video streaming providers that have hundreds or thousands of videos in their catalogues. A recent very promising approach for addressing this limitation is the use of machine learning techniques in order to train models that represent human video quality perception more accurately. To this end, regression techniques are used in order to map objective quality metrics to human video quality ratings, acquired for a large number of diverse video sequences. Results have been very promising, with approaches like the Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) metric achieving higher correlations to user-acquired MOS ratings compared to traditional widely used objective quality metrics. In this chapter, we examine the performance of VMAF and its potential as a replacement for common objective video quality metrics.","AI","University of West Scotland"

We present a precise determination of E2 strength in 22Mg and its mirror 22Ne by Coulomb excitation, allowing for rigorous comparisons with theory. No-core symplectic shell-model calculations were performed and agree with the new B(E2) values while in-medium similarity-renormalization-group calculations consistently underpredict the absolute strength, with the missing strength found to have both isoscalar and isovector components.

F.","1 Jan 2012","Flax fibers, along with a number of other plant fibers, are rich in cellulose, are relatively cheap, have low density, are highly biodegradable, and are easily renewable with the potential for many composites' reinforcement. However, natural fibers are hydrophilic in nature and covered with waxy substances and pectin, which obstruct the hydroxyl groups from reacting with most binder materials, making it less attractive for reinforcement in polymer composites. Natural fibers are, therefore, usually subjected to alkaline treatment to bleach the fiber surface, swell the cell wall to enable large chemical molecules to penetrate the crystalline region, stop the moisture absorption, and increase the surface roughness. The main goal of this work is to study the effect of the alkaline treatment conditions on the mechanical properties of flax fiber. The effect of treatment parameters such as NaOH concentration, soaking time, and treatment temperature on single fiber tensile strength (TS) and Youn's Modulus (YM) was investigated. In order to optimize the properties of flax fiber, Design-Expert software was used to establish the design matrix and to analyze the experimental data. Numerical and graphical optimization techniques were used. Furthermore, the effect of alkaline treatment on surface morphology, crystallinity, and thermal properties of flax fiber was investigated. The results were processed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique, namely the Box?Behnken method. The results indicated that within the limits of treatment conditions used in this study, the proposed models predicted single fiber TS and YM adequately. In addition, DTA/TGA results showed that alkaline treatment improved thermal stability of flax fibers.","AI","University of West Scotland"

This study tested motivational qualities of messages about social distancing (those that promoted choice and agency vs. those that were forceful and shaming) in 25,718 people in 89 countries. The autonomy-supportive message decreased feelings of defying social distancing recommendations relative to the controlling message, and the controlling message increased controlled motivation, a less effective form of motivation, relative to no message. Message type did not impact intentions to socially distance, but people's existing motivations were related to intentions. Findings were generalizable across a geographically diverse sample and may inform public health communication strategies in this and future global health emergencies.","AI","University of West Scotland"

L.; Inches, G.; Raza, S.","1 Jan 2023","Cybersecurity incidents have been growing both in number and associated impact, as a result from society’s increased dependency in information and communication technologies - accelerated by the recent pandemic. In particular, IoT. technologies, which enable significant flexibility and cost-efficiency, but are also associated to more relaxed security mechanisms, have been quickly adopted across all sectors of the society, including critical infrastructures (e.g. smart grids) and services (e.g. eHealth). Gaps such as high dependence on 3rd party IT suppliers and device manufacturers increase the importance of trustworthy and secure solutions for future digital services. This paper presents ARCADIAN-IoT, a framework aimed at holistically enabling trust, security, privacy and recovery in IoT systems, and enabling a Chain of Trust between the different IoT entities (persons, objects and services). It builds on features such as federated AI for effective and privacy-preserving cybersecurity, distributed ledger technologies for decentralized management of trust, or transparent, user-controllable and decentralized privacy.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Catalytic antibodies: a new window on protein chemistry","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/catalytic-antibodies-a-new-window-on-protein-chemistry-2","Suckling, C. J.; Tedford, C. M.; Proctor, G. R.; Khalaf, A. I.; Bence, L. M.; Stimson, W. H.","1992","Catalytic antibodies have created a new dimension in protein chemistry. In these studies it is particularly valuable to investigate systems for which natural enzymic catalysts are unknown. At Strathclyde we have examined several ways of preparing homochiral building blocks for organic synthesis. Antibodies that catalyse the Diels-Alder reaction have been characterized. The target reaction was the addition of acetoxybutadiene to N-substituted maleimides, a reaction that should give a pentafunctional homochiral building block. Catalytic antibodies can give insight into the mechanism of catalysis by proteins. We have investigated an adventitious hydrolytic antibody that cleaves activated esters. We have also shown that an antibody raised to ampicillin for analytical purposes catalyses hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring.","AI","University of West Scotland"
"Influence of RF power on the stoichiometry, optical, and electrical properties of chromium oxide coatings prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering","https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/influence-of-rf-power-on-the-stoichiometry-optical-and-electrical","Oje, A. M.; Ogwu, A. A.; Oje, A. I.; Tsendzughul, N.; Ur Rahman, S.","22 Mar 2019","An investigation has been carried out on the stoichiometry, optical and electrical properties of chromium oxide thin films prepared under various deposition powers using RF magnetron sputtering technique. The elemental and chemical composition of the prepared films were characterised by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis, Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The wettability and surface energies of the thin films were investigated with a goniometer. The four-point electrical probe method was used to determine the electrical resistivity of the films while the optical properties of the films were measured with a spectrophotometer. The coatings were found to be mainly  phase based on the dominance of A1g and Eg symmetric modes in the Raman investigations and the Eu vibration mode in the FTIR measurements. The RF powers used during the deposition process were found to have played a vital role in the formation of  rich films. It was observed that higher deposition power facilitated both the dislodging of more chromium atoms from the target and dissociation of oxygen used during the deposition process. The wettability results show that the thin films are hydrophilic and interact well with water and this behaviour is linked to the contribution of the polar component to the total surface energy. Optical transmittance values exceeding 70% were obtained for the films prepared at a lower RF power. The resistivity values varied from 0.061 Ω cm to 0.152 Ω cm for the deposited chromium oxide films. The variation in the electrical resistivity and the optical transmittance of the films with RF power indicate that these film properties can be altered or tuned to suit specific applications e.g. as transparent conducting oxide (TCO) for optoelectronic devices and other similar applications.","AI","University of West Scotland"

A.; Mirzaeian, M.; Oje, A. M.; Tsendzughul, N.","15 Sept 2019","The potential of a radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtered silver (Ag) thin film electrodes, for electrochemical energy storage application is presented in this paper. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to reveal the information on the morphology and growth mode of the deposited silver thin film samples. The stoichiometry of the RF sputtered silver thin films was evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the elemental constituents of the deposited thin films were confirmed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The surface area, wettability and surface energy of silver thin film electrodes were determined, using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and contact angle measurements. Furthermore, the ion diffusion, Faradaic redox reactions and the specific capacitance of the produced Ag thin film electrodes in ionic liquid (1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) were probed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry (CV). XRD result reveals that the sputtered silver thin films are crystalline, with metallic silver been the predominant element found on the EDX spectra. The specific capacitance of 431 F/g at 2 mV/s scan rate was achieved for Ag thin film electrode produced at 350 W forward power, demonstrating its promising potential as an active electrode for supercapacitor application.","AI","University of West Scotland"
