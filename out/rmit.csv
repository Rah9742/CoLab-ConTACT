"Regulating tech-sex and managing image-based sexual abuse: an Australian perspective","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Regulating-tech-sex-and-managing-image-based-sexual/9922297012401341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Anne-Maree Farrell (External Author); Elizabeth Agnew (External Author); Samantha Hopkins (External Author); Jennifer Power (External Author)","2023","A range of technologies now exist to facilitate sexual desire, pleasure and intimacy. Colloquially known as tech-sex, the growth in the use of such technologies has created a range of new opportunities for sexual expression and connection. Alongside these benefits are harms arising out of their non-consensual use. Drawing on a case study examining management of image-based sexual abuse as part of Australia’s recently reformed online safety laws, we argue for a regulatory approach that is both facilitative in showing due respect for adult sexual agency and protective in mitigating harm caused to affected individuals. Operating along a facilitative-protective regulatory axis, such an approach offers the potential to be suitably responsive to both the opportunities and challenges faced by adult individuals who engage with such technologies.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"CASETiFY: A Disruptive Breakthrough in the Personalized Phone Accessories Industry","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/CASETiFY-A-Disruptive-Breakthrough-in-the/9922296592501341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Sihyun An (External Author); Sayoon Oh (External Author)","2023","In the world of tech accessories, the phone case is often viewed as a peripheral product–a commoditized accessory piggybacking on the innovation of mobile devices. Far from the complex electronics and sophisticated software inside phones, cases are seen as plastic shells or rubber bumpers with limited value-add. How did CASETiFY, a Hong Kong-based phone case startup, become a global sensation in this unexpected product category? This paper showcases CASETiFY by spotlighting the major factors that led the brand to success. We do so by deep-diving into CASETiFY’s various projects and initiatives and identifying three crucial phases in its history–the Value Creation phase, Value Communication phase, and Value Delivery phase. We highlight how, in each of these phases, CASETiFY leveraged on both the social aspects (e.g., brand communities, authentic brand messaging, providing a sense of belonging) and the individual aspects (e.g., self-expression, individualism) of its target consumers’ psyche to cultivate success factors such as intentional creativity, intensive branding, and the identification of consumers’ psychological needs. While extensive case studies exist on prominent tech companies, academic resources on peripheral accessories, a niche side of the tech industry, are limited. By documenting CASETiFY's fascinating journey, this case study sparks a scholarly discussion on an unconventional Asian success story. It also serves as a structured reference for commoditized-accessory businesses to learn about deriving success through challenging industry norms, recognizing overlooked opportunities and thoroughly understanding one’s target consumers.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Medium and high-tech manufacturing development and the connections to macroeconomic factors: Insights from a fast-growing market","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Medium-and-high-tech-manufacturing-development-and/9922253708201341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Tuan Nguyen (External Author); Hien Nguyen (External Author)","2023","The  medium-and  high-tech manufacturing  (MHM)  sector  has  played  a  crucial  role  in Vietnam's  economic  development.  The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  identify  the primary   factors   that   contribute   to   the   growth   of   the   medium-and   high-tech manufacturing  sector  in  Vietnam. By  applying the  autoregressive distributed lag(ARDL) method to analyze annual data from 1990 to 2020, we discovered that different macroeconomic factors affect the short-and long-term development of the MHM sector in varying ways. Specifically, digitalization and human capital have a positive influence on the growth of the MHM sector over both the short and long terms. Trade openness and  foreign  direct  investment,  however,  have  a  significant,  negative  long-term  impact on  the growth  of  the MHM  sector.  The  effect  of  financial  development  on  the  MHM sector in Vietnam is significant and positive in the short term. Our study discloses that both  the  2008–2009  global  financial  crisis  and  the  Covid-19  pandemic  positively impacted Vietnam's  MHM  sector,  as  global manufacturers  diversified  their  supply chains  and  moved  their  production  facilities  to  Vietnam  during  and  after  these events. From  the  empirical  findings,  our  study  offers  valuable  suggestions  to  the  Vietnamese government,  which  will  enable  the  country  to unlock  its  full  potential  for  MHM growth.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The DPI final report presented extensive evidence of market dominance, triggered an ongoing policy conversation about the market power of U.S. platforms in Australia, and led to far-reaching reforms aimed at redressing the power of “big tech” in Australian media and advertising. This article draws on expert interviews with 24 senior advertising professionals—conducted during and immediately after the ACCC investigation—to explore their personal and professional views on Facebook, Google, and the power of U.S. platforms in ad-tech markets. We find these professionals have nuanced understandings of the Google-Facebook “duopoly.” Recurring themes included concern about platforms’ market power, anger at their commercial practices, confidence that these platforms are growing the digital advertising market, and begrudging respect for their superior ad-tech products. These diverging views paint a conflicted picture of digital advertising in a time of transformation.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The Silicon Valley behemoth, with an operating rationale to manipulate and commodify human relations for profit, decided to make an example of a sovereign country. It did so by barring, blanking and scraping information broadly defined as news content from the pages of Australian organisations and entities hosted on the company’s site. Along with Google, Facebook reasoned that the Code imposed an ill-conceived arbitration model to determine revenue for news organisations using their platforms. News organisations, hoping to recoup classified and ad revenue lost to the platforms, argued for greater bargaining powers in negotiating with Facebook and Google.  The Code is underpinned by erroneous assumptions regarding market practices pertaining to digital platforms, entrenching the very problems it claims to address. The developments suggested ‘the curious role of the bargaining code: it’s meant to operate as a legislative threat so arbitration only happens when platforms and news outlets can’t agree. If Google keeps handing out money, this is unlikely to happen’ (Meese, 2021). With agreed government amendments made to the Code on Facebook’s ‘refriending’ of Australia (Frydenberg, 2021), two victorious parties emerged: the digital platforms and old news media.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Individuals do not have uniform access to lawyers, courts and remedies – with the most vulnerable individuals generally having the least and worst access. With this in mind, scholars and policymakers have argued for “online dispute resolution” (ODR) to expand access to justice (A2J). Although there is no generally accepted definition of ODR, it includes use of the Internet to prevent and/or resolve disputes. This means that ODR includes online problem diagnosis and self-help tools, as well as technologies to promote online negotiation, mediation, arbitration, community courts, and variations thereof. Nonetheless, ODR comes with perils and it is necessary to revamp research regarding ODR to promote A2J. This article will discuss ideas regarding ODR regulation and research – again with a goal toward expanding A2J.  ","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

However, much of Vietnam's farm production has not received a solid competitive edge in the market. Therefore, Vietnam's government has called for high-tech agricultural developments with a strong belief in rural enterprises that will benefit from its implementation and the adoption of international standards.

"Posthumanism and Assistive Technologies: on the social inclusion/exclusion of low tech cyborgs","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Posthumanism-and-Assistive-Technologies-on-the/9921863512301341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Marcelo Buzato (External Author)","2019","In this paper, we elaborate on the consequences of a post-humanist perspective to the problem of physical disability by approaching the use of assistive technologies (AT) by disabled people as the introduction of a low-tech cyborg in the world. In doing so, we highlight examples of communication ATs and provide analogies between ATs and languages in the constitution of selves and social contexts. ATs are informed ideologically, so they can be seen both as a way to fix an impaired person, or as a strategy to overcome a physical and social context that disables some people and makes other people able-bodied. We argue that becoming a low- tech cyborg can be a form of social inclusion if we understand disability to be produced by the context, rather than as an inherent dysfunctionality of the individual. Based on this assumption, we identify two strategies of social inclusion of the low-tech cyborg: disembodiment of the Self, and embodied virtuality. We remark, however, that low-tech cyborgs can be configured out of necessity or choice and add that the same socioeconomic factors that produce inequality in general are also active in the social exclusion/inclusion of the low-tech cyborg. Thus, ATs can be adopted and transformed by choice so as to broaden the gap between cyborg haves and have nots, while both kinds of cyborgs can become increasingly subject to cognitive and affective exploitation in the context of cognitive capitalism. We conclude that the potential of a post-humanist perspective to disability should not be about making impaired humans integer, nor making integer humans more than human, but keeping selves ethically connected with others whether by virtual embodiment or embodied virtuality.

We investigate what drives this variability via 17 interviews. We find that the principal driver is institutional pressures that prioritise either rigorous process or pressure from targets. Based on these drivers and responses, we provide contingency-based advice as to how firms in different contexts can get the best results from using NPD tools.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Building simplexity: the 'more or less' of post-digital architecture practice","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Building-simplexity-the-more-or-less/9921864092901341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Kristof Crolla","2018","A strong dichotomy exists between the increased architectural design agency offered by digital tools today and the affordances given by many construction contexts, especially building environments in developing countries with limited available means.<br /><br />This creative practice research project questions whether computational design tools can be used differently in contemporary architecture practice so that onsite affordances can be increased in parallel with the expanding virtual design solution space. It postulates that by incorporating incertitude as a productive and constructive component in alternative computation-driven design and materialisation methods (rather than as negatives), the locally available solution space for built architecture can be dramatically expanded and onsite ability and agency increased.<br /><br />The study develops a methodology that aims at procedurally managing serious slippage from aleatory occurrences during materialisation and transforming it into a practical opportunity for non-standard project realisation. In doing so the case is made for the use of more democratic epistemic models and more intelligent structures of approximation than (common) deterministic approaches in digital design would allow for.<br /><br />The field of study is &lsquo;Post-Digital Architectural Design Practice,&rsquo; which is characterised by virtually unlimited computational ability, precision and unprecedented access to specialised and complex processes, wherein the challenge lies in the translation of its expanded agency into professional application. The employed methodologies are &lsquo;Participatory Action Research&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reflective Practice,&rsquo; applied on an existing and developing body of creative works of increasing scale and complexity, built in volatile construction contexts. Their study identifies and challenges preconceived notions behind their creation and frames these in dialectic space for further development until higher-order knowledge is extracted in contribution to the overall field of study.<br /><br />The demonstrator employs protean design diagrams capable of absorbing serendipity throughout the project crystallisation process. Named &lsquo;vibrant objectiles,&rsquo; these diagrams consist of holistic, computation-driven, associative design models that are procedural in nature and cover both project design and delivery. They are built from a select number of interdependent components that are optimised for local implementation. These are placed in and communicate across a hierarchy of scale and impact, enabling the emergence of larger-scale complexity. They relate to aspects of project materiality, material system and/or materialisation, and can incorporate site-specific idiosyncrasies. They have potentially high levels of volatility or uncertainty, termed &lsquo;vibrancy&rsquo;. This vibrancy is managed throughout the project development, rather than locked down. From early on, the extensibility of potential deviations is harnessed within the developing objectile that incorporates continuous feedback from rigorous prototyping. Until project completion, uncertainty is given room to feed back into the system, giving rigour and animus to the whole. Hence, rather than seeing the act of design materialisation as the literal translation of digitally designed objects, the proposed method embraces fluctuations as the design develops into its final singular site-specific solution.<br /><br />Evaluation of the potential and efficacy of the proposed method challenges the role practising architects are often given and the extent of their authority within professional legal frameworks. For the proposed method to successfully bridge the dissociation between theory and practice, the architects&rsquo; mode of operation needs to change, and the extent of their actions to dramatically expand. However, once these changes are made possible, the discussed projects demonstrate that the increase of local onsite affordance can be substantial.<br />","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Conventionally, performance analysis of responsive design is evaluated using simulation of digital model. The inaccuracy of most building performance simulation leads to a huge prediction error in the actual building performance, which yields miscalculation in the building operational cost. This paper proposes a novel method for delivering a cost benefit analysis for responsive design. Two different strategies are explored in parallel. Firstly, hands-on approach through fabrication of physical models which directly associated to digital models, whereby the fabrication and operational costs of the physical prototypes are measured and monitored. Secondly, qualitative approach through cost benefit analysis of real world building projects which employ responsive architectural components.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The authors investigate how children function as socialisation agents for their parents in influencing their purchase intentions of computer and high-tech products - essentially the idea of the young educating the old. Design/methodology/approach - A review of the extant literature relating to consumer socialisation, social power and knowledge about computer related and small high-tech products yielded meaningful hypotheses. A structured survey which was required to be completed by dyads (i.e. children and parents) was mailed to Australian families in the state of Victoria. Data obtained from 180 usable responses from the dyads were analysed to test the hypotheses. Findings - Children are seen to possess expert power over their parents with regards to computer related and small high-tech products; which make them an important agent of secondary socialisation for their parents. Men are perceived as being more knowledgeable than women, a phenomenon which leads mothers to be more inclined to seek their children's (son's in particular) advice.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

A major concern is the fire behavior of FRPs, especially their thermal softening with increasing temperature and consequently the reduction of load bearing capacity with adverse impact on structural integrity. In order to improve the composite fire performance and enhance the reliability of composite applications, it is necessary to study and understand the structural response of FRPs subjected to combined thermal and mechanical loadings. Special attention has to be paid to in depth analysis of various length- and time-scales. This paper presents the results of a series of large-scale structural fire experiments with E-glass fiber/vinyl ester panels subjected to compression loading and one-sided heating. All panels had the same overall dimensions of 2100 mm in width, 3000 mm in height and 13.0 to 13.5 mm in thickness. The fire exposed side was protected with a 25 mm thick thermal insulation made of ceramic fiber wool. The panels, with as well as without Balsa wood core stiffeners, were subjected to mechanical compressive loads in the range between 10 and 50 kN . The fire scenario was in line with the ISO 834-1 standard fire and in one case with the EN 1363-2 hydrocarbon temperaturetime curve for comparison reasons. Failure times were observed from 25 minutes to no failure at 115 minutes. Measurement instrumentation, time dependent temperature profiles, failure modes, failure times etc. have been highlighted.","Tech","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Preventing plastic waste at its source has proven to be the most effective solution to the problem. This study explores a variety of factors that may contribute to SUP consumption and reduction behaviour in a convenient sample of residents living in Hoi An, a tourist coastal city in Vietnam. Using a cross-sectional design, the study reached 150 Vietnamese respondents between June and September 2022. The results revealed that subjective knowledge about plastics and plastic wastes (b = 0.391) and perceived strictness of legal consequences of inappropriate plastic disposal (b = -0.642) were two significant predictors of SUP reduction, while perceived cost advantage of plastics (b = 0.390) was the only predictor of SUP consumption. This study also found that the mean reported level of plastic consumption varied across three different parts of Hoi An City, with the residents of Cham Island (an area with active environmental action programmes) consuming significantly fewer SUP products compared to those living in urban and suburban areas. A model of motivation to reduce plastic waste was finally discussed. In conclusion, besides the traditional approach of raising public knowledge on the plastic problem, it is suggested that imposing strict penalties for inappropriate disposal and increasing the price of SUP plastics may be the most effective ways to reduce SUP plastic waste at its sources.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Application of antifouling paints or coatings adds costly and time-consuming steps and may interfere with the function of fine surface features, counteracting some of the benefits of 3D-printing technology. We measured the antifouling performance of two 3D-printing thermoplastics embedded with antifouling biocides to create 3D-printed materials with inherent antifouling properties: 1) polycaprolactone (PCL) mixed with the organic biocide dichlorooctylisothiazolinone (DCOIT) and extruded as 3D-printing filament, and 2) a commercial polylactic acid (PLA) 3D-printing filament with embedded copper powder. Settlement plates printed from these thermoplastics (“PCL-DCOIT” and “PLA-Cu”, respectively) and deployed in temperate, coastal marine water for 17 weeks during summer remained free of macrofouling. A biofilm developed, and 16S and 18S rRNA metabarcoding analyses revealed that early stage biofilms (at 5 and 12 weeks) had dramatically altered assemblage structures of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes compared to natural biofilms.

Concrete specimens were exposed in a marine environment in a port facility in southern Australia for 2 years. The specimens were subject to a range of nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques, including resistivity, Schmidt hammer, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) tests. In addition, chloride diffusion coefficients were calculated from concrete cores taken from specimens exposed in the marine environment. Microscopy analysis was undertaken using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and comparative data were taken on laboratory specimens at 28 days. Furthermore, the chloride diffusion coefficients were compared with the results of standard laboratory tests undertaken on the control samples at 28 days, including rapid chloride permeability testing (RCPT) using a 10-V driving voltage, an NT Build 492 test, and a bulk diffusion test, to determine the relationship between the 28-day laboratory tests results and the site performance. The data showed good correlation between the predicted performance based on the 28 day laboratory tests and the 2-year site data. The chloride diffusion of the ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) concrete agreed very accurately with the predicted value from the modified RCPT test, whereas the performance of FA concrete was superior to that predicted.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Flume experiments were conducted under two conditions: Condition 1 was with a fixed riser bottom, and Condition 2 was with a fixed bottom on a mooring platform. The cross-flow acceleration of the riser was measured at different current velocities, and corresponding vibration responses were analyzed. Numerical simulations based on the flume experiments were employed to validate the reliability of the simulation method. Results from the flume experiments revealed vortex-induced resonance in Condition 1 when the flow velocity approached the riser’s natural frequency. In Condition 2, similar vibration responses were observed, with maximum acceleration occurring during flow velocity-induced vortex-induced vibrations. However, at higher flow velocities, the acceleration response showed a decrease followed by an increase, indicating the excitation of higher-order modes. The numerical simulations matched the flume experiments in Condition 1. In Condition 2, while the acceleration response and frequency agreed during vortex- induced resonance, discrepancies arose in the flow velocity that caused vortex-induced vibrations compared to the flume experiments. This study demonstrated the accuracy of numerical simulations in reflecting vortex-induced vibrations of risers, providing a foundation for further research on complex riser systems.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The resistance to matter interchange was employed to allocate the optimal space for the growth of polyp colonies from the perspective of topological optimization, where the optimized structures are those of natural brain corals. Computational fluid dynamics simulations revealed that these complicated structures can provide shelter to protect polyps from ocean currents. A reverse mold was prepared from silica gel and used to cast models from mixtures of cement and calcium carbonate, where the mixture ratio was determined based on compressive strength and biocompatibility. Based on an acid corrosion experiment, the matter interchange capability was verified. This study also proved that the many folds in the structure of brain corals contribute to the circulation of seawater, thus maintaining the concentration of nutrients and hindering the deposition of harmful substances. This paper establishes an innovative methodology for the creation of artificial brain corals, which is important for environmental restoration.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

The aim is to understand the effects of ship motions including rolling, heaving, and inclination on flow field and thermal–hydraulic performance. Both forced circulation and natural circulation are taken into account since the abilities of coolant to maintain its original motion under ocean conditions are different. The temperature distribution, velocity field, and flow rate distribution of a static reactor are presented first for comparison. After additional forces or accelerations are introduced, the flow field in the marine reactors subjected to different types of ocean motions is explored. Results show that the rolling motion would have more significant impacts on marine reactors in natural circulation concerning temperature and SG (steam generator) flow rate. In natural circulation, the SG flow rate fluctuation can reach 35 kg/s when the rolling angle increases to 45°, compared to the maximum fluctuation of 8 kg/s under forced circulation. The rolling motion also greatly affects the flow field and flow rate distribution at the core inlet. Obvious vortex flows can be observed in the annulus both for forced circulation and natural circulation. The core channel with the minimum flow rate appears to be randomly located for the reactor subjected to rolling motion. For reactors in heaving motion, the fluid velocity changes periodically, and the flow rate in the SG and core regions increases significantly with the increase of the heaving period and acceleration. As for inclined reactors, the average velocity in the core becomes smaller while the temperature increases as the inclination angle of the reactor increases.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

They are responsible for high morbidity and mortality. Researchers currently pursue novel antimicrobials from natural sources against non-traditional drug targets of staphylococci to ensure a pipeline of potent drugs, in the face of rising drug resistance. The focus of this study was to screen compounds from a freshwater isolate of Chlorella sorokiniana for anti-staphylococcal activity, using traditional microbiology, phytochemical analysis and bioinformatics approaches.  Methods Chlorella sorokiniana methanol extract was investigated for its antimicrobial potential on Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC and MRSA isolates) by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion, broth microdilution, cell cytotoxicity and thin layer chromatography-bioautography (TLC-BA). Two antimicrobial TLC-BA antimicrobial fractions (A and B) were subject to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). The structures of 9 compounds representing GCMS peaks were tested in silico, for their pharmacokinetic properties and binding energy efficiency with the target, using Molinspiration tool and Autodock 4.2.  Results Mean zone diameter of inhibition of growth by CSME (20 mg) was 21 mm, MIC/MBC was 0.31/2.5 mg/L. GCMS analysis of TLC fraction-A revealed 31 phytochemicals, of which 2-pentanone,4-hydroxy-4-methyl- had the highest area % (65.61) and TLC fraction-B revealed 4 peaks of which pentadecanoic acid and 1-(+)-ascorbic acid 2,6-dihexadecanoate had the highest area % (45.57, 48.09).

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging tool for pest surveillance, allowing for the detection of genetic material shed by organisms into the environment. However, factors influencing the spatial and temporal detection limits of eDNA in marine environments are poorly understood. In this study we use eDNA assays to assess the invasive ranges of two marine pests in south-eastern Australia, the kelp Undaria pinnatifida and the seastar Asterias amurensis. We explored the temporal and spatial detection limits of eDNA under different oceanographic conditions by combining estimates of eDNA decay with biophysical modelling. Positive eDNA detections at several new locations indicate the invasive range of both pest species is likely to be wider than currently assumed. Environmental DNA decay rates were similar for both species, with a decay rate constant of 0.035 h−1 for U. pinnatifida, and a decay rate constant of 0.041 h−1 for A. amurensis, resulting in a 57–73% decrease in eDNA concentrations in the first 24 h and decaying beyond the limits of detection after 3–4 days. Biophysical models informed by eDNA decay profiles indicate passive transport of eDNA up to a maximum of 10 to 20 km from its source, with an ~90–95% reduction in eDNA concentration within 1–3 km from the source, depending on local oceanography. These models suggest eDNA signals are likely to be highly localised, even in complex marine environments. This was confirmed with spatially replicated eDNA sampling around an established U. pinnatifida population indicating detection limits of ~750 m from the source. This study highlights the value of eDNA methods for marine pest surveillance and provides a much-needed description of the spatio-temporal detection limits of eDNA under different oceanographic conditions.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

On the alloy surface under normal atmospheric conditions. The oxide film formed on the aluminium alloy surface is non-uniform, thin and non-coherent. Therefore, it imparts a certain level of protection under normal conditions. When exposed to environments containing halide ions, of which the chloride is the most frequently encountered in service, the oxide film breaks down at specific points leading to the formation of pits on the aluminium surface. This type of corrosion is known as pitting corrosion.     Traditional techniques used to evaluate corrosion and corrosion inhibitors can be time-consuming. However, high-throughput methodologies can be used to conduct a large number of simultaneous experiments in a shorter period of time than traditional assessment tests. Consequently, there is an urgent need to discover and develop new rapid screening methodologies that can be used as a preliminary screening method prior to supporting traditional electrochemical methods and computational methods to design new inhibitors.    Therefore, the aim of this research project was to develop a new rapid screening method for metals susceptible to pitting corrosion and assess the performance of corrosion inhibitors using a droplet-based technique. The Master's by research project was divided into two parts. A systematic and rapid droplet-based strategy was used in Part 1 to screen a wide range of corrosion inhibitors for AA5083 and different variations in the inhibitors’ molecular structures. Further characterization of the performance and associated mechanisms of inhibition, including any adsorption or film-forming properties, was carried out in Part 2 on selected shortlisted inhibitors.    In Part 1, a series of trials and experiments have been conducted on 21 corrosion inhibitors to figure out the optimal cleaning methods, surface preparation and condition of using optical profilometry to assess droplets of the inhibitors. While in Part 2, a series of methods were used, including electrochemical and surface characterization, to reveal the long-term performance of two promising inhibitors that were selected from the droplets’ study.     Overall, the thesis successfully establishes several significant findings over the course of this master’s by Research project, developing a high throughput droplet-based technique, revealing its advantages and limitations in the evaluation of pitting corrosion and corrosion inhibitors of AA5083.     The main outcome of this thesis is providing a new high throughput screening tool that will help the corrosion community in screening new corrosion inhibitors in a rapid and effective way.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Here, we used biologging devices to follow Manx Shearwaters Puffinus puffinus, a long-lived seabird with a trans-Atlantic loop migration, from before their first migration until their 3rd calendar year. We found that Shearwaters undertake first migration without their parents, setting off almost immediately upon fledging and moving along a more direct trajectory than adults, before wintering in the same part of the South Atlantic as adult conspecifics and subsequently iteratively developing their return migration route over the next 3 years, each time returning – unlike adults – via a Western Atlantic route. We propose that the first outbound migration in Manx Shearwaters is broadly consistent with a genetically inherited vector, that both the outbound and the return migration trajectories are unlikely to be learnt from experienced conspecifics, and that return migration in Manx Shearwaters (and perhaps loop migrants more generally) may be informed by genetically inherited information and/or local environmental conditions.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Wastewater treatment plants can act as entrance routes for NPs/MPs to the aquatic environment as they breakdown of larger fragments of the plastic component during the treatment process; therefore, it is necessary to remove NPs/MPs during the wastewater treatment process. In this study, understanding the effect of water shear force on the fragmentation of larger size MPs into smaller MPs and NPs and their removal by air flotation and nano-ferrofluid (i.e., magnetite and cobalt ferrite particle as a coagulant) and membrane processes were investigated as a proof-of-concept study. It is found that a two-blade mechanical impeller could fragment MPs from 75, 150 and 300 μm into mean size NPs/MPs of 0.74, 1.14 and 1.88 μm, respectively. Results showed that the maximum removal efficiency of polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polyester was 85, 82 and 69%, respectively, in the air flotation process. Increasing the dose of behentrimonium chloride surfactant from 2 to 10 mg/L improved the efficiency of the air flotation process for NPs/MPs removal. It is also found that the removal efficiency of NPs/MPs by the air flotation system depends on solution pH, size, and types of NPs/MPs. This study also found a less significant removal efficiency of NPs/MPs by both types of ferrofluid used in this study with an average removal of 43% for magnetite and 55% for cobalt ferrite. All three plastics tested had similar removal efficiency by the nano-ferrofluid particles, meaning that this removal technique does not rely on the plastic component type. Among all the process tested, both ultrafiltration and microfiltration membrane processes were highly effective, removing more than 90% of NPs/MPs fragment particles.

The effect of different types of a coagulant such as alum and polyacrylamide (PAM), dosages of coagulants, solution pH and weathering conditions was investigated for the removal of MPs. Results found that a combination of alum and PAM performed better than standalone coagulant for MPs removal. The removal of all three types of MPs was high at low pH (3–5). It is also found that the removal efficiency of LDPE, HDPE and PP was 92 %, 84 % and 96 %, respectively under the weathering conditions.

Properties of SGPC-M in the marine environment including chloride resistance, absorption characteristics, and the scaling effect were examined and compared with ordinary Portland Cement concrete (OPC-M) properties in the same environment. The test results indicate that the SGPC-M has a lower resistance to chloride penetration than the OPC- M concrete. Compared to the OPC-M, higher values of diffusion coefficient and lower values of chloride binding capacity were obtained for the SGPC-M concrete. Besides, the study on the pore characteristics and absorption behaviour of the concrete indicates that the SGPC-M possesses more pores than the OPC-M, which is related to the lower resistance to chloride penetration in the marine environment. Furthermore, the microstructural changes due to chloride attack in the SGPC-M are different than the changes in the OPC-M concrete, which was identified from the SEM and XRD analysis.","Marine","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

This has led to a series of decisions being made that have addressed problems in the short term but have not adequately considered long term implications. More often than not, Government directives to deliver improved efficiencies come along with a corresponding budget cut, a direction to maintain services and capability without any real guidance on how this could or should be achieved and this continues to impact on the organisation long after the incumbent Government has left office.

Standard techniques for state tomography are incapable of tracking changing states and often perform poorly in the presence of environmental noise. Although there are different approaches to solve these problems theoretically, experimental demonstrations have so far been sparse. Our approach, matrix-exponentiated gradient (MEG) tomography, is an online tomography method that allows for state tracking, updates the estimated density matrix dynamically from the very first measurements, is computationally efficient, and converges to a good estimate quickly even with very noisy data. The algorithm is controlled via a single parameter, its learning rate, which determines the performance and can be tailored in simulations to the individual experiment. We present an experimental implementation of MEG tomography on a qutrit system encoded in the transverse spatial mode of photons. We investigate the performance of our method on stationary and evolving states, as well as significant environmental noise, and find fidelities of around 95% in all cases.","AI","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"
"Augmented agency: approaches for enhancing the capabilities of generative architectural design processes","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Augmented-agency-approaches-for-enhancing-the/9922258312601341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Dasong WANG","2023","Over the past several decades, generative design methodologies have significantly enriched the possibilities and innovations of architectural design processes, catalyzing unprecedented tectonic manifestations and spatial qualities. However, this design paradigm still faces a series of limitations preventing its extensive application in design practice when dealing with sophisticated design intentions and unpredictable design scenarios. Simultaneously, the explosive development of emerging technologies, such as Deep Learning, offers enormous and unexplored possibilities for the design methodology driven by technological innovations. Thus, the dissertation critically reflects on generative design’s inherent constraints and its correlation with emerging technologies in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to push the boundaries of the methodology for achieving enhanced and previously unattainable performances.    The research is positioned in a community of practice and academy focusing on generative methodology, algorithmic techniques, digital fabrications, and Machine Learning applications. Based on the main concerns and intentions, the research adopts a mode that combines practice-based research with speculative explorations of unfamiliar technologies. Specifically, the speculative explorations involve critical reflections on the inherent limitations of generative design and analysis of its correlated characteristics with AI technologies. The consequent emerging concepts and design approaches are applied to structure or augment the design processes of experimental and collaborative projects conducted in the RMIT Architecture Tectonic Formation Lab for practical validation and optimization.    The dissertation establishes a methodology entitled Augmented Agency, which includes a theoretical argument of generative design’s Augmented Inclination, two original design approaches, and a series of forward-looking research directions.     The argument of Augmented Inclination reveals two conceptual shifts. The first occurs in the overall intentional tendency of applying generative design, from the exploration of unprecedented generative systems to the enhancement of their capabilities and performances in practice. The second shift refers to the functional role of Machine Learning in generative design, from a generator to an augmenter. The two perspectives are proposed based on a series of propositions that encompass reviews of the evolution of generative design, identification of its inherent limitations, and its correlation with different types of Machine Learning frameworks.    As one of the approaches, Physical Adapting employs a deductive method to augment generative systems’ capacity to accommodate various fabricating and material criteria. It embeds these physical requirements within a synthesized generative process negotiating with multiple hierarchies of design intentions, significantly improving the fabrication quality with broadened design possibilities. Furthermore, the dissertation proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based design approach, defined as Intuitive Cultivating. It trains a generative system to form intuitions and makes optimal generative decisions by observing real-time conditions. Unlike the conventional single-run generative process, the emerging approach adopts a mode of comprehensive training and universal application, which augments generative systems with superior capacity accommodating sophisticated design intentions and unpredictable environments. Additionally, two potential research trajectories, Collaborative Intuitions and Intuitive Robotics, are outlined in the dissertation. They elucidate the possibility of applying the above-mentioned Artificial Generative Intuition concepts to the collaboration of generative systems and robotic fabrication, respectively.    The critical reflections, emerging concepts, and approaches presented in the dissertation broaden the existing knowledge framework of generative design methodology. Specifically, the Augmented Inclination argument with the two conceptual shifts identifies the core concerns for the future development of this methodology. The Physical Adapting approach expands the possibilities for generative systems and enables them to accommodate various fabricating methods to achieve unprecedented geometric complexity. Intuitive Cultivating is a groundbreaking approach that systematically introduces Reinforcement Learning into generative design processes. As an emerging design paradigm, it offers solutions to address the existing limitations of generative design and enables generative systems to be more widely and efficiently applied to sophisticated design scenarios.    From a macro perspective, the exploration of Machine Learning (ML) in the dissertation has significant implications for bridging the architectural discipline with cutting-edge technological achievements. Unlike its straightforward applications[ The straightforward ML applications refer to the research that directly applies AI techniques with specific usages to the architectural field—for instance, the research employing GAN-related algorithms for generating architectural images, Etc. Section 1.3 articulates critical reflections on these AI-applying methods.] to design practice, the research systematically analyses different ML frameworks' mechanismic characteristics and correlations with architectural design logic. These reflections establish a cognitive foundation, which contributes as guidelines and insights for the researchers attempting to explore a broad range of ML applications in the architecture discipline.     Ultimately, Augmented Agency catalyzes the emergence of a more capable and intuitive design methodology, which signifies a closer correlation between humans and computational intelligence.","AI","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Most filter-level network pruning algorithms focus on minimizing the impact of pruning on network performance using either importance-based or similarity-based pruning approaches. However, no study has attempted to compare the effectiveness of the two approaches across different network configurations and datasets. To address these issues, this paper compares two explainable network pruning methods based on importance-based and similarity-based approaches to understand their key benefits and limitations. Based on the analysis findings, we propose an innovative hybrid pruning method and demonstrate its effectiveness using several models and datasets. The comparisons with other state-of-the-art filter pruning methods show the superiority of the new hybrid method.","AI","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

We show that workers and GAI represent two distinct but interdependent sides of the production, that jointly generate a network externality in learning that drives productivity. We find that in open learning organizations favoring the worker-GAI interaction, GAI should be matched to workers based on their ability to detect errors. We analyze configurations where the worker-GAI interaction is limited, referred as closed learning organizations, including firms banning the use of GAI, technological superclusters and emergence of small entrepreneurs innovating with GAI.","AI","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

"Developing machine learning and data mining techniques for fuel loss detection at service stations","https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/graduate/Developing-machine-learning-and-data-mining/9922253613401341?institution=61RMIT_INST","Servet KOCAK","2023","This research aims to develop effective machine-learning algorithms for detecting unexpected volume changes and identifying their potential error sources in underground storage tanks (USTs) in service stations. Detecting fuel losses has been one of the significant challenges all over the world. Many site operators utilise sensors placed at strategic locations around their service station to collect data and identify potential fuel loss issues. However, the fluctuating weather conditions across Australia, the differences in fuel composition, and the inaccuracies in measurement equipment might cause fuel loss and gain in the tank, and it is very difficult to identify these unexpected volume changes. Leaks, one of the most essential and crucial types of fuel loss, can have a devastating impact on the environment and pose significant health risks to human lives. Existing leak detection systems based on Statistical Inventory Reconciliation (SIR) analysis mainly use rudimentary statistical models. Thus, they may be slow to identify unexpected volume changes and fail to capture small loss behaviour. In summary, there is a pressing need for the establishment of better loss detection systems. Additionally, investigating all the loss-related alarms can waste time, resources, and money, whereas ignoring critical alarms might compromise site compliance and cause environmental damage. Thus, identifying the potential underlying error source of the alarm and speeding up the alarm investigation process for the technicians is necessary.    In this study, the fuel loss problem is approached as an anomaly detection task on multivariate time series data. A novel methodology that integrates algorithmic and systemic design principles is presented to identify and diagnose anomalies by triggering alarms and pinpointing potential sources of errors, with the ultimate goal of comprehending the underlying causes of the detected anomalies. The architecture of this system design consists of four main stages: (1) Data Collection, (2) Data Pre-processing, (3) Anomaly Detection, and (4) Anomaly Diagnosis and Explainability. The study utilises three primary sensor data sources that exhibit various data problems and inaccuracies. As such, the Data Pre-processing stage includes three preliminary data pre-processing phases and two additional steps to prepare the data for modelling. Our results show that the provided comprehensive data pre-processing framework enhances the quality of sensor data and enables more effective anomaly detection.    Based on a thorough literature review, the Anomaly Detection stage employs algorithms such as the statistical model “TUBE” algorithm, which is specifically designed for leak detection to compare its performance with current industry practices. On the other hand, we evaluated some of the most commonly utilised anomaly detection algorithms, such as the traditional machine learning model “OC-SVM” and the deep learning model “LSTM-AE”. This study introduces a new methodology for identifying loss behaviour as a collective anomaly detection issue. By utilising multivariate deep learning algorithms, the study demonstrates that this approach surpasses current industry methods in terms of detecting fuel loss at lower fuel leak rates. This finding suggests that the proposed methodology can detect fuel loss behaviour at an earlier stage than current industry practices due to the gradually incremental nature of fuel loss.     The Anomaly Diagnosis and Explainability stage aims to determine the alarm error source categories for the anomaly periods and to reduce alarm resolution time for industry practitioners. In this stage, the focus is on explaining the alarms generated by the LSTM-AE model through feature importance-based, distance-based and SHAP-based explainability models. The results of this project have the potential to increase productivity and provide effective techniques for accurately detecting fuel losses in USTs and determining the underlying causes of fuel loss alarms.","AI","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

This study, however, assesses the influence on degradation of coastal exposure for concrete beams, level of utilization for rendered cement floors, and rainfall for timber windows. First, the difference between random data and data categorized on the basis of high or low levels of environmental factors was explored to establish whether they had a perceptible influence on degradation. Next, five types of models were explored for fitting the data and making predictions: namely Markov chain, multiple linear regression, simple neural network, deep neural network, and random forest. Among the environmental factors, coastal exposure on concrete beams had the greatest influence, while rainfall on timber windows the least. Random forest modeling was the most accurate and was also explored using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) technique, which revealed that the environmental factor effects were more evident during the mid-life of elements rather than at the early or late stages. Including environmental factors in degradation models in addition to element age will increase their accuracy and portability.","AI","Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology"

Machine learning models have recently advanced and been integrated into data analytics, allowing researchers and practitioners to make sense of large and complex data and extract relevant insights and patterns. Financial institutions can use machine learning models to identify potential borrowers who may fail to meet financial obligations and to take appropriate action to avoid such situations. Such predictive analysis is termed credit risk analysis and is extensively used by lending organizations. In this case, financial and other information about potential borrowers is gathered from various sources and supplied to machine learning models, which may estimate a lender’s eligibility and categorize them accordingly. Although these models predict problematic or safe borrowers with high accuracy, they provide no rationale or explanation for their judgments. As a result, these models are commonly misinterpreted, and the process is typically implemented as a black-box model, in which the model accepts data as input and produces some output without explaining the decision-making process. Nonetheless, because regulated financial services must utilize a transparent decision-making process, machine learning models’ explainability becomes crucial for acceptable adoption. Recently, researchers addressed this issue by offering explainability techniques that can explain the decision-making process of machine learning models, which will encourage financial institutions to employ machine learning models for data analytics.
