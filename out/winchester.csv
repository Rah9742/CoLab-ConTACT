"Human-First, Please: Assessing Citizen Views and Industrial Ambition for Emotional AI in Recommender Systems","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/human-first-please-assessing-citizen-views-and-industrial-ambitio","Laffer, A.","3 Jul 2023","This paper qualitatively explores the views of diverse members of the British public on applications of biometric emotional AI technologies patented by two globally dominant consumer-facing recommender systems, Amazon and Spotify. Examining Amazon and Spotify patents for biometric profiling of users’ emotions, disposition, and behaviour to offer them tailored services, ads, and products from their wider platforms, this paper points to industrial ambition regarding emotional AI. Little is known about ordinary people’s views on deployment of such technology, and given the complex, abstract, and future-facing nature of such technologies, ascertaining informed lay views is hard. We address this through our innovative, qualitative study of diverse British-based adults (n=46) that presents to them near-horizon use cases in an interactive fictional narrative that deploys design fiction principles and ContraVision techniques. We find the themes of “usefulness,” “resignation,” “uneasy terms of engagement,” and “human-first,” adding rich and nuanced insights to prior survey work on users’ views towards biometric-based emotional AI technologies. In contributing to a richer understanding of whether emotional AI technologies should be deployed in consumer-facing recommender systems, and if so, on what terms, we find that well-established policy-friendly criticisms apply to global emotional AI recommender systems. We conclude, however, that problems of alienation and need for a human-first approach to emerging AI technology are the most significant criticisms.","AI","University of Winchester"

It uses a series of design fictions with 46 UK based participants, unpacking their perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of tracking the emotional state of workers. The scenario focuses on mundane uses of biometric sensing in a sales environment, and how this could shape management approaches with workers. The paper structure is as follows: section 1 provides a brief introduction; section 2 provides an overview of the innovative design fiction methodology; section 3 explores wider shifts around IT in the workplace; section 4 provides some legal analysis exploring emergence of AI in the workplace; and section 5 presents themes from the study data. The latter section includes discussion on concerns around functionality and accuracy of affective computing systems, and their impacts on surveillance, human agency, and worker/management interactions.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Using an Online Narrative Approach to Explore Diverse Participants’ Understanding of Emerging Technology: Citizen’s Perspectives on Living With Emotional AI","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/using-an-online-narrative-approach-to-explore-diverse-participant","Laffer, A.","1 Mar 2022","This case study moves beyond traditional focus groups to introduce an innovative approach to collecting rich qualitative data from participants in an online setting. Its key challenge was to quickly explain a set of emerging technologies to diverse lay participants in a clear and engaging way to elicit their views. It proposes the use of a multimodal narrative created through Twine, an interactive fiction writing tool. The narrative was developed drawing on ideas and concepts from Design Fiction, chiefly the use of diegetic prototypes, and incorporates elements of ContraVision, a method that has been found to encourage a greater range of responses.This work emerges from a larger research project seeking to understand citizen views on Emotional Artificial Intelligence (EAI) and whether they see a way to “live well” with it. Introducing an unfamiliar topic can cause issues for participants, limiting discussion or contributing to a focus on technical aspects rather than the practicalities and impacts of actually using the technology. By taking this narrative approach, participants were able to better engage with the implications of living with emergent technologies.This case study will examine why these approaches were selected and how they were implemented to encourage empathic immersion in the world of the narrative and surface specific issues. While the overall approach was highly successful, I include suggestions for improvement and some caveats to its use, focusing on potential skill and time/effort requirements.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Dark Patterns and Epistemic Ignorance: an Educational Crisis","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/dark-patterns-and-epistemic-ignorance-an-educational-crisis","Stockman, C.","Dec 2022","In this paper, we discuss how online AI stimulates epistemic ignorance. Early visions of online information search and retrieval processes proposed a utopian and empowering space for individuals. Today’s crisis paradoxically presents us with an unprecedented accumulation of new information and access to it, yet also the colonisation of this knowledge by those who seek to erode critical thought. By ‘epistemic ignorance’, we mean the condition which is systematically created by the patterns of mis- and disinformation that prevent knowledge seekers from gaining verified knowledge. We argue not only has the ‘knower’ or knowledge seeker become the ‘known’ (sometimes without knowing it), their ability ‘to know’ is also intentionally manipulated by dark patterns. Moreover, their ‘known’ status allows for their subtle indoctrination, and erosion of criticality. This makes the crisis an educational one. To illustrate, we consider epistemic mechanisms on Facebook pertaining to the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic. We contend these ‘dark AI patterns’ intentionally aim for systemic indoctrination, and affective indoctrination, by engaging in the construction of epistemic ignorance. Our focus is on the political agenda; which is common in the wider discussion of indoctrination in education. Many educational philosophers have taken a critical interest in the power of education to indoctrinate. The formal educational space is an effective vehicle to do so – and now the informal education we receive through social media is as well. Through algorithms, we are taught to think a certain way. This new crisis has not yet been considered an educational one, while in every moment, the coercive powers of online AI drive audiences towards greater uncritical acceptance of knowledge and information. Perhaps we can reverse the educational oppression with the introduction of ‘light patterns’.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Politics of Technology or Technology of Politics?","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/politics-of-technology-or-technology-of-politics","Stockman, C.","22 Oct 2020","The Western-based utopian dream of internet-enabled technology was to overcome distance, allow widespread participation, and forge a shared view of core political issues on complex matter such as justice, economy, and the environment. Politics increasingly takes to social media platforms, enlisting them as tools for gauging and influencing public opinion. This is the case for the Rousseau platform in Italy, designed by the popular anti-establishment party in Italy, ‘M5S’ or the Five Star Movement. In reference to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in particular his ‘Social Contract’, it promises to deliver politics more directly to the people by proposing legislation in the online space, allowing members to vote via the platform, educating on and discussing regulations, and more. It aligns well with political utopias envisioned by the internet pioneers. The emancipatory potential and political power that AI brings to these platforms, their political developers, and the membership, is immediately apparent. But is there not a darker side to these technologies, as they become more advanced in gathering and analysing data, making intelligent predictions, and subsequently manipulating cognitive tendencies for the purpose of politics? We discuss some of the critiques and technical functions that may cast reasonable doubt on the participatory ideals, particularly related to relational surveillance as a dystopian issue. This may remind us of the Cambridge Analytica effect; but the influence of AI on these political platforms is not (yet) a criminal offence. Can AI enable the direct democracy which internet pioneers envisioned, or is it actually bringing us the totalitarian nightmare of the ‘Brave New World’? If we harness AI to bring about greater democracy, individual empowerment, and emancipation of societies - this would bring about better worlds. But these tools so easily become corrupt. Is there not a darker side to these technologies, as they become more advanced in surveillance practices, making intelligent predictions, andsubsequently manipulating cognitive tendencies for the purpose of politics?","AI","University of Winchester"
"Performing that which exceeds us: aesthetics of  sincerity and obscenity during the 'refugee crisis'","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/performing-that-which-exceeds-us-aesthetics-of-sincerity-and-obsc","","10 Apr 2018","Focusing on examples from theatre (On the Move festival, London International Festival of Theatre/Royal Court Theatre, London 2016), film (Gianfranco Rosi’s Fuoccoamare, 2016) and the visual arts (Ai Weiwei’s Safe Passage, Berlin 2016), this article proposes that in order to think through questions of efficacy and value of performance that seeks to engage with the pain of others, we must consider the interrelation of migration and excess. I explore the multiple meanings and performances of excess in artistic practice and interrogate the contradictions and potentialities that emerge in works that perform excess as a form of what Judith Butler and Athena Athanasiou have defined as ‘political responsiveness’. In an attempt at understanding excess as a sensibility that underpins the ethics and politics of performance in response to the ‘refugee crisis’, the article focuses on two interrelated areas: the aesthetics of the sincere and the obscene. In doing so, I attempt to offer a way of thinking of the performance of ‘refugee crisis’ as excess in the logic of the neoliberal system, which perpetuates that system.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Blurring the moral limits of data markets: biometrics, emotion and data dividends","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/blurring-the-moral-limits-of-data-markets-biometrics-emotion-and-","Laffer, A.","12 Aug 2023","This paper considers what liberal philosopher Michael Sandel coins the ‘moral limits of markets’ in relation to the idea of paying people for data about their biometrics and emotions. With Sandel arguing that certain aspects of human life (such as our bodies and body parts) should be beyond monetisation and exchange, others argue that emerging technologies such as Personal Information Management Systems can enable a fairer, paid, data exchange between the individual and the organisation, even regarding highly personal data about our bodies and emotions. With the field of data ethics rarely addressing questions of payment, this paper explores normative questions about data dividends. It does so by conducting a UK-wide, demographically representative online survey to quantitatively assess adults’ views on being paid for personal data about their biometrics and emotions via a Personal Information Management System, producing a data dividend, a premise which sees personal data through the prism of markets and property. The paper finds diverse attitudes based on socio-demographic characteristics, the type of personal data sold, and the type of organisation sold to. It argues that (a) Sandel’s argument regarding the moral limits of markets has value in protecting fundamental freedoms of those in society who are arguably least able to (such as the poor); but (b) that contexts of use, in particular, blur moral limits regarding fundamental freedoms and markets.","AI","University of Winchester"

"On the feasibility of using electronic textiles to support embodied learning","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/on-the-feasibility-of-using-electronic-textiles-to-support-embodi","","2019","Electronic Textiles (e-textiles) have already proven their practical use in wearable garments, and are now also beginning to feature in non-wearable items, such as in furniture and shared surfaces inside a smart home or driverless car        interiors. E-textiles, whether worn or not, have the potential support their users’ embodied learning on a variety of topics. Embodied learning can be supported with e-textiles being part of an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, providing contextual information within a network capturing traces of behavioural and even biological data about its users.Individuals’ “digital identity” expands as the number of connected devices each individual possesses grows. Furthermore, using Artificial Intelligence (AI), increasingly personalised experiences can be tailored to users through the very devices they interact with.  To ensure e-textiles’ data can be useful for this purpose e-textiles need to be engineered to integrate with everyday activities and lifestyles. In particular, this chapter will examine e-textiles’ potential to be used as pedagogical conduit to facilitate individualised embodied learning experiences.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Researching Organisational Change in Higher Education: A Holistic Tripartite Approach","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/researching-organisational-change-in-higher-education-a-holistic-","","30 Oct 2018","In the UK context, it is important to acknowledge that there are multiple change drivers in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) that result in a proliferation of foci. Gornitzka (1999) and Allen (2003) suggest that the distinctiveness of governance, professional autonomy and the tradition of academic freedom in HEIs should be reflected in change processes, and therefore traditional frameworks for change could be adapted in an attempt to research and manage change. This paper explores how theoretical and practical tools for managing and researching change can be integrated in order to support change, whilst reflecting on the methods used. The journey of the authors towards the development of a holistic framework for researching and supporting change in Higher Education (HE), with a focus on two HEIs, is explored. The synergies of Lean Management (Wincel and Krull, 2013), Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider and Srivastva 1987), and Participatory Action Research (Greenwood et al, 1993) are examined through three stages of practice-based fieldwork to establish their positioning within a holistic tripartite framework for researching and supporting organizational change. The benefits and challenges of this framework are discussed with attention to the importance of future research to provide more evidence of the impact of this framework.","AI","University of Winchester"

Participants (n = 12) were lecturers in higher education and were required to mark two undergraduate student essays. The first student essay that all participants marked was the control essay. Participants were informed that the control essay was written by Samuel Jones (a male student). Participants then marked the target essay. Although participants marked the same essay, half of the participants (n = 6) were informed that the student essay was written by Natasha Brown (a female student), while the remaining participants were informed that it was written by James Smith (a male student). In-text and end-of-text feedback were qualitatively analysed on six dimensions: academic style of writing; criticality; structure, fluency and cohesion; sources used; understanding/knowledge of the subject; and other. Analysis of feedback for both the control and target essay revealed no discernible differences in the number of comments (strengths of the essay, areas for improvement) made and the content and presentation of these comments between the two groups. Pedagogical implications pertaining to the potential impact of anonymous marking on feedback processes are discussed.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Blockchain, Facebook and a Polygraph","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/blockchain-facebook-and-a-polygraph","Stockman, C.","22 Oct 2020","The blockchain technology is a technology that makes use of a set cryptographic primitives that allow it to store information by consensus of the nodes disregarding a central trustly part. These mechanisms also make the stored information unalterable, and allow it to be verified in a quick way. This technology allows us to relate intangibles like truth, consensus and security.  Here lies the point of this paper. We aim to develop a polygraph app that can work in social networks using the users of the social network previously registered in the app as the nodes of a blockchain. Using the Nash equilibrium and techniques of Artificial intelligence we already create a mechanism of consensus to the nodes that allow them to register information in the ledger.  As the value of the truth is one of the great problems nowadays in platforms of social networks we develop and present an architecture to work in facebook as the first application. The architecture is ethical by design, inspired by the moral formalism of Immanuel Kant. Truth, and lying, were central concerns to his philosophy. The principles of his ethics can be implemented into blockchain technology so we establish a technology which upholds truth as a formal duty between people, by detecting falsehoods spread on social media. This ethical coding would in principle enable society to protect the rationality and dignity of its citizens. This is a small step towards the possibility of greater ethics en-coded in the practices of our digital world, whilst we do discuss and recognise the many technical and conceptual complexities – such as the nature of ‘truth’ and ‘ethics’ in itself, especially given Kant’s hard-lined philosophy. However, Kant's universality of thinking aligns well with the logic of computing; therefore ethical formalism appears to be a suitable first step in the exploration of philosophically inspired truth judgements in blockchain technology.","AI","University of Winchester"

This article argues that such cultural products partake of a broader process of constructing a normative, ‘consensual’, and inherently conservative notion of Italian national identity for the twenty-first century. The chapter will combine two lines of enquiry. Firstly, it will situate these television products in the longterm history of conflicting and often mutually exclusive memory cultures in Italy, each vying for recognition in the public arena throughout the twentieth century. These fractured memory cultures find a common ground in the oft-mentioned myth of the ‘good Italian’. In the context of this long history, the article will then explore the challenge to fixed notions of Italian identity represented by the recent wave of immigration to the country, and television’s insufficient engagement with these developments. In exploring the place of Holocaust narratives in contemporary Italian television, this article examines the medium’s role as public historian and purveyor of far-from-neutral cultural values in a specific moment of the country’s history.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Curious about threats: Morbid curiosity and interest in conspiracy theories","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/curious-about-threats-morbid-curiosity-and-interest-in-conspiracy","Stubbersfield, J.","26 Sep 2023","Conspiracy theories allege secret plots between two or more powerful actors to achieve an outcome, sometimes explaining important events or proposing alternative understandings of reality in opposition to mainstream accounts, and commonly highlight the threat presented by the plot and its conspirators. Research in psychology proposes that belief in conspiracy theories is motivated by a desire to understand threats and is predicted by increased anxiety. Morbid curiosity describes the tendency to seek out information about threatening or dangerous situations, is associated with an interest in threat-related entertainment and increased anxiety. Across three studies we investigated the relationship between morbid curiosity and conspiracy theories in US-bases samples. We found that higher trait morbid curiosity was associated with higher general conspiracist beliefs (Study 1) and the perceived threat of conspiratorial explanations of events (Study 2). Using a behavioural choice paradigm, we found that participants who chose to investigate morbidly curious stimuli were more likely to choose to learn about conspiratorial explanations for events (Study 3). Greater curiosity about the minds of dangerous people was consistently the strongest predictor of conspiratorial ideation and interest. These results suggest that morbid curiosity is an important but hitherto unstudied predictor of conspiratorial interest and belief.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Do measures of memory, language, and attention predict eyewitness memory in children with and without autism","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/do-measures-of-memory-language-and-attention-predict-eyewitness-m-3","","2 Aug 2017","Background & aims.  There are few investigations of the relationship between cognitive abilities (memory, language and attention) and children’s eyewitness performance in typically developing children (TD), and even fewer in children on the autism spectrum.  Such investigations are important to identify key cognitive processes underlying eyewitness recall, and assess how predictive such measures are compared to non-verbal IQ, diagnostic group status (autism or TD) and age.   Methods.  A total of 272 children (162 boys; 110 girls) age 76 months to 142 months (M = 105 months) took part in this investigation: 71 children with autism and 201 TD children.  The children saw a staged event involving a minor mock crime and were asked about what they had witnessed in an immediate Brief Interview.  This focused on free recall, included a small number of open-ended questions, and was designed to resemble an initial evidence gathering statement taken by police officers arriving at a crime scene.  Children were also given standardised tests of intelligence, memory, language and attention.   Results & conclusions.  Despite the autism group recalling significantly fewer items of correct information than the TD group at Brief Interview, both groups were equally accurate in their recall: 89% of details recalled by the TD group and 87% of the details recalled by the autism group were correct.  To explore the relationship between Brief Interview performance and the cognitive variables, alongside age, diagnostic group status and non-verbal IQ, multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted, with Brief Interview performance as the dependant variable.  Age and diagnostic group status were significant predictors of correct recall, whereas non-verbal IQ was less important.  After age, non-verbal IQ and diagnostic group status had been accounted for, the only cognitive variables that were significant predictors of Brief Interview performance were measures of memory (specifically, memory for faces and memory for stories).  There was little evidence of there being differences between the autism and TD groups in the way the cognitive variables predicted the Brief Interview.    Implications.  The findings provide reassurance that age – the most straightforward information to which all relevant criminal justice professionals have access – provides a helpful indication of eyewitness performance.  The accuracy of prediction can be improved by knowing the child’s diagnostic status (i.e., whether the child is on the autism spectrum), and further still by using more specific assessments (namely memory for faces and memory for stories), possibly via the input of a trained professional.  Importantly, the findings also confirm that whilst children with autism may recall less information than TD children, the information they do recall is just as accurate.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Creating space for dialogue: Exploring what matters for children on St Helena Island through The World Café","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/creating-space-for-dialogue-exploring-what-matters-for-children-o","Ball (Dibben), K.","2 Sep 2023","The World Café (TWC) method is now established as a participatory tool used in community development and qualitative research. However, there is a limited critique of TWC as a social work research method, especially with children. This paper discusses TWC as a method for understanding what matters for children on the British Overseas Territory of St Helena Island. As a social worker, the importance of supporting children’s engagement and voice is well known in participation, necessitating careful ethical consideration. Within this project facilitating authentic conversations with children on a remote island required examining assumptions alongside engaging with colonial legacies to bring forward respectful participation. TWC shares several fractures of other participatory approaches evolving from critical pedagogy, which appeared aligned with social work values and ethics. Facilitated shared learning and allowed children to discuss issues that mattered to them, although handing over dialogue to children required commitment to trust and sharing control with young people. Café events revealed the complex positioning of social roles situating lived experiences, whereby children developed their learning of what mattered to them through interactions and a growing understanding of their global position. The method edged dialogue towards transformative conversations, acknowledging the oppression of marginalised peoples, requires reflection and action from children and young people themselves to elevate their positions from within their own knowledge. This supports the potential for further research to understand if creative methods can create more spaces for dialogue, allowing the emergence of more authentic children’s engagement in research which is more socially just.","AI","University of Winchester"

These are estimated by using recent advances in the literature on panel autoregressive distributed lag models. Two key results emerge: firstly, consistent with ‘search for yield’ investment behaviour, weaker balance sheet conditions, measured by the lower funding level of pension funds, positively affect the asset allocation to emerging markets. Secondly, the accumulation of reserves by emerging markets is a significant attractor of foreign institutional investment.","AI","University of Winchester"

Risk of bias was assessed using version two of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised controlled trials or the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. The study findings were grouped and synthesised following the synthesis without meta-analysis framework.Results:Eleven community-based health literacy interventions for parents were identified. Study design included randomised controlled trials (n = 4), non-randomised studies with comparison group (n = 4), and non-randomised studies without a comparison group (n = 3). Interventions were delivered digitally, in person or a combination of the two. The risk of bias was high in over half the studies (n = 7). The main findings of the studies showed some potential for both in person and digital interventions to increase parental health literacy. Studies were heterogeneous preventing a meta-analysis.Conclusion:Community-based, health literacy interventions have been identified as potential methods for enhancing parental health literacy. Due to the small number of included studies and their potential for bias, these results must be interpreted with caution. This study emphasises the need for additional theory and evidence-based research on the long-term effects of community interventions.","AI","University of Winchester"

To advance the evidence base for non-pharmacological and non-surgical stroke secondary prevention (SSP), empirical research is needed, informed by a consensus-derived definition of SSP. To date, no such definition has been published. We used Delphi methods to generate an evidence-based definition of non-pharmacological and non-surgical SSP.ResultsThe 16 participants were members of INSsPiRE (International Network of Stroke Secondary Prevention Researchers), a multidisciplinary group of trialists, academics and clinicians. The Elicitation stage identified 49 key elements, grouped into 3 overarching domains: Risk factors, Education, and Theory before being subjected to iterative stages of elicitation, ranking, discussion, and anonymous voting. In the Action stage, following an experience-based engagement with key stakeholders, a consensus-derived definition, complementing current pharmacological and surgical SSP pathways, was finalised: Non-pharmacological and non-surgical stroke secondary prevention supports and improves long-term health and well-being in everyday life and reduces the risk of another stroke, by drawing from a spectrum of theoretically informed interventions and educational strategies. Interventions to self-manage modifiable lifestyle risk factors are contextualized and individualized to the capacities, needs, and personally meaningful priorities of individuals with stroke and their families.","AI","University of Winchester"

It has generated many well-evidenced frameworks and many frameworks or approaches to leadership that have become global brands (sometimes without accompanying research). The subjects of school leadership and Christian leadership have, in recent decades, also generated a considerable amount of research. Christian leadership in schools has also begun to attract interest.In terms of defining Christian leadership in schools, we found no single authoritative definition. A preliminary analysis of Christian leadership in schools reveals a fragmented and diverse emerging field with very many perspectives. Perhaps because of the inevitable tensions between Biblical and secular demands, any consideration of Christian leadership in schools raises more fundamental questions than either the topic of leadership in the abstract, or leadership in schools where success is typically largely defined in terms of student achievement, can answer. We offer a typology (Figure 1, page 9) by which the many issues raised in the literature can begin to be examined.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy for children with acute osteomyelitis or septic arthritis: a feasibility study.","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/duration-of-intravenous-antibiotic-therapy-for-children-with-acut-3","Lees, A.;  & 7 others","1 Sep 2017","Background: There is little current consensus regarding the route or duration of antibiotic treatment for acute osteomyelitis (OM) and septic arthritis (SA) in children. Objective: To assess the overall feasibility and inform the design of a future randomised controlled trial (RCT) to reduce the duration of intravenous antibiotic use in paediatric OM and SA. Design:  a): Prospective service evaluation (cohort study) to determine the current disease spectrum and UK clinical practice in paediatric OM/SA; b) prospective cohort sub-study to assess the use of targeted PCR in diagnosing paediatric OM/SA: study;  c) a qualitative study explored families views and experiences of OM/SA; and  d)development of a core outcome set via systematic review of literature, Delphi clinician survey and stakeholder consensus meeting. Setting: 44 UK secondary and tertiary UK centres (service evaluation). Participants: Children with OM/SA Results: Data was obtained on 313 cases of OM/SA of which 218 (61.2%) were defined as simple disease and 95 (26.7%) complex. The epidemiology of paediatric OM/SA in this study was consistent with existing European data. Children who met oral switch criteria less than 7 days from starting intravenous antibiotics had less treatment failure (9.6%) than children who meet oral switch criteria after 7 days of intravenous therapy (16.1% where switch was between 1-2 weeks, 18.2% switch >2 weeks). In 24 of 32 simple cases (75%) and 8 of 12 complex cases (67%) in whom the targeted PCR was used a pathogen was detected. The qualitative study demonstrated the importance to parents and children of consideration of short and long term outcomes meaningful to families themselves. The consensus meeting agreed on the following outcomes: re-hospitalisation or recurrence of symptoms while on oral antibiotics, recurrence of infection, disability at follow-up,symptom free at 1 year, limb shortening or deformity, chronic osteomyelitis or arthritis,amputation or fasciotomy, death, need for paediatric intensive care and line infection. Oral switch criteria were identified, including resolution of fever for 48 hours or more, tolerating oral food and medicines, and pain improvement. Page 6 of 422 Limitations: Data were collected in a 6 month period which might not have been representative and follow up data for long term complications are limited. Conclusions: A future RCT would need to recruit from all tertiary and most secondary UK hospitals. Clinicians have implemented early oral switch for selected patients with simple disease without formal clinical trial evidence of safety. However, the current criteria by which decisions to make the oral switch are made are not clearly established or evidence based. Future work: An RCT in simple OM and SA comparing shorter or longer course IV therapy is feasible in children randomised after oral switch criteria are met after 7 days of intravenous therapy, excluding children meeting oral switch criteria in the first week of intravenous therapy. This study design meets clinician preferences and addresses parental concerns not to randomise prior to oral switch criteria being met.","AI","University of Winchester"
"A ‘satisfied settling’?

This paper presents the findings of a research study conducted at a small-medium sized University in the UK to explore Muslim students' sense of belonging at the Institution, aiming to assess whether the University of Winchester followed a western trend of housing barriers to a full HE experience for minority student groups (Harper & Quaye, 2015). As the student population in the UK is growing to 50% of 18-24-year-old adults, so too is the number of students from diverse and underrepresented groups such as: students of faith, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students, disabled students and students with caring responsibilities (Lea, 2015). Therefore, understanding Winchester's Muslim student populations' sense of belonging and engagement at the Institution was to be deemed necessary. This study spanned over Winter 2017 / Spring 2018 using semi-structured interviews with 20% of the Muslim student population at the University, with findings suggesting that although the HEI has a very small Muslim population, students generally felt valued and a sense of belonging to the Institution. However, this was seen to be one-sided (fuelled mostly by positive academic experiences) and was implicated by being of minority status, to which the article labels as a ‘satisfied settling’. The article will also discuss how simple implementations by HEIs can further engage and enhance the university experience for these students.","AI","University of Winchester"

During the national lockdowns, when it was not possible for most children to physically attend school, the efficacy and efficiency of digital platforms made it possible for schools to fulfil their duties to provide an education. However, the urgency of the situation carried the risk that this was put in place without adequate consideration of the data protection risks from various online learning tools. Although the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a framework of regulations and rights to protect users, the legal process is unwieldy to apply due to tensions in balancing the rights of the child learner with the public need to ensure that all children are provided with an education. This paper recommends that changes in digital schooling practices are needed so that children have realistically possible ways of enforcing their data protection rights as well as a clarified and uniformed approach to support schools.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Algorithmic Risk Assessment Policing Models: Lessons from the Durham HART Model and ‘Experimental’ Proportionality","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/algorithmic-risk-assessment-policing-models-lessons-from-the-durh-3","","3 Apr 2018","As is common across the public sector, the UK police service is under pressure to do more with less, to target resources more efficiently and take steps to identify threats proactively; for example under risk-assessment schemes such as ‘Clare’s Law’ and ‘Sarah’s Law’. Algorithmic tools promise to improve a police force’s decision-making and prediction abilities by making better use of data (including intelligence), both from inside and outside the force.  This article uses Durham Constabulary’s Harm Assessment Risk Tool (HART) as a case-study. HART is one of the first algorithmic models to be deployed by a UK police force in an operational capacity. Our article comments upon the potential benefits of such tools, explains the concept and method of HART and considers the results of the first validation of the model’s use and accuracy.  The article then critiques the use of algorithmic tools within policing from a societal and legal perspective, focusing in particular upon substantive common law grounds for judicial review. It considers a concept of ‘experimental’ proportionality to permit the use of unproven algorithms in the public sector in a controlled and time-limited way, and as part of a combination of approaches to combat algorithmic opacity, proposes ‘ALGO-CARE’, a guidance framework of some of the key legal and practical concerns that should be considered in relation to the use of algorithmic risk assessment tools by the police. The article concludes that for the use of algorithmic tools in a policing context to result in a ‘better’ outcome, that is to say, a more efficient use of police resources in a landscape of more consistent, evidence-based decision-making, then an ‘experimental’ proportionality approach should be developed to ensure that new solutions from ‘big data’ can be found for criminal justice problems traditionally arising from clouded, non-augmented decision-making. Finally, this article notes that there is a sub-set of decisions around which there is too great an impact upon society and upon the welfare of individuals for them to be influenced by an emerging technology; to an extent, in fact, that they should be removed from the influence of algorithmic decision-making altogether.","AI","University of Winchester"

In Japan, the transport sector accounts for almost 20 per cent of carbon emissions. At the same time, a population decrease has led to a decline in use of public transport, reducing the level of the quality of life of residents who live in rural and remote areas. This makes residents depend on private cars, ending up contributing to carbon emissions. Three key issues for sustainable mobility to tackle carbon emissions and residents’ wellbeing issues are discussed. Kashiwa City has experimented with new shared transport services with fixed-route microbuses and more flexible community taxis. The paper explores user perception and experience of such community mobility services and considers the three issues from the viewpoint of the practice of mobility. Background interviews were conducted with the city’s officials and transport service operators, and an ethnographic study was carried out and in-situ conversations were made to explore the utility and meaning of mobility. To increase use of public transport to further reduce CO2 emissions from transport, it is important to pay more attention to the practice of mobility from the user’s perspective.

This review discusses the ethical and acceptability challenges resulting in low adoption of health technologies specifically focused on smart homes for older adults. The findings have been structured in two categories: Ethical Considerations (Privacy, Social Support, and Autonomy) and Technology Aspects (User Context, Usability, and Training). The findings conclude that older adults community is more likely to adopt assistive systems when four key criteria are met. The technology should: be personalized toward their needs, protect their dignity and independence, provide user control, and not be isolating. Finally, we recommend researchers and developers working on assistive systems to: (1) provide interfaces via smart devices to control and configure the monitoring system with feedback for the user, (2) include various sensors/devices to architect a smart home solution in a way that is easy to integrate in daily life, and (3) define policies about data ownership.","AI","University of Winchester"

Within this small corpus, particular attention will be given to two documentary programmes broadcast by Italian State-owned network RAI in 1965. The documentaries Europa per la libertà (Europe for Liberty) and Il giorno della pace (The Day of Peace) represent some of Italian television’s earliest forms of engagement with the issue of how to remember the Holocaust. Moreover, these discussions of Holocaust memory were framed in terms in which national and transnational dimensions coexisted. However, this emphasis on supranational memory was not at odds with domestic needs, as it was ultimately consistent with established Italian national narratives about the war and the country’s role in it.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Genetic and phenotypic differentiation of an Andean intermediate altitude population.","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/genetic-and-phenotypic-differentiation-of-an-andean-intermediate--3","","6 May 2015","Highland populations living permanently under hypobaric hypoxia have been subject of extensive research because of the relevance of their physiological adaptations for the understanding of human health and disease. In this context, what is considered high altitude is a matter of interpretation and while the adaptive processes at high altitude (above 3000 m) are well documented, the effects of moderate altitude (below 3000 m) on the phenotype are less well established. In this study, we compare physiological and anthropometric characteristics as well as genetic variations in two Andean populations: the Calchaquíes (2300 m) and neighboring Collas (3500 m). We compare their phenotype and genotype to the sea‐level Wichí population. We measured physiological (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, and lung function) as well as anthropometric traits (height, sitting height, weight, forearm, and tibia length). We conducted genome‐wide genotyping on a subset of the sample (n = 74) and performed various scans for positive selection. At the phenotypic level (n = 179), increased lung capacity stood out in both Andean groups, whereas a growth reduction in distal limbs was only observed at high altitude. At the genome level, Calchaquíes revealed strong signals around PRKG1, suggesting that the nitric oxide pathway may be a target of selection. PRKG1 was highlighted by one of four selection tests among the top five genes using the population branch statistic. Selection tests results of Collas were reported previously. Overall, our study shows that some phenotypic and genetic differentiation occurs at intermediate altitude in response to moderate lifelong selection pressures.","AI","University of Winchester"

It is thus important to measure quality of life (QoL) in these patients by evaluating issues relevant and important to them, as opposed to general cancer issues. This paper systematically reviews papers addressing the symptoms and QoL implications of pNETs, and evaluates each subtype separately, with the aim to create a list of QoL issues relevant to these patient groups. Methods Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus, OpenGrey and the Cochrane Library were searched for publications (1990‐2016) reporting symptoms and QoL issues in pNETs. Results Following screening of 2797 papers, 69 articles were eligible for data extraction. From these papers, 84 different symptoms or QoL issues were extracted: 21 for gastrinoma, 18 for glucagonoma, 50 for insulinoma, 10 for VIPoma and 15 for non‐functioning pNETs. No issues were reported for somatostatinoma, PPoma or ACTHoma. The most frequently reported symptoms vary by subtype. Conclusions This review emphasises the need to develop a QoL measure for pNETs with specific items relevant to the different subtypes, due to the distinct symptoms reported. Following from this review, patient and healthcare professional interviews will be conducted in large cohorts across many different countries to collect more data on QoL issues specific to pNETs. This data will all be collated with the aim to create a QoL measure for pNETs.","AI","University of Winchester"

The first vignette focuses on a strange conjunction at the turn of the millennium between two museum projects, one of them at least obliquely Holocaust-related, both forced to negotiate across fraught trans-communal cultural divides and to relate difficult parallel, convergent and divergent histories. The second picks out an instant, a transient flash point from the rolling news media of summer 2016, at which the sites, values and language of Holocaust memory were used to confront, in awkward but powerful ways,immediately contemporary anxieties and atrocities. Following these, the Introduction will move on to address the larger field of intersection between the terms, usages and scholarship of the Holocaust and genocide, including its often problematic aspects.

Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the data center industry, this essay approaches the visual form of the depopulated data center through the analytic of ‘wilderness’. Often connoting a domain of ‘pure nature’ uncorrupted by human presence, the concept of wilderness productively resonates with the representational strategies of the data center industry, where the visual elimination of human workers optically configures the data center as a posthuman ‘pure machine’. Through the experimental juxtaposition of ‘natural’ and ‘technological’ wildernesses, this essay explores how the infrastructure fiction of the depopulated data center intersects with fantasies and futures of technological progress, nonhuman security, automation and data objectivity.","AI","University of Winchester"

This paper builds on the concept of structural relation patterns and applies the Concurrent Sequential Patterns (ConSP) mining approach to biological databases. Specifically, an original method is presented using support vectors as the data structure for the extraction of novel patterns in protein sequences. Data modelling is pursued to represent the more interesting concurrent patterns visually. Experiments with real-world protein datasets from the UniProt and NCBI databases highlight the applicability of the ConSP methodology in protein data mining and modelling. The results show the potential for knowledge discovery in the field of protein structure identification.

The model was calibrated and validated using the hourly observed discharges from two gauges located in the outlet of the catchment (62.34 km               2) and in the inner sub-catchment (2.05 km               2). Precipitation from four gauges was spatially interpolated over the overall catchment, while the sub-catchment used the precipitation from one gauge. Four scenarios of different lengths of deletion within three high-intensity events were established in the data of this gauge. Three infilling methods were applied and compared: substitution, linear regression and inverse distance weighting (IDW). Substitution showed the best results, followed by linear regression and IDW in both scales. Differences between methods were significant only in 8.3% and 19.4% of all cases (sub-catchment and catchment, respectively). The impact of length was assessed using the substitution only and by comparing differences in discharges and performance statistics caused by four scenarios. Higher differences in discharges were found on the catchment scale compared to the inner sub-catchment and were insignificant for all events and scenarios. The hypothesis that a longer length of deleted and filled data would lead to a greater error in discharges was wrong for 11.1% and 16.7% of all cases (sub-catchment and catchment, respectively). In several cases (33.4% sub-catchment, 27.1% catchment), the model produced better results using the time series with filled gaps compared to the configuration with observed data.

Nevertheless, the availability of high-resolution genomic data has led to the development of new methodologies for inferring population history7–9 and refuelled the debate on the mutation rate in humans10. Here we present the Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset of 483 high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including 379 new genomes from 125 populations, which we group into diversity and selection sets. We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of continent-wide patterns of heterozygosity, long- and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes in effective population size through time as well as for signals of positive or balancing selection. We find a genetic signature in present-day Papuans that suggests that at least 2% of their genome originates from an early and largely extinct expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) out of Africa. Together with evidence from the western Asian fossil record11, and admixture between AMHs and Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion12, our results contribute to the mounting evidence for the presence of AMHs out of Africa earlier than 75,000 years ago.","AI","University of Winchester"
"When the bishop’s away... : Absentee bishops of Parma during the investiture conflict","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/when-the-bishops-away-absentee-bishops-of-parma-during-the-invest-3","Houghton, R.","Nov 2017","Between 1050 and 1130 the bishops of Parma were frequently absent from the city. The bishops Cadalus (1045-1072), Eberard (1072-1085) and Vido (1085-1104) all appeared in imperial armies for extended periods. Bishop Bernard (1104-1133) was expelled by groups within the city for several years. This paper will investigate the relationship between these absences and changes in the structures of power and authority within the city and county of Parma.  The bishops of Parma were some of the most powerful ecclesiastical figures in Italy under the Ottonian and early Salian emperors. They enjoyed a large territory and a series of rights and exemptions allowing them to act decisively within the region; a key example of this was the prolonged attempt by Cadalus, bishop of Parma, to claim the papal seat as Honorious II in 1061-1072. However, towards the end of the eleventh century the bishops of Parma featured less prominently in the ongoing papal-imperial conflict. By the middle of the twelfth century they had been largely replaced by the commune of Parma as the dominant force in the city. Authors such as Schumann, Fasoli and Santifaller have seen this change in the political structure of Parma as the result of the imposition of Gregorian and Paterene ideals on the bishopric which called for the reduction or elimination of the secular roles of the bishop. However, the extended absences of the bishops from the city have not been considered in this context in any real depth. By considering the political, judicial and economic infrastructures employed during these absences I will attempt to establish whether a causal or consequential link can be made to the bishops’ diminishing secular role.","AI","University of Winchester"

The sites’ occupants primarily acquired lithic material from this obsidian source, which is manifested throughout the local landscape, but its obsidian exposures, produced during a single eruptive phase, exhibit the same geochemical signature. This situation inspired the development of rock magnetic characterization as a means to recognize obsidian from different spots across the volcanic complex (i.e., intra-source, not inter-source, characterization). This intra-source approach was first applied to the Middle Palaeolithic site of Lusakert Cave 1, where the data revealed that the occupants collected obsidian throughout the river valley, rather than a preferred outcrop, quarrying area, or secondary deposit. Such a finding implied that the toolstone procurement spatially coincided with the valley and was embedded in subsistence activities. In this new study, the same approach to intra-source magnetic characterization is applied to the Lower Palaeolithic site of Nor Geghi 1 – specifically, to obsidian debris dated between 440 and 335 millennia ago. The magnetic measurements show that, like at Lusakert Cave 1, toolstone acquisition occurred within the valley. If, as we propose, obsidian procurement reflects the spatial distribution of subsistence activities, it attests that archaic hominins at both sites and in both periods were able to effectively exploit a resource-rich riparian ecosystem.

"Expanding the role of the future zoo: Wellbeing should become the fifth aim for modern zoos","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/expanding-the-role-of-the-future-zoo-wellbeing-should-become-the-","Riley, L.","20 Oct 2022","Zoos and aquariums have an enormous global reach and hence an ability to craft meaningful conservation action for threatened species, implement educational strategies to encourage human engagement, development and behavior change, and conduct scientific research to enhance the husbandry, roles and impacts of the living collection. The recreational role of the zoo is also vast- people enjoy visiting the zoo and this is often a shared experience amongst family and friends. Evaluating how the zoo influences this “captive audience” and extending its reach to include a compassionate approach to animals and people can further enhance the mission, value, and relevance of their work. The modern zoo’s current aims—Conservation, Education, Research and Recreation—provide useful foundations for the activities that zoos conduct at a local and national level. However, to improve sustainability of their actions and outcomes, we feel that Wellbeing should become the fifth aim of the modern zoo for the future- both from an animal perspective (ensuring that populations are managed according to prevailing behavioral needs) and from a human perspective (enhancing access to nature, promoting planetary friendly behavior changes and ways of living, and advancing the wellbeing of the zoo’s workforce). This paper provides discussion and review of how Wellbeing is already a substantial part of what zoos work on as well as posing the idea of altering the Recreation aim of the zoo to one of Engagement, which potentially is more measurable and therefore can allow zoo researchers and managers further options for the collection of evidence on the local and global reach of their zoo’s aims. Education, Engagement, Conservation, Research and Wellbeing provide a more complete picture of the roles of the modern zoo for the animals (both in situ and ex situ), human visitors and workforce, and to society more widely.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Algorithm-assisted decision-making in the public sector: framing the issues using administrative law rules governing discretionary power","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/algorithm-assisted-decision-making-in-the-public-sector-framing-t","","13 Sep 2018","This article considers some of the risks and challenges raised by the use of algorithm-assisted decision-making and predictive tools by the public sector. Alongside, it reviews a number of long-standing English administrative law rules designed to regulate the discretionary power of the state. The principles of administrative law are concerned with human decisions involved in the exercise of state power and discretion, thus offering a promising avenue for the regulation of the growing number of algorithm-assisted decisions within the public sector. This article attempts to re-frame key rules for the new algorithmic environment and argues that 'old' law-interpreted for a new context-can help guide lawyers, scientists and public sector practitioners alike when considering the development and deployment of new algorithmic tools.

"Approaching ancient disease from a One Health perspective: Interdisciplinary review for the investigation of zoonotic brucellosis","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/approaching-ancient-disease-from-a-one-health-perspective-interdi","Oakes, R.","12 Nov 2019","Today, brucellosis is the most common global bacterial zoonosis, bringing with it a range of significant health and economic consequences, yet it is rarely identified from the archaeological record. Detection and understanding of past zoonoses could be improved by triangulating evidence and proxies generated through different approaches. The complex socioecological systems that support zoonoses involve humans, animals, and pathogens interacting within specific environmental and cultural contexts, and as such, there is a diversity of potential datasets that can be targeted. To capture this, in this paper, we consider how to approach the study of zoonotic brucellosis in the past from a One Health perspective, one which explicitly acknowledges the health link between people, animals, and environments (both physical and cultural). One Health research is explicitly interdisciplinary and conceptually moves away from an anthropocentric approach, allowing the component parts to be considered in holistic and integrated ways to deliver more comprehensive understanding. To this end, in this paper, we review the methods, selected evidence, and potential for past brucellosis identification and understanding, focussing on osteological markers in humans and animals, historical, biomolecular, and epidemiological approaches. We also present an agenda and potential for future research.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Towards a deeper understanding of Meaningful Use in Electronic Health Records","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/towards-a-deeper-understanding-of-meaningful-use-in-electronic-he","","28 Sep 2018","Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify and analyse the US Health Sector concept of the ‘Meaningful Use’ of electronic health records (EHR's) based on the wide diversity of discourses in the published literature. Meaningful Use is defined as ‘use of digital medical and health records to improve quality, safety and efficiency of patient health information’. Methods: Herman Dooyeweerd's philosophical suite of aspects was the chosen research tool used to analyse seminal papers concerning the Meaningful Use of EHRs. The methodology included the identification of the criteria for choosing the papers: application of the criteria to the literature and then selection of the papers and finally the application of Dooyeweerd's aspects to the papers in order to analyse and classify the motivations of the authors. Results: As a result of the aspectual analysis of the relevant texts in the seminal papers, two aspects were identified, one as primary and another one as secondary. In addition, the analytic aspect was repeated twice as the primary aspect. Although there were a number of papers distinctively centred on different aspects, overlaps and similarities were also clearly identified. Discussion: Dooyeweerd's philosophy is useful in helping to affirm the factors that are important to the authors of the seminal papers and the philosophy helps us to accommodate this diversity in a unique way, therefore enhancing our understanding of approaches in the area. Conclusion: By employing the lens of Dooyeweerd's aspects, the study enhances the understanding of diversity in one discipline and could potentially provide a new system for the classification of diversity within other related disciplines.","AI","University of Winchester"

Modern historiography has almost universally argued that Boniface gained his power through a close relationship and alliance with a series of German emperors. Most accounts see Boniface’s fall and eventual murder in 1052 as a direct consequence of the breakdown of this relationship. 	This analysis is flawed, however, as it rests predominantly on the evidence of a single source: the Vita Mathildis by Donizone of Canossa. This document was produced more than half a century after the death of Boniface by an author who held complex political goals, but these have not been fully considered in the discussion of Boniface. Through the examination of the charter sources, this article argues that Donizone misrepresented Boniface’s actions and that there is considerable evidence that Boniface was not a consistent ally of the German emperors.","AI","University of Winchester"

N.","1 Jan 2000","The coastal plain of West Sussex, southern England, is internationally important because of the sequence of discrete high-sea-level events preserved at various elevations across it. New evidence is presented from a site at Norton Farm, near Chichester, on the Lower Coastal Plain, where Pleistocene marine sands, fining upwards into silts, occur between 5.3 m and 9.1 m OD. The sequence reflects a regressive tendency at the transition from an interglacial to a cold stage. The marine sands have yielded foraminifera, ostracods and molluscs that indicate a declining marine influence through the sequence, culminating in a tidal mudflat, strongly weathered in places. Cool-climate foraminifera (including Elphidium clavatum, Cassidulina reniformis and Elphidium albiumbilicatum) and ostracods have been recovered from the marine sands. Some species with an apparent preference for warmer water conditions, however, are also present. Freshwater taxa washed into the terminal marine sediments include some cold climate indicators, such as Pisidium stewarti and P. obtusale lapponicum. Additional evidence for cool climatic conditions during the deposition of the upper part of the marine sequence is provided by the lack of tree taxa in the pollen record and by features of the micromorphology. The marine sediments probably began accumulating during OIS 7, a conclusion based on their elevation, on amino acid ratios from shells, but especially on vertebrate evidence, particularly the presence of a small form of horse, together with a large, distinctive, form of northern vole (Microtus oeconomus). The occurrence of cool climate indicators in these marine sediments may demonstrate a lag between the climatic deterioration and the expected glacio-eustatic fall in relative sea-level. This evidence appears to support the conclusions drawn from the study of coral terraces in Barbados. Such a scenario would provide the conditions necessary for the emplacement of the large erratic boulders reported from the Lower Coastal Plain of West Sussex.

A Straussian grounded theory methodology was used. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with athletes (n = 22) and coaches (n = 15). Data were analysed through a process of open and axial coding, and theoretical integration. Through the process of analysis, data were broken down into smaller units (concepts), relationships between concepts were identified, and a substantive grounded theory was developed. The grounded theory of inspirational coach-leadership was built around the core category of ‘athlete(s) inspired through changed awareness of their capabilities.’ The core category was underpinned by three categories: (a) Establishment of mutual trust and respect with athletes, whereby coaches need to establish trust with athletes in order to inspire athletes; (b) conditions under which inspiration has the potential to occur, which highlighted that athletes are inspired in situations where they are vulnerable or ignorant regarding their potential; and (c) coach acts to change athlete’s awareness of their capabilities, which denotes the specific behaviours coaches should display to inspire athletes in such conditions. The theory also highlights that a range of contextual factors relating to the coach, athletes, and performance-environment interact to impact upon the process. The theory predicts that consistency between coach behaviour and the conditions in which inspiration can occur will lead to athlete-inspiration, but only if the coach has established a foundation of trust and respect with the athlete.

"The digital traveller: implications for data ethics and data governance in tourism and hospitality","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/the-digital-traveller-implications-for-data-ethics-and-data-gover","","3 Sep 2021","Purpose – Big data and analytics are being increasingly used by tourism and hospitality organisations (THOs) to provide insights and to inform critical business decisions. Particularly in times of crisis and uncertainty data analytics supports THOs to acquire the knowledge needed to ensure business continuity and the rebuild of tourism and hospitality sectors. Despite being recognised as an important source of value creation, big data and digital technologies raise ethical, privacy and security concerns. This paper aims to suggest a framework for ethical data management in tourism and hospitality designed to facilitate and promote effective data governance practices.Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts an organisational and stakeholder perspective through a scoping review of the literature to provide an overview of an under-researched topic and to guide further research in data ethics and data governance.Findings – The proposed framework integrates an ethical-based approach which expands beyond mere compliance with privacy and protection laws, to include other critical facets regarding privacy and ethics, an equitable exchange of travellers’ data and THOs ability to demonstrate a social license to operate by building trusting relationships with stakeholders.Originality/value – This study represents one of the first studies to consider the development of an ethical data framework for THOs, as a platform for further refinements in future conceptual and empirical research of such data governance frameworks. It contributes to the advancement of the body of knowledge in data ethics and data governance in tourism and hospitality and other industries and it is also beneficial to practitioners, asorganisations may use it as a guide in data governance practices.","AI","University of Winchester"

V.","22 Apr 2020","Barozh 12 is a Middle Paleolithic (MP) open-air site located near the Mt Arteni volcanic complex at the margins of the Ararat Depression, an intermontane basin that contains the Araxes River. Sedimentology, micromorphology, geochronology, biomarker evidence, together with an assessment of artifact taphonomy permits the modelling of site formation processes and paleoenvironment at a level of detail not previously achieved in this area. Obsidian MP artifacts were recovered in high densities at Barozh 12 from four stratigraphic units deposited during marine oxygen isotope stage 3 (MIS 3) (60.2 ± 5.7–31.3 ± 3 ka). The MIS 3 sequence commences with low energy alluvial deposits that have been altered by incipient soil formation, while artifact assemblages in these strata were only minimally reworked. After a depositional hiatus, further low energy alluvial sedimentation and weak soil formation occurred, followed by higher energy colluvial (re)deposition and then deflation. Artifacts in these last stratigraphic units were more significantly reworked than those below. Analysis of plant leaf wax (n-alkane) biomarkers shows fluctuating humidity throughout the sequence. Collectively the evidence suggests that hunter-gatherers equipped with MP lithic technology repeatedly occupied this site during variable aridity regimes, demonstrating their successful adaptation to the changing environments of MIS 3.","AI","University of Winchester"
"A Preliminary Structural Analysis Of The Upper Airways Of Healthy And Moderate Persistent Asthmatic Patients","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/a-preliminary-structural-analysis-of-the-upper-airways-of-healthy","Collier, L.","May 2012","INTRODUCTION Three-dimensional reconstructions of the human lung based on medical imaging modalities such as High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) are frequently used to generate anatomical models of the lung1,2,3. However, even though an important purpose of this line of research is the prediction of gas flow and aerosol deposition4,5 in diseased lungs, not much has been published on the description of airway-tree geometric remodelling due to disease3,6. This study is a preliminary report on the 3D-reconstruction of the morphology and topology of the upper airways of 7 healthy and 6 moderate asthmatic adult patients. METHODS Healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients in stable state participating in a clinical study (EudraCT #2007-003563-43) underwent an HRCT scan, producing datasets with 512x512 slice resolution and 0.75mm slice thickness. The software used for the image reconstruction and analysis is Pulmonary Workstation 2 (VIDA Diagnostics, Iowa) and Matlab v7.10. RESULTS Figure 1 is an illustration of the inter-subject variability inherent of the human lung and, more specifically, of the Right Upper Lobe (RUL). A difference in relative connectivity can easily be observed between the sub-lobar bronchi RB1, RB2 and RB3, with the existence (or not) of a relatively small intermediate airway between them. Such variability appears to be characteristic in many locations of the upper airway tree. Figure 2 displays a clinically uncharacteristic stenosis in 2 and 3D. It is unclear at this point whether the stenosis is permanently remodelled or a temporary mucous-plug due to inflammation. The number of generation-5 identifiable and segmentable airways is 77.7% for healthy and 55.2% for asthmatics, while for generation-6 this becomes 21.4% and 10.4% respectively. CONCLUSIONS The presence of intermediate airways in trifurcating or semi-trifurcating structures makes the classification of lung morphology by anatomical generation problematic. Therefore, instead of the usual Weibel7 airway classification system, either the Horsfield Order8 or a new airway-generation definition needs to be used. Furthermore, the analysis of the 3D image reconstructions seems to suggest variability in the number of sub-lobar spaces, as opposed to the 10 considered to form each lung by most anatomical atlases. In addition, even though great progress has been realized in the creation of algorithms for automatic airway recognition, the segmentation and measurement of the airway tree still requires significant user intervention. Finally, a measure of the reduced airway lumen in asthmatic patients is given by the decreased number of bronchi of generation-6 that can be delineated.

Although the site was tested in the 1980s, little has been published regarding the material. Consequently, we reinvestigated the site by expanding the original test pit to better understand the stratigraphy and recover a new sample of artifacts. As a result, more than 300 obsidian artifacts were recovered from colluvial deposits found close to primary obsidian outcrops, which sourcing data show to be the exclusive areas of toolstone procurement used by the inhabitants. The recovered assemblages are Late Acheulian in character and are largely homogenous across strata in terms of techno-typology. Hatis-1 records the use of large flakes for production of cores and tools indicative of the Large Flake Acheulian, but also contains limited evidence for simple prepared cores and the recycling of bifaces as cores, suggesting expansion of the technological repertoire of hominins in this region during the Late Acheulian. The in-depth study of large cutting tools presented here reveals that differences in the shape and typology of these tools are largely determined by different production strategies. While samples suitable for direct chronometric dates were not recovered, constraining geological factors suggest this material was deposited after c.700/480 ka. This study expands our understanding of the Late Acheulian and further contextualizes the later Lower–Middle Paleolithic technological transition in the region. In a broader sense, our interpretation of the techno-typological patterns at Hatis-1 expands the current understanding of geographical and chronological variation in the Acheulian record.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Creative Leadership to Develop Creativity and Creative Thinking in English Schools: A review of the evidence","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/creative-leadership-to-develop-creativity-and-creative-thinking-i","Lucas, B.; Spencer, E.","18 Nov 2021","This review forms the initial foundation for a piece of work commissioned by the Mercers’ Company designed to help school leaders in secondary schools in England make creativity central to their students’ lives. Across the world the importance of creativity is increasingly acknowledged in education systems. But though leadership in schools is well-researched in general terms, leadership for creativity is not. In this review, we chart the establishment of a robust definition of creative leadership in schools, summarise the case for its importance today, and illustrate what it looks like in secondary schools. The review builds on the first report of the Durham Commission on Creativity and Education in 2019 and research by the OECD published in the same year by analysing the opportunities and challenges that secondary school leaders face if they truly wish to focus on developing the creativity of their students. From our reading of the literature, both scholarly and ‘grey’ sources, ‘creative leadership’ is the term we believe best encapsulates a kind of school leadership that explicitly develops the creativity of all of its members, staff and students alike. The concept of creative leadership and research relating to it is underdeveloped in education, while in other fields there is more consensus. Our understanding of ‘creative leadership’ in its broadest sense suggests that it is a helpful way of capturing the essence of school leaders’ role, and a starting point for considering how the sorts of challenges identified by the Durham Commission might best be met. Our review of the literature suggests that we need to reimagine the kind of leadership that will develop creative students (and creative staff) at a theoretical level, as well as clarifying the practical implications for leaders’ practices. Creative leadership will explicitly seek to cultivate creative habits inteaching staff who can, in turn, model these with their students. Creative leaders ensure that there are multiple opportunities for developing the creativity of all young people while at the same time recognising that for a school truly to be a creative organisation then developing the creativity of its leaders and staff is important both as a means to an end and as an end in itself.Leading for creativity is likely to mean setting an agenda for change that involves prioritising practices that develop creative leaders through collaboration within and across professional communities, that promote the development of creative cultures and structures and that utilise creative pedagogies. Creative leadership is a concept whose successful application in schools could benefit from the development of a range of professional learning resources for senior leaders in schools. This review aims to provide a basis for the development of a leadership toolkit that can be trialled for further development with leaders in English secondary schools, used to support a new professional learning community and, potentially, adapted for school leaders across the world.","AI","University of Winchester"

METHODS: Twenty-two acute stroke patients (72 ± 10y) had blood pressure measured using the SphygmoCor XCEL in supine and seated postures and whilst fasted and non-fasted. RESULTS: Acceptable short-term reproducibility (ICC >0.75) was reported for all peripheral and central variables in all conditions (ICC = 0.77–0.90) and for AIx and AIx75 in both fasted postures (ICC = 0.78–0.81). Food consumption significantly lowered all blood pressures (p <0.05; η2p = 0.20–0.55). The seated posture resulted in a significantly greater AIx than supine (p <0.05; η2p = 0.22). Fasting state had significant main effects on AIx and AIx75 (p <0.05; η2p = 0.14–0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Oscillometric estimates of central blood pressure have high short-term reproducibility in different postures and fasting states but markers of systolic load should be assessed whilst fasted. Fasting state has a large effect on central and peripheral blood pressures and on measures of systolic loading. It is important for clinicians to be aware of optimal assessment conditions without this impacting on patient wellbeing.","AI","University of Winchester"

This study examined the between-day reliability of the SphygmoCor XCEL in individuals over 50 years. As blood pressure is measured in a range of postures and fasting states (supine/seated, fasted/non-fasted), this study also investigated the effect of these variables on central blood pressure and central systolic loading. Methods: Fifty-one adults (m=21; age 57 ± 6.4 y) were tested on three mornings in supine and seated conditions and in fasted and non-fasted states. Data was analysed as a whole and for normotensive (n=25) and hypertensive participants (n=26). Results: SphygmoCor XCEL demonstrated strong reliability in the whole sample for central systolic and diastolic blood pressures, augmentation index (AIx) and AIx75 (ICC=0.77–0.95). Significant interaction effects were observed in central diastolic blood pressure, central pulse pressure, augmentation index (AIx) and AIx75 (p < 0.05;  = 0.10-0.23). Fasting state had a greater influence on central pressures in a seated than supine posture, but a greater effect on central systolic loading measures in a supine posture. Conclusions: The SphygmoCor XCEL is a reliable tool to assess central haemodynamic variables in an older population. It would be pertinent for clinicians and researchers to record central measures in a supine posture to minimise the effects of food consumption. Conversely, the assessment of central systolic loading should occur in a seated condition to minimise the influence of varying fasting states.","AI","University of Winchester"

Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants’ experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was ‘life-giving’, in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term.","AI","University of Winchester"

Results: During RT at 10, 15 and 20% MVC, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for AIx@75 (0.76-0.9), cSBP (0.74-0.78), Pf (0.75-0.82) and Pb (0.75-0.83) exceeded the criteria (0.75) for excellent reliability. During 5 min recovery the ICC values for AIx@75 (0.87-0.87), cSBP (0.69-0.7), Pf (0.63-0.67) and Pb (0.63-0.66) indicated good to excellent reliability. Conclusions: Clinically meaningful changes in central hemodynamic indices can be obtained during resistance training using oscillometric PWA devices. This technology holds potential for advancing resistance training prescription guidelines for patients with overt cardiovascular diseases.","AI","University of Winchester"

It is a process based platform for artistic exchange and dialogue through the Arts. The Bow project is a cross cultural collaboration between artists from Asia and Europe who work in Dance, music and film.  The BOW Project was born out of our experiences in China and is about exchanging and renewing our ideas about movement from within our own and other cultures. The original project was motivated by notions of bowing; metaphorically, culturally and physically. Initially, each artist offered a ‘bow’ from their culture, perspective or experience which may take any form.  The Bow project aims are to:  1. Explore the physicality of the body in life and in arts practices  2. Develop methods for artists to effectively collaborate through a shared language of the body in forms, felt response, intuition & practical reasoning.  3. Share processes, experiences and products with the wider community in live performance, workshops, dialogue and through documentation  The BOW project series aims to facilitate a shared experience and understanding through art processes and forms, drawing from the thoughts and feelings that underpin them.  The aim is to grow through the ‘lived experience’ at the heart of the arts practice.","AI","University of Winchester"

However, cricket, as with a number of Australian sports, has recently introduced an elite women's league. Despite growth in participation and funding of women's cricket, it remains poorly understood at the elite level and particularly its fans. Drawing on the concept of gender-bland sexism (Musto et al., 2017), we investigate differences in fan engagement and perceptions of men's and women's cricket matches. Through a case study of Australian Women's Big Bash cricket team the ‘Sydney Sixers’, this chapter explores how women's cricket was experienced on match-day by fans, as well as perceptions of the value and quality of attending women's professional cricket. We first undertook participant observation at matches to understand how women's cricket was delivered, experienced and engaged with by fans. These observations informed a survey which was distributed to club members. Our findings suggest that there continue to be noticeable differences in the presentation of women's matches when compared to their male equivalents, providing evidence for the presence of gender-bland sexism in areas other than sports media.","AI","University of Winchester"

J.","5 Jan 2020","This paper presents the results from a study exploring coaching practices in European. The survey covered 50 European countries, was undertaken in 31 languages with approaching 2500 participants engaged in the coaching industry and involved a partnership of over 100 professional bodies, universities and networks, who helped to promote the online survey. This paper focuses on the results from the Baltic States including Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, where there has been little research into coaching practice despite the growth of coaching. It builds on other national published studies drawing on the same research. The results from this study show that coaching in Lithuania is broadly similar to wider European practice. Interesting differences include the limited use of supervision, the relatively low fee rates when compared with European averages and the importance placed on continuous professional development by Baltic coaches. In general, the data suggests that while coaching is growing, in scale and scope, it remains comparatively immature compared with some other European States when coaching has a twenty to thirty-year history of progress and development.

"Touch and the Socially Dead","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/touch-and-the-socially-dead","Welch, C.","2023","The premise of this short chapter revolves around St. Francis (Francesco di Pietro di Bernardone c.1181/82 – 1226) touching a leper: that is to put it simply, St. Francis briefly and physically engaged with someone who had Hansen’s Disease.  The story’s central meaning is often taken to be that Francis treated the leper as a human being at a time when such individuals were generally deemed to be socially-dead (not part of normative society). Although Hansen’s Disease requires prolonged close physical contact to be contagious, it had long rendered the afflicted an effective outcast from everyday normative society due to fear of contagion by even the slightest contact. This was certainly the case in St. Francis’s time when sufferers were typically incarcerated in leprosaria and/or avoided.  Today, people who culturally could be deemed socially-dead would generally not include those suffering from Hansen’s Disease, but can include individuals confined to a residential or nursing home due to old-age and/or infirmity,  people incarcerated in prisons for crimes they have been found guilty of, enslaved people, long-term hospital patients,  and even severely disabled people and/or children in orphanages in parts of the world when these individuals are virtually abandoned. The socially-dead are individuals who are not physically dead but dead to wider society, unable to participate in everyday life in culturally-normative ways. There is of course socio-cultural and religious variability to whom can be classed socially-dead,  especially in regard to specific diseases. One highly contextual disease is the HIV/AIDS virus which at one time in England (largely the geographical context for this chapter), as elsewhere in the world, was not only a death sentence physically, but a sentence of social-death if the infected person was socially-outed. Thankfully, in the UK and much of the industrial world, this is no longer the case with medical advances meaning those with HIV/AIDS, now have, on the whole, a life-long illness rather than a life-limiting one.  HIV/Aids is important to this paper; a paper which explores the significance of touch in connection with the socially-dead in two English contexts. Firstly, it explores Princess Diana (d.1997), who on April 19th 1987 was photographed shaking hands with a HIV/AIDS patient in a hospital, without her wearing protective gloves, at a time of “rampant” prejudice against HIV/AIDS sufferers.  Secondly, it unpacks various issues surrounding the recent government mandated prohibition on touch in England for the socially-dead in hospitals and care-homes during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (circa March 2020-February 2022).

"The Messiness of Human Life in Technology for Education","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/the-messiness-of-human-life-in-technology-for-education-3","Stockman, C.","2018","Calm mathematics and rational logic aren’t often the drivers of human behaviour. In any classroom setting where technology is used, a teacher will necessarily have to communicate in a way that is intelligible to the machine. The software was developed with the aims of clarity and predictable functionality in its design. But this may be opposing to the many small, chaotic engagements which are part of the vibrant and multi-actor context of a classroom. The chasm between the desired determinism of technology for education and the constructivist, interpretive stance of its end users does not necessarily constitute an insurmountable conflict. Instead of trying to simplify the messiness of human life, it can aim to accommodate and complement its strengths. It is an opportunity for partnership, and technology can be developed in a way that supports a different human-machine relationship – one which is less time-consuming, more compatible, and better suited to the teaching and learning environment. In revisiting the original idea of man-computer symbiosis, this paper explores an alternative place for technology in education, and a different aim in its development – from tool to partner.","AI","University of Winchester"

Both this discrepancy and victims’ views about their vulnerability need addressing as they may identify further training needs for Criminal Justice System agencies and to ensure victims receive appropriate support. Using data from the Metropolitan Police User Satisfaction Survey (n = 47,560) the present study explored 1) crime victims' self-reported vulnerability and its association with demographics; 2) police identification of vulnerability and; 3) whether the needs of vulnerable victims were catered for.  Results indicated that 38% of the sample self-identified as vulnerable, a considerably higher percentage than estimated in previous literature. Although associations existed between vulnerability and demographics these were negligible or had weak effect sizes. The findings are discussed in relation to the current definition of a vulnerable victim and highlighting the role of personal circumstances in self-identification.","AI","University of Winchester"

Outcomes are evaluated in terms of increased recruitment of non-traditional students and also increased retention of these students. Retention initiatives have gradually become more nuanced; there has been a shift from models of support for students towards ones of engagement with students. This has involved a change in focus from instrumental support such as study skills to address deficits in academic performance to more holistic approaches aimed at enhancing student integration within the university community. This paper describes a retention programme that aims to help students integrate socially with other students and staff. By supporting students’ growth of identity and social belonging, it aims to increase engagement with their academic work. Students whose profiles pose greater risk of leaving early, such as mature students and those living at home while studying locally, were investigated in the evaluation and appeared to benefit","AI","University of Winchester"

Approximately 5 in every 1,000 adults in the United Kingdom have bronchiectasis. Exercise reduces dyspnoea, increases exercise tolerance and improves quality of life in patients with chronic respiratory disease and is an effective method of secretion clearance.Patients with bronchiectasis have reduced exercises tolerance and are less active than the general population. Many do not participate in pulmonary rehabilitation but the reasons for this are unclear. No evidence currently exists regarding the attitudes of bronchiectasis patients towards exercise, and barriers to compliance. In order to introduce effective measures to increase adherence to exercise, reasons for poor adherence and potential barriers need to be identified.Aim: To explore the views of adult bronchiectasis patients towards exercise.Method: A qualitative study was carried out, consisting of semi-structured interviews with ten adult patients with bronchiectasis at a single site in the north west of England. Perceptions of exercise, potential barriers to exercise and potential facilitators of exercise were explored. Thematic analysis was used to code the data and identify themes.Findings: Five main themes were identified following the analysis:Facilitators to exercise e.g. enjoyment, pacing and adaptation, self–motivation.Barriers to exercise e.g. embarrassment regarding symptoms, breathlessness, fear of exacerbating symptoms.Exercise has a positive impact on health and life expectancyGrief regarding loss of abilityDefinitions of exerciseConclusion: These findings suggest that there are a number of shared facilitators and barriers to exercise between bronchiectasis patients. Participants recognised that exercise was positive, but had differing perceptions on what ‘exercise’ actually entailed. Future research needs to further explore potential barriers and facilitators to exercise in this patient group on a larger scale. This could then lead to the use of behaviour change models to aid participation in exercise. These findings indicate that healthcare professionals should consider bronchiectasis patients holistically in order to aid compliance with exercise. Healthcare professionals need to reflect on their role in exercise advice and prescription, and the language used when doing so.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Change of plans: An evaluation of the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of successful talent transfer","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/change-of-plans-an-evaluation-of-the-effectiveness-and-underlying","","12 May 2014","Talent transfer (TT) is a recently formalised process used to identify and develop talented athletes by selecting individuals who have already succeeded in one sport and transferring them to another. Despite the increasing popularity of TT amongst national organisations and sport governing body professionals, however, there is little empirical evidence as to its efficacy or how it may be most efficiently employed. Accordingly, this investigation was designed to gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of TT, achieved through a two-part study. Stage 1 provided a quantitative analysis of the incidence and distribution or, in this respect, epidemiology of TT, finding the most popular transfer to be sprinting to bobsleigh, with an average transfer age of 19 years. Stage 2 scrutinised the TT process and explored the specific cases revealed in stage 1 by examining the perceptions of four sport science support specialists who had worked in TT settings, finding several emergent themes which, they felt, could explain the TT processes. The most prominent theme was the psychosocial mechanism of TT, an aspect currently missing from TT initiatives, suggesting that current TT systems are poorly structured and should redress their approach to develop a more integrated scheme that encompasses all potential mechanisms of transfer.","AI","University of Winchester"

In education contexts different elements exist that have the potential to impact on the area of focus that teachers aim to research. When designing a research project, it is important for teachers to find out what other work has been done in teachers' area of focus. Identify search terms related to teachers' research focus and use these to carry out electronic searches to find literature such as journal articles and reports that will help teachers develop their research design.","AI","University of Winchester"

Whilst a liberal use of the term has ensued, a plethora of research interprets tranquillity primarily with noise, and where broader interpretations are progressed, traditional, directional questioning techniques are evident in attempts to understand tranquillity and quantify its features. Surprisingly, few enquiries have taken a broader, inductive approach to determining the range of stakeholders’ views and of these even fewer have engaged specifically with local residents and particularly those classed as hard-to-reach. Using these latter approaches, of the few and most recent studies conducted, the Broadly Engaging with Tranquillity project provides a replicable framework for determining and mapping tranquillity. An extensive community engagement process launched the study, using participatory principles from which stakeholders’ views were modelled using Geographical Information Systems. Results of this research are reported together with an interpretation of the models created according to four distinct groups representing views of institutions and members of the public. Similar views are identified amongst the groups with tranquillity commonly related to natural environments, whereas nontranquillity was primarily equated to seeing and hearing people and the products of human activity. Yet distinctions are identified between the four groups that have important implications for who should be involved in determining local characteristics of tranquillity and for how protected area managers might include nonexpert views in their understanding and conservation of tranquillity.","AI","University of Winchester"

Worrals of the WAAF, fiction, and girls’ informal wartime education","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/no-fear-of-flying-worrals-of-the-waaf-fiction-and-girls-informal-","","21 Jan 2016","AbstractThis article focuses on the series of 11 books about a young female pilot, Worrals of the WAAF, by W.E. Johns, creator of Biggles. The Worrals books were published from 1941 when recruitment for the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force was falling. Johns chose to ignore that the WAAF supported pilots through their work on the ground and did not themselves fly. The article discusses how historians of education can draw on fiction in order to identify aspects of informal education, especially during wartime, when so many children’s formal schooling was disrupted or non-existent. Drawing on Erica Jong’s 1970s metaphor of “flying” as representative of female freedom, it is possible to read Worrals’ character as a role model for teenage girls. The conundrum of why Johns chose to put Worrals in the WAAF, rather than in Air Transport with the likes of Amy Johnson, is further explored in the light of evidence that a number of WAAF were seconded to the SOE. It concludes that fiction read alongside a range of other evidence offers a rich source for the historian engaged in a search for the gendered nature of education beyond the classroom.","AI","University of Winchester"

Furthermore, we are developing the MESHConnect initiative that aims to create and engage communities of teachers both in and with research. This initiative aims to develop teachers by engaging them in the broader community of researchers in education, so that they are able to develop a critical perspective on research to inform their own professional practices.","AI","University of Winchester"

This creates a dilemma for personal constructivist researchers, who now have access to a plethora of methods for understanding and intervening in people’s sensemaking processes but are faced with a distinct absence of a uniquely personal constructivist method for analysing the emerging narratives. This paper aims to outline a Personal Construct Psychology (PCP) (Kelly, 1955) view of the person as an agentic being and provide a contextualised, step by step guide for analysing personal narratives from a Kellian perspective that encompasses identification and analysis of constructs, metaphors, roles, implicit beliefs and emotions. Kelly advocated working with the ‘whole’ person by credulously exploring their lived reality through the entirety of their emotions, cognitions and behaviours, which goes beyond an extraction of narrative themes or phenomenological interpretations contained in the realm of the person’s known world. In PCP, language is regarded as symbolic, contextual, performative, and incomplete but, unlike social constructionist approaches, the focus favours the identification and explanation of internal identity processes, social cognitions, and personal meanings, rather than how language is utilised externally as a cultural tool. By articulating an explicit process, we aim to improve the accessibility of PCP as a full research process and overcome the current limitations posed by utilising qualitative analytical methods drawn from alternative epistemologies.","AI","University of Winchester"

M.","13 Jan 2023","Modern zoos and aquariums have evolved greatly since the end of the Second World War, to become centres of conservation excellence and scientific institutions for the study of animal behaviour, ecology, husbandry management. Whilst the impact of zoos and aquariums to biodiversity conservation, population management and advancement of species care is well documented, their positive impacts on society (including the communities that they are located within) is less well known. The four established aims of the modern zoo—Conservation, Education, Recreation (Engagement) and Research—provide a strong foundation for wider review and critique of the societal value of zoos and aquariums. This article synthesises what such value may be, and how it could be measured, from a systematic review of the literature pertaining to each of these four established aims. It also recommends areas of future scientific inquiry to further study the wider impact of zoos on their local communities and on human populations and behaviour more generally. Including Wellbeing as a fifth aim of the modern zoo would also cement their wider societal value. Further scrutiny of the societal value of the modern zoo enhances the value of the zoo’s living collection and the green spaces that it manages to provide accessibility to biodiversity and nature-centric education essential to long-term, planetary friendly human behaviour change.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Rescue Archaeology: Foundations for the Future","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/rescue-archaeology-foundations-for-the-future-3","Everill, P.","15 Sep 2015","This new publication assesses the current frameworks within which archaeology is practised in Britain in 22 chapters written by currently practising archaeologists.  The political and cultural landscape within which archaeology is practised four decades after the (1974) appearance of RESCUE Archaeology, edited by Philip Rahtz is very different and yet RESCUE’s principal campaign aims still remain relevant. Mirroring the structure of the 1974 publication, the new publication is organised into several distinct sections which outline the current frameworks within which archaeologists operate; their experiences; significant threats to the historic environment; and how current practitioners view the future of the profession.  SECTION ONE: Current Frameworks; provides an outline of the organisational, legal and research frameworks that govern contemporary British archaeology. Contributions review significant developments in these areas in recent years, considering the positives alongside the challenges faced by archaeologists involved in developing and/ or implementing initiatives, setting the scene for discussion of specific experiences, crises, and possible future directions.  SECTION TWO: Experiences of the 21st Century Archaeologist; provides individual, reflective accounts from archaeologists at various career stages, undertaking a variety of roles. The aim is to deliver an accurate picture of the challenges faced by those across the profession; how their roles may have changed/ developed; and their working environment. The individual contributions present case-studies in differing aspects of archaeological employment.  SECTION THREE: Crisis Points; identifies five key crisis points faced by the profession, each of which impacts on preservation or investigation of archaeological remains, or on professional practice. Each chapter establishes the historic development of these areas of concern.  SECTION FOUR : Rescuing the Future; outlines six broad areas in which discussion needs to be encouraged across the profession to ensure that it is fit to face the next 40 years. These themes relate very closely to the principal aims expressed at the foundation of RESCUE, and concern funding, training, legislation and communication with the public.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Critical Thinking Performance Increases in Psychology Undergraduates Measured Using a Workplace-Recognized Test","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/critical-thinking-performance-increases-in-psychology-undergradua","Prat-Sala, M.","17 Sep 2020","Background: Higher education institutions and universities aim to provide students with a range of transferable skills that enable them to become more thoughtful and effective employees, citizens, and consumers. One of these skills is critical thinking.Objective: The aim of the present research was to examine whether taking a psychology degree is concomitant with students’ increase in critical thinking skills when students are not explicitly taught critical thinking. Method: Study 1 utilized a crosssectional design and Study 2 a longitudinal design. The Watson and Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA, UK) was used to measure critical thinking. Results: For both studies, the overall scores of WGCTA, as well as scores of the subtest of Recognition of Assumptions, were significantly higher for final-year than for first-year students. Conclusion: From the findings, we conclude that the levels of critical thinking by final-year psychology students may be enhanced. Teaching implications: We propose that teaching other aspects of critical thinking such as Evaluation of Arguments and Interpretation, as measured by this test, could be beneficial in further developing psychology students’ overall critical thinking performance.","AI","University of Winchester"

This is a progressive model consisting of three stages of acquaintance, adaption and application bounded by three major influencing issues of culture, communication and context. The Triple A framework is aimed to be flexible to apply to most styles of research yet robust enough to offer useful insights.FindingsThe model devised will assist (information management) researchers with choices of research approaches. It may be that early career researchers or those undertaking a postgraduate research will find this framework especially helpful to clarify thoughts and direction. The model aims to be useful and, whilst no doubt will be built on in future research, it is offered as foundation, an initial starting point, as those who work and study in information management fields endeavor to make new choices in our digitally managed information world.Originality/valueThe originality and value of this work is the proposition of a new model that will allow researchers to impose structure on ideas and encourage the viewing of work from a multi-disciplinary perspective within the growing and evolving digital areas.","AI","University of Winchester"

Methods Bladder tissue was obtained from patients with painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (n=14) and normal histology from University Hospital Southampton tissue bank. Sequential tissue slices were immunohistochemically stained for MC subtypes using anti-MC tryptase (for MCT and MCTC) and anti-MC chymase (for MCTC). Stained sections were photographed, and positively stained MCs were quantified using ImageJ. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and individual paired t-tests. Results There was a significant difference in the density of MCs between each layer of the disease bladder, with the greatest accumulation within the detrusor (p<0.001). There was a significant increase in MCTC subtype in the lamina (p=0.009) in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis. Conclusions Our results suggest that mastocytosis is present within all layers of disease bladder, especially the muscle layer. The varying increase in MC subtypes in the lamina and mucosa may explain the variability in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis symptoms. A high influx of MCTC in the mucosa of individuals who also had ulceration noted within their diagnostic notes may be of the Hunner’s ulcer subclassification. These findings suggest a relationship between the pathogenesis of MC subtypes and the clinical presentation of painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis. A cohort study would further elucidate the diagnostic and/or therapeutic potential of MCs in patients with painful bladder syndrome/ interstitial cystitis.","AI","University of Winchester"

However, to be of value in a clinical setting these assessments must be simple to conduct and reliable. OBJECTIVE: Using oscillometric pulse wave analysis (PWA), determine the upper limit for between-day reliability of central SBP (cSBP) and central pressure augmentation (AIx) responses to three progressive stages of submaximal exercise in a cohort of young, healthy participants.METHODS: Fifteen healthy males [25.8 years (SD 5.7), 23.9 kg/m (SD 2.5)] were tested on three different mornings in a fasted state, separated by a maximum of 14 days. Central hemodynamic variables were assessed on the left upper arm. Participants underwent three progressive stages of submaximal cycling at 50 W (low), 100 W (moderate) and 150 W (moderate-hard).RESULTS: During low and moderate-intensity exercise the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values for cSBP (0.79-0.80) and AIx (0.81-0.85) indicated excellent reliability (ICC > 0.75). For the moderate-hard intensity AIx could not be computed, and the ICC for cSBP was adequate (0.72). CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest that, at least in a young, healthy cohort, oscillometric PWA can be used to reliably assess central blood pressure measurements during exercise, up to a moderate intensity. Although further work is required to verify these findings in clinical cohorts, these measurements may potentially provide clinicians with a practical option for obtaining important hemodynamic information beyond that provided by resting peripheral blood pressure.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Associations of lower-limb atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis with cardiovascular risk factors and disease in older adults: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/associations-of-lower-limb-atherosclerosis-and-arteriosclerosis-w","Faulkner, J.","3 Nov 2021","Background & aims: Atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis contribute to vascular aging and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Both processes can be assessed simply in the lower-limbs and reflect systemic pathology. However, only atherosclerosis is routinely assessed, typically via ankle-brachial index (ABI). Arteriosclerosis can be assessed using femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (faPWV), but no studies have identified whether ABI and faPWV similarly associate with overt CVD and risk factors, nor whether faPWV confers additional information. The aims of this study were to (i) compare associations of ABI and faPWV with traditional CVD risk factors, including age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), smoking, and diabetes; and (ii) determine the independent and additive associations of ABI and faPWV with a composite measure of prevalent CVD. Methods: We evaluated ABI and faPWV in 4330 older-aged (75.3 ± 5.0 years) adults using an oscillometric screening device. Associations between ABI and faPWV with CVD risk factors and CVD were determined using mixed-model linear- and logistic-regression. Results: ABI and faPWV were associated with age, HDL, and smoking. ABI was associated with sex, TC, diabetes. faPWV was associated with SBP. Both ABI and faPWV were inversely associated with CVD. Low ABI (≤0.9 vs. >0.9) and low faPWV (≤9.94 vs. >9.94) increased the odds of CVD by 2.41-fold (95% CI:1.85,3.17) and 1.46-fold (95% CI:1.23,1.74), respectively. The inverse association between faPWV and CVD was independent of ABI and CVD risk factors. Conclusions: ABI and faPWV, measures of lower-limb atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, are independently associated with CVD risk factors and prevalent CVD. Assessment of faPWV may confer additional risk information beyond ABI.","AI","University of Winchester"

These have been launched across Wessex as part of the Healthier Together (HT) project and consist of a website and paper-based resources designed to provide easily accessible facts about common childhood conditions, advice on actions to take in the event of certain symptoms and when and where to seek medical help. Eighteen semistructured interviews were conducted to investigate parents’ experiences of and reactions to the resources. We investigated perceived effects on parental understandings and feelings about childhood illness and help seeking behaviours. We discuss findings under four main headings: Parental interaction with HT resources, Parents’ anxieties concerning their children’s health, Positive evaluation and Areas for improvement. Parents positively evaluated the aims of the project and the information provided. A small number gave examples of resulting behaviour change and several anticipated future changes. Parents expressed anxiety about childhood illness and making treatment decisions. They required simple and easy to navigate resources including prominent risk assessment information. Communication by health professionals that reassures and empowers parents was also seen as important. Whilst this was a small study we believe that the findings are of relevance to others producing, disseminating and explaining health information aimed at parents and other patient groups.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Semantic enablers for dynamic digital–physical object associations in a federated node architecture for the Internet of Things","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/semantic-enablers-for-dynamic-digitalphysical-object-associations","","Jul 2014","The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm aims to realize heterogeneous physical world objects interacting with each other and with the surrounding environment. In this prospect, the automatic provisioning of the varied possible interactions and bridging them with the digital world is a key pertinent issue for enabling novel IoT applications. The introduction of description logic-based semantics to provide homogeneous descriptions of object capabilities enables lowering the heterogeneity and a limited set of interactions (such as those with stationary objects with fixed availability) to be deduced using classical reasoning systems. However, the inability of such semantics to capture the dynamics of an IoT system as well as the scalability issues that reasoning systems encounter if too many descriptions have to be processed, necessitate that such approaches should be used in conjunction with others. Towards this aim, this paper proposes an automated rule-based association mechanism for integrating the digital IoT components with physical entities along temporal–spatial–thematic axes. To address the scalability issue, this mechanism is distributed over a federated network of nodes, each embodying a set of objects located in the same geographical area. Nodes covering nearby geographical areas can share their object descriptions while all nodes are capable of deducing interactions between the descriptions that they are aware of.","AI","University of Winchester"

These involved large-scale austerity measures and drastic reductions in public sector spending including healthcare. Within this context and in line with the international best practice guidelines for primary care, in August 2017 the left-wing SYRIZA government passed a law for the reform of the Primary Health Care (PHC) sector. The reform introduced the establishment of Local Health Units and the embedded notion of the ‘family doctor’ as the first pillar of healthcare provision. These reforms aimed to strengthen primary care and to improve access to publicly provided primary care services. Despite the promising claims, the reform was a subject of criticism and failed to engage key stakeholder groups and to be delivered within the original timeline. The aim of this paper is to present the chronicle of the reform, its current status at a national level and its implementation challenges. To address current implementation hindrances, the reform of the Greek PHC sector is expected to undergo systemic changes, including factoring in the scheme's funding needs after 2021, with the successive government reconsidering its future form.","AI","University of Winchester"

M.","30 Apr 2018","Social media is a phenomenon of the 21st Century and its use enables scientific, conservation and educational organisations a much wider reach into the lives of interested (and potential interested) parties more than ever before. When well used, social media can have a positive impact on awareness of current, important issues, and be a useful tool in garnering public support for a particular cause or message. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a specific trend in the use of social media (Facebook) by BIAZA-accredited zoos when putting together content to share with an online audience. We calculated the average percentage of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates for nine UK zoos. We tested the hypothesis that posts presented on Facebook would not reflect the diversity of the animal collection. Results show a heavy bias towards mammals, in not only the number of posts but also in the engagement (likes and shares) with such posts. Zoos also announce births and new hatchings via social media more than expected, which could be a useful way of engaging an online audience with important conservation issues and rationalising why species are housed in captivity. Posts overtly conservation- or education-based were limited in number, and attracted little following. There was a highly significant correlation between both the number of likes that a post received and the number of times it was shared. It is possible that if zoos diversified the range of subjects to highlight key aspects of biology and ecology in their Facebook posts, more engagement with key aims of the modern zoo would arise with an online audience.","AI","University of Winchester"

Care homes have endeavored to utilize this approach but have struggled to find a design and approach that works for this setting. Aims: Study aims were to appraise the evolving concept of MSEs from a user perspective, to study the aesthetic and functional qualities, to identify barriers to staff engagement with a sensory environment approach, and to identify design criteria to improve the potential of MSE for people with dementia. Methods: Data were collected from 16 care homes with experience of MSE using ethnographic methods, incorporating semi-structured interviews, and observations of MSE design. Analysis was undertaken using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: Observations revealed equipment that predominantly stimulated vision and touch. Thematic analysis of the semi-structured interviews revealed six themes: not knowing what to do in the room, good for people in the later stages of the disease, reduces anxiety, it’s a good activity, design and setting up of the space, and including relatives and care staff. Conclusion: Few MSEs in care homes are designed to meet needs of people with dementia, and staff receive little training in how to facilitate sessions. As such, MSEs are often underused despite perceived benefits. Results of this study have been used to identify the design principles that have been reviewed by relevant stakeholders.","AI","University of Winchester"

This acceleration has been linked to poor lifestyle behaviors and subsequent cardio-metabolic complications. Although the clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors has been recognized for over two decades, previous studies in children have predominantly examined the relationships between atherosclerosis and individual cardio-metabolic risk factors, or have grouped together pre-adolescent and adolescent children. Further, no known studies have included glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), or central hemodynamic measures such as central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and augmentation index (AIx). Methods and Results: Principal component analysis was performed on a cross-sectional sample of 392 children (9.5 y, 50% F) from three representative sample sites across New Zealand. Four factors explained 60% of the variance in the measured variables. In order of variance explained, the factors were: blood pressure (cSBP, peripheral systolic and diastolic blood pressure), adiposity (waist circumference, body mass index, HbA1c), lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins) and vascular (AIx, heart rate, fasting blood glucose [FBG]).  Conclusions: In accordance with previous findings in adults and adolescents, one common factor is unlikely to define cardio-metabolic health in pre-adolescent children. Each of the factors, except vascular, which was predominantly explained by AIx, are in agreement with previous findings in adolescents. An additional novel finding was that HbA1c and FBG loaded on to different factors, supporting previous work suggesting that FBG indicates short-term glycemic control whereas HbA1c reflects chronic glycemic control.

Parliament could respond to this concern by passing legislation that implements fixed buffer zones around all clinics providing abortion services in England and Wales. This would make it an offence to engage in prohibited behaviour (as defined by the legislation) within a specified area around abortion clinics. Such legislation may be challenged, however, on the basis that it interferes with the rights afforded to demonstrators by Articles 9, 10, and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This article examines the proportionality of fixed buffer zone legislation, which has not yet been considered by the European Court of Human Rights nor the UK Supreme Court. Two relationships are considered: first, the relationship between the aims of the measures and the means to achieve those aims; second, the relationship between the competing interests of demonstrators opposing abortion and clinic-users seeking an abortion. This article shows that fixed buffer zone legislation can be proportionate. Consequently, the ECHR is no impediment to the enactment of fixed buffer zone legislation in England and Wales.","AI","University of Winchester"

M.","1 Dec 2019","The modern zoo’s roles command empirical enquiry to determine the effectiveness of zoos locally and globally. Ten years ago, published work identified the need for empirical research on a diverse range of species beyond charismatic zoo megafauna. We review zoo-based research published in the decade since this original recommendation. We collectively evaluate zoo-themed research papers from those working in zoos and those external to zoos but studying zoo-housed animals. By systematically searching Web of Science© for zoo-based research and performing inductive content analysis to code year, journal, study animal’s taxonomic classification, and research aims and outputs we evaluate trends in zoo-themed research, contrasted with trends in species holding. Significantly more birds and fish are kept compared to mammals, reptiles and amphibians, but mammals are consistently the primary research focus. Whilst output generally rises, only for birds is a steady increase in publications apparent. Husbandry evaluation is a major aim/output, but papers on pure biology, cognition and health also feature. Most publications lead to “specific advancement of knowledge” including validation of methodologies. We show that: (1) trends in species holdings are unrelated to trends in publication; (2) zoo-themed research makes meaningful contributions to science; (3) zoo researchers should diversify their aim/output categories and chosen study species to close the persisting research gaps that we have identified. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of evident species biases within research outputs across the broader fields of zoology, conservation and ecology.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Aspects of agency: change and constraint in the activism of Mary Sumner founder of the Anglican Mothers’ Union","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/aspects-of-agency-change-and-constraint-in-the-activism-of-mary-s-3","Anderson-Faithful, S.","5 Jul 2017","Abstract: This article defines agency as the ability to act towards the realisation of aims within and across the permeable boundaries of private and public space.  Agency relates to both empowerment and constraint as the aims of certain groups may be realised by dominating others. This article explores the agency of Mary Sumner as founder of the Mothers’ Union (1876), which by 1921 had a transnational membership in excess of 390,000 and thus constituted the largest women’s organisation in the Anglican Church. In this article Bourdieu’s concepts of reproduction, habitus, field and capital frame the analysis of Sumner’s agency in relation to her own empowerment and constraint, and as an activist for the patriarchal and socially stratified Church of England. It locates Sumner’s activism in the context of clerical networks and identifies strategies she deployed to establish her own pedagogic authority and advance her organisation. Focusing on the years 1876 to 1916, the article argues that Sumner promoted opportunities for women within her temporal and socio-cultural context in ways that were complicit with patriarchal Anglican notions of womanhood and upheld class stratification yet were simultaneously innovative in achieving a voice for an organised body of women within Anglicanism.","AI","University of Winchester"

"A Survey on an Emerging Area: Deep Learning for Smart City Data","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/a-survey-on-an-emerging-area-deep-learning-for-smart-city-data","","1 May 2019","Rapid urbanisation has brought about great challenges to our daily lives, such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, energy consumption, public safety and so on. Research on smart cities aims to address these issues with various technologies developed for the Internet of Things. Very recently, the research focus has shifted towards processing of massive amount of data continuously generated within a city environment, e.g., physical and participatory sensing data on traffic flow, air quality, and healthcare. Techniques from computational intelligence have been applied to process and analyse such data, and to extract useful knowledge that helps citizens better understand their surroundings and informs city authorities to provide better and more efficient public services. Deep learning, as a relatively new paradigm in computational intelligence, has attracted substantial attention of the research community and demonstrated greater potential over traditional techniques. This paper provides a survey of the latest research on the convergence of deep learning and smart city from two perspectives: while the technique-oriented review pays attention to the popular and extended deep learning models, the application-oriented review emphasises the representative application domains in smart cities. Our study showed that there are still many challenges ahead for this emerging area owing to the complex nature of deep learning and wide coverage of smart city applications. We pointed out a number of future directions related to deep learning efficiency, emergent deep learning paradigms, knowledge fusion and privacy preservation, and hope these would move the relevant research one step further in creating truly distributed intelligence for smart cities.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Risk, Human Health, and the Oppression of Nonhuman Animals: The Development of Transgenic Nonhuman Animals for Human Use.","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/risk-human-health-and-the-oppression-of-nonhuman-animals-the-deve","","1 Sep 2011","In May 2009, the journal Nature published an article by Erika Sasaki et al. outlining a research development in biomedical science that, the authors argue, will provide new possibilities for using nonhuman primates in experiments for human health benefits. The authors claim that their research offers the potential for the reproduction of transgenic marmosets who, because of their “close genetic relations with humans” (523), might be extremely useful in advances designed to reduce the risks from a range of human health hazards. By conducting a critical analysis of the article, I will explore moral questions connected with experiments on nonhuman animals, in order to reflect upon assumptions central to claims about the progress that such nonhuman animal experiments are said to represent. My discussion is rooted in sociological theorizing about risk because, as Sasaki and her colleagues’ work demonstrates, biogenetics is being used to amplify risks to nonhuman animal health for the purpose of reducing risks to human health. Sociological theory allows us to examine assumptions about distinctions between humans and nonhuman animals, and among nonhuman animals, that intensify the commodification of nonhuman animals. Critical discourse analysis allows us to unveil assumptions made by Sasaki et al. that serve a logic of scientific advancement driven by human preoccupation with human benefits at the expense of nonhuman animals, which, I conclude, conflicts with human moral progress.My aims are reflected in the structure of the paper. The opening section explores risk and human health with a focus on the ways in which humans have sought, via biomedical research, to reduce human risks from health hazards. This is followed by consideration of how experiments using nonhuman animals have been utilized in the quest to diminish human health risks. This leads me to Sasaki et al.’s (2009) article. By using a critical discourse analytical approach, I reflect upon notions of “progress” as rooted in the aspiration to transfer to nonhuman animals a range of health hazards that we seek to eliminate in the human. I conclude that interfering with the genetics of nonhuman animals with the aim of engendering in them a predisposition to develop health hazards that we want to eliminate in humans represents human degeneration rather than progress.","AI","University of Winchester"

A.","1 Sep 2009","The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a novel crank system on laboratory time-trial cycling performance. The Rotor system makes each pedal independent from the other so that the cranks are no longer fixed at 180°. Twelve male competitive but non-elite cyclists (mean ± s: 35 ± 7 yr, Wmax = 363 ± 38 W, VO2peak = 4.5 ± 0.3 L·min-1) completed 6-weeks of their normal training using either a conventional (CON) or the novel Rotor (ROT) pedal system. All participants then completed two 40.23-km time-trials on an air-braked ergometer, one using CON and one using ROT. Mean performance speeds were not different between trials (CON = 41.7 km·h-1 vs. ROT = 41.6 km·h-1, P > 0.05). Indeed, the pedal system used during the time-trials had no impact on any of the measured variables (power output, cadence, heart rate, VO2, RER, gross efficiency). Furthermore, the ANOVA identified no significant interaction effect between main effects (Time-trial crank system*Training crank system, P > 0.05). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of the Rotor system on endurance performance rather than endurance capacity. These results suggest that the Rotor system has no measurable impact on time-trial performance. However, further studies should examine the importance of the Rotor 'regulation point' and the suggestion that the Rotor system has acute ergogenic effects if used infrequently.","AI","University of Winchester"
"To pace or not to pace? A review of what abnormal repetitive behavior tells us about zoo animal management","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/to-pace-or-not-to-pace-a-review-of-what-abnormal-repetitive-behav","Riley, L. M.","6 Mar 2017","Performance of abnormal repetitive behavior (ARB) is noted in many captive wild species. ARB can be categorized into 2 basic forms: those whose aim appears to be to compulsively reach an inappropriate goal and those whose performance is linked to an inappropriate motor function. Although the negative welfare connotations of ARBs are well known, the precise reason for their performance remains the subject of debate. As zoos move forward in collection planning and to gather more evidence on the biological needs of the species being kept, the idea that ARBs may be part of a coping function adds more weight to arguments that some species may not be suitable for the zoo at all. Modern-day definitions of animal welfare tell us to measure the well-being of the individual based on its attempts at coping with its immediate environment. A failure to cope, and hence performance of ARB, is an objective and measurable welfare metric that may highlight which species are appropriate for captivity. As conservation pressures on zoos mount, and the need to take in more captive-naive species increases, research on why captive wild animals develop ARB can be used to inform practice. In this article, we aim to review the welfare issues across 3 basic categories of zoo animal (mammals, birds, and ectothermic vertebrates) and critique how research into ARBs can be used by zoos to promote wild-type behavior patterns by providing biologically relevant management and husbandry regimes, which allow animals the key components of control and choice over what they do and how they do it.","AI","University of Winchester"

In particular, this study aimed to explore which psychosocial behaviors are essential, the process of how these might influence coaching practice, and how the development of psychosocial behaviors should be encouraged. Eight elite, experienced S&C coaches were recruited and partook in a semistructured interview. Using a reflexive thematic analysis, six themes were identified: understanding athlete’s needs, communicating effectively, caring and connecting with the athlete, practicing what you preach, the importance of reflective practice, and the contribution of formal training. The findings of this study enhance the literature by highlighting that elite, experienced S&C coaches perceive psychosocial behaviors to be essential in effective S&C coaching practice. In particular, the findings describe the processes of how identified psychosocial behaviors might positively influence athlete development by enhancing motivation, buy-in, and autonomy. In addition, the authors’ results suggest that current S&C coach development programs are limited in facilitating the learning of psychosocial behaviors. Thus, their findings strengthen the call for S&C coach educators to utilize constructivist learning strategies including facilitated reflection to encourage the development of essential psychosocial behaviors that contribute to the holistic development of the athlete.

As national governments set targets to aim to reduce carbon emissions, cities are increasingly expected to play a major role in transitions to low-carbon society. Focusing on transport, this paper examines the case of an integrated mobility system in a Japanese city to understand how new urban infrastructures link to sustainable lifestyles. We take a systemic network approach, which looks at not only technological, economic and political aspects, but also social and human aspects in the system, and embraces a diversity of individuals and organisations that are involved in the sociotechnical system. Our empirical study is situated in Kashiwa City, Chiba Prefecture. The city is located 31 km east of Tokyo and has a population of c.414,000. It is well communicated with three major railway lines, and 42 per cent of the population commutes to Tokyo. In light of climate change and global warming (as well as aging society), Kashiwa aims to become a city where people can live without excessively depending on cars and can cycle and walk safely by improving local transport infrastructures such as public, community and shared buses, and associated facilities. This city-led integrated mobility strategy brings a diverse mode of transport together through ICT and has the potential to change people’s lifestyles. We explore how the city plans to manage such an integrated system, in relation to the national government’s strategy for low-carbon society, and how actors in the local mobility system such as railway companies and technology providers envisage the local transition to a low-carbon city that are universal and inclusive.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Glutamine depletion and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in children with meningococcal disease","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/glutamine-depletion-and-heat-shock-protein-70-hsp70-in-children-w","","2 Sep 2014","Background & aims: Heat shock proteins are classified into six main families, of which HSP70 is the best studied. HSP70 is postulated to modulate the immune/inflammatory response in critical illness. Glutamine promotes HSP70 release, however, little is known about the relationship between glutamine and HSP70 in paediatric critical illness. We therefore aimed to describe plasma levels of HSP70, inflammatory mediators and glutamine in critically ill children.  Methods: A clinical audit identified 143 children with severe meningococcal disease, 78 convalescent children, in addition to 35 healthy paediatric controls. Stored plasma was used to measure plasma concentrations of HSP70, inflammatory mediators and glutamine.  Results: HSP70 was significantly increased on admission (n = 143, mean 26.7 ng/ml; ±SD 79.95) compared with convalescence (n = 78, mean 3.16 ng/ml; ±SD 5.67). Glutamine levels were low (n = 132, mean 0.31 mmol/l; ±SD 0.13), which continued in convalescence (n = 65, mean 0.40 mmol/l; ±SD 0.14). Enteral glutamine provided only 28% of the recommendations. Glutamine was inversely correlated with length-of-stay (n = 98, r = -0.520, p < 0.001), ventilation (n = 98, r = -0.513, p < 0.001), lactate (n = 98, r = -0.41, p < 0.001) and CRP (n = 98, r = -0.51, p < 0.001). HSP70 was correlated with length-of-stay (n = 99, r = 0.30, p < 0.001), ventilation (n = 99, r = 0.31, p < 0.001), lactate (n = 99, r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and CRP (n = 99, r = 0.29, p < 0.001) and inflammatory mediators. There was no relationship between glutamine and HSP70 or inflammatory mediators.  Conclusions: During acute illness HSP70/inflammatory mediators are significantly increased, and glutamine is significantly depleted. However, glutamine and HSP70 were not correlated. Enteral feeds only provided a small proportion of the ASPEN/ESPEN recommendations for glutamine.","AI","University of Winchester"

Validation of the models is limited by the lack of detailed experimental data. Three dimensional imaging data provides an opportunity to address this unmet need. Radioactive aerosol was administered to each of 11 healthy male subjects on two occasions under carefully monitored input conditions. Input parameters varied were particle size, depth of breathing, carrier gas and posture. The aerosol distribution was measured by combined single photon emission computed tomography and X-ray computer tomography (SPECT/CT). Airway anatomy was determined by high resolution CT imaging. The distribution of deposition was determined by a combination of 2D and 3D analysis and described in terms of the percentage of inhaled aerosol deposited in sections of the respiratory tract and in both spatial and anatomical sub-divisions within each lung. The percentage deposition in the conducting airways was also assessed by 24. h clearance. A set of imaging data of aerosol deposition has been produced in which the input parameters of inhalation are well described. The parameters were varied in a controlled manner to allow the sensitivity of predictive models to different factors to be tested. An initial analysis of the data is presented which will act as a guide that other centers can use to compare their own methodology. This data is considered to be of great potential value to computer modelers of aerosol deposition in validating their models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","AI","University of Winchester"

Our aim was to understand how governing body nurses perceive their influence and leadership on clinical commissioning groups. Methods: An online survey method was used with a census sample of 238 governing body nurses and nurses working in Commissioning Support Units, who were members of the Commissioning Nurse Leaders' Network. The response rate was 40.7% (n = 97). Results: While most governing body nurses felt confident in their leadership role, this was less so for non-executive governing body nurses. Nurses in Commissioning Support Units were much less positive than governing body nurses about their influence on clinical commissioning groups. Conclusion: Governing body nurses were satisfied with their impact on clinical commissioning groups and so could be said to be leading a nursing agenda but this evidence is limited to their own perceptions and more objective or diverse measures of impact are needed. The purpose of such roles to ‘represent nursing, and ensure the patient voice is heard’ may be a flawed aspiration, conflating nursing leadership and patient voice. Implications for nursing management: This is the first study to explore explicitly the differences between executive and non-executive governing body nurses and nurses working in commissioning support units. Achieving clinical commissioning groups' goals, including developing and embedding nursing leadership roles in clinical commissioning groups, may be threatened if the contributions of governing body nurses, and other nurses supporting clinical commissioning groups, go unrecognised within the profession, or if general practitioners or other clinical commissioning group executive members dominate decision-making on clinical commissioning groups.","AI","University of Winchester"

Ten years ago, Ghana’s mental health services were severely lacking, accelerated through ‘brain drain’ as trained psychiatrists and mental health nurses left the country to work overseas.  A group of UK global health workers was closely involved in a ten-year large-scale innovation aimed at helping to improve mental health services in Ghana at community level.  A new generation of mental health workers in Ghana was created adding hundreds of practitioners to the workforce, meaning that thousands of Ghanaians would potentially receive support.  The research reported here explored the UK group’s involvement to identify significant lessons learnt.   Method.  An ‘ideological narrative’ was obtained through engaging the research participants in insider practitioner research.  They were supported in this process by a university-based researcher, who offered an ‘outsider’ perspective. This novel type of narrative meant participants could not only give account of their own practice and an awareness of their own learning, but also become more aware of the significance of the often unstated, and possibly unconscious, values informing their stories.  Results.  The lessons learnt by the UK global health workers from involvement in this innovation are explored within five themes: Curriculum development as an ongoing process; ‘we are all learning’ and the notion of ‘co-development’; timescales and the importance of culture; the interconnected nature of practice; and education as development.   Conclusion.  This research is intended to help shape individual and group efforts that are involved in global health projects generally through project participants articulating the significant lessons learnt about educational change and the nature of development associated with such projects as ongoing ‘co-development’.  It also has the potential to contribute to a wider dialogue with curriculum developers, educators, and others involved in practice innovation, all of which inevitably involve others and are never ended.

Design: Parallel group, non-randomized trial with before (baseline) and after (follow-up) assessments.  Setting: Single-center, community-based neuro-physiotherapy practice.  Participants: Twelve individuals with SCI (ASI A to C).  Interventions: Participants completed either a 5-day RGT program plus physiotherapy (n = 6), or a usual care physiotherapy only program (control group; n = 6). The RGT program consisted of daily 60-min physiotherapy and 90-min of RGT. Outcome measures were measured before and after the rehabilitation program.  Main outcome measure(s): The primary outcome measure was arterial wave reflection (Augmentation index [AIx]), with central and peripheral blood pressures also reported. Data are presented as mean (SD) and effect sizes (partial eta squared; η2 p).  Results: There was a significant reduction in AIx (30 ± 18–21 ± 15%; η2 p=0.75) and mean arterial pressure (89 ± 11–82 ± 10 mmHg; η2 p=0.47) following completion of the RGT program (both P < 0.05). There were no changes in these measures for the control group. Although not significantly different, medium to large effects were observed in favor of RGT for all other central and peripheral measures (η2 p=0.06–0.21), except for heart rate and pulse pressure (η2 p<0.04).  Conclusions: RGT using an exoskeleton is a promising therapy for improving cardiovascular health in patients with SCI.

Nine male competitive but non-elite cyclists completed two 40.23-km time-trials on an air-braked ergometer (Kingcycle) in the laboratory and one 40.23-km time-trial (RD) on a local road course. One laboratory time-trial was conducted in an aerodynamic position (AP), while the second was conducted in an upright position (UP). Mean performance speed was significantly higher during laboratory trials (UP and AP) compared with the RD trial (P < 0.001). Although there was no difference in power output between the RD and UP trials (P > 0.05), power output was significantly lower during the AP trial than during both the RD (P = 0.013) and UP trials (P = 0.003). Similar correlations were found between AP power output and RD power output (r = 0.85, P = 0.003) and between UP power output and RD power output (r = 0.87, P = 0.003). Despite a significantly lower power output in the laboratory AP condition, these results suggest that body position does not affect the ecological validity of laboratory-based time-trial cycling.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Educational Resistance","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/educational-resistance","Bojesen, E.","16 May 2021","Educational resistance is, here, examined in two of its possible inflections.First, as resistance to educational imposition. Second, as a form ofresistance which might itself be educational. Jean-François Lyotard’sreflections on ’anamnesic resistance’ are developed in the context ofeducational thought, and then read up against proposals for philosophicallyinformed educational reform by Bernard Stiegler. Stiegler’sapproach, based in part on a critique of Lyotard, is called in to question,both in terms of its reading of Lyotard and the impositional educationallogic it follows. Additionally, this article incorporates a novel applicationof a practice-as research methodology, in aid of illuminating and exemplifyingthe central dimensions of its argument, utilising sound as ameans of philosophical research and ’anamnesic resistance’.","AI","University of Winchester"

When presented alongside each other, the uniqueness of both subjects can be very powerful in offering children a holistic learning experience that can also aid understanding in both areas. Both subjects can provide children with a wealth of challenge, engagement and fulfilment whilst also not forgetting the more serious nature of what both disciplines set out to achieve; core fundamental skills that every child will need throughout their life. This article serves as an illustration point for how learning through mathematics and physical education can support learning in the primary curriculum.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Judging the secret thoughts of all: Functional neuroimaging, ‘brain reading,’ and the theological ethics of privacy","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/judging-the-secret-thoughts-of-all-functional-neuroimaging-brain-","","29 Feb 2020","Of the many futuristic prospects offered by neuroscience, one of the more controversial is ‘brain reading’: the use of functional neuroimaging to gain information about subjects’ mental states or thoughts. This technology has various possible applications, including ‘neuromarketing’ and lie detection. Would such applications violate subjects’ privacy rights? Conversely, if God knows and judges all our secret thoughts, do Christians have any stake in defending a right to mental privacy? This article argues that God’s knowledge of us is different not only in degree but in kind from the knowledge sought through brain reading. This view of divine knowledge supports a theological account of privacy, richer and broader in scope than standard accounts of privacy rights, which can aid the ethical analysis of the use of brain reading technology for purposes such as marketing and lie detection.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Ecumenism and Trust: A Pope on Mount Athos","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/ecumenism-and-trust-a-pope-on-mount-athos","","17 Nov 2020","The usual way to address interdenominational differences and even the question of the (re)union between the Eastern and the Western Church is usually modelled after legal or political negotiations, i.e. with meetings at higher levels of clergy, with extensive references to the canonical tradition, which aim to achieve some sort of theological illumination, clarity, and eventually agreement or compromise. Nevertheless, the distance between the Eastern and the Western Church today (as well as between other similar historical rifts, as well as rifts that are being formed today) is more a question of psychology and (the lack of) trust, rather than politics and philosophical theology. This pursuit of trust would necessarily include the monastic tradition (Athonite monasticism in particular), which is quite influential in the way the ecumenical movement is received in the Orthodox world. To this end, along with the ongoing theological interdenominational dialogue, it is necessary to establish ways to address the lack of trust between the Eastern and the Western Church, and to recognize the pastoral need to include the contribution and voice of monasticism in the process of rapprochement between them.","AI","University of Winchester"
"A Literature Review of Interventions to Manage the Harmful Stress of Doctors","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/a-literature-review-of-interventions-to-manage-the-harmful-stress","Locke, R.; Lees, A.","1 Jan 2020","Aim	Stress is prevalent amongst doctors and interventions are offered, often as part of their continuing professional development, to help doctors learn in the workplace about the recognition, prevention and management of the harmful effects of stress.  The aim of this review was to look at existing research to determine the features of successful educational interventions and any factors that may affect outcomes.Methods We searched key databases for papers published between 1990 and 2017 on the themes of stress which included an education-based intervention and practising doctors.  Using an inclusive approach to the review, a broad evaluation was made of the primary research using both quantitative and /or qualitative evidence where the study reported a positive outcome in terms stress management.  Results Review criteria were met in 31 studies of 1356 originally retrieved.   Three broad categories of interventions emerged from the coding process: Mindfulness-type [n=12]; coping and solutions focused (CSF) [n=12]; and reflective groups [n=7].  There is evidence that these interventions can be successful to help doctors deal with stress.  Based on the results from this review, an original guide is advanced to help educators choose an educational intervention.    Conclusion  Although evidence for some interventions may be ‘hierarchically stronger’, it is misleading to assume that interventions can be imported as successfully into any context.  Factors such as medical specialty and health care systems may affect which intervention can be used. The guide offers an evidence base on which further research can be built.

To realize it, this paper contributes by doing an empirical test of the technology acceptance model, amongst those users typically always deprived in the existing social structure. Firstly, the study aims to examine the influence of Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0′s four indicators (optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity) on bKash entrepreneurs' perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) of bKash technology. Secondly, it aims to investigate the effect of ‘bKash' entrepreneurs' PEOU and PU on their well-being. A total of 360 usable data were collected from the bKash agents in Bangladesh. We employed SEM-PLS3.0 for data analysis. The results indicate that optimism and innovativeness strongly drive perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Subjective well-being was found to be strongly predicted by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The study indicates that poor people are somewhat ready to use and accept technology that leads to a sense of well-being. Bringing together the concept of subjective well-being with TRI and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is this paper's contribution to the knowledge domain.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Becoming a Primary Physical Educator","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/becoming-a-primary-physical-educator","","18 Mar 2019","Previous studies have reported that generalist primary teachers lack the confidence and competence to teach Physical Education (PE). In response, schools have outsourced PE to external providers. This paper examines data from an online survey of 175 pre-service teachers (PSTs) in England and their perceived confidence to teach primary PE. Findings showed PSTs had high levels of confidence across a breadth of knowledge areas, specifically in areas relating to lesson planning, health and fitness and the subject’s aims. Conversely, knowledge confidence was lowest in swimming, assessment and working with external providers. This paper argues that to address teacher confidence in PE, teachers must be positioned back as the main curriculum deliverers. An outcome of this research has been the development of a professional knowledge model for primary PE which recognises a breadth of professional knowledge needed to become a primary physical educator.","AI","University of Winchester"

In this paper, we aim to adapt and test the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI, Glick & Fiske, 1996), on a small, non-WEIRD sample of men in Burkina Faso. Using a within-participants experimental design we further attempt to cross-validate this adapted ASI with a behavioural measure, namely the dictator game. Generally, the adapted version of the ASI does not perform well in terms of validity and reliability. In the dictator game, women generally receive a larger proportion of the stake than men. While the allocations to male recipients are not related to participants’ levels of hostile or benevolent sexism, there is a significant negative correlation between benevolent sexism and allocations to female recipients.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Natural Love: Aquinas, Evolution and Charity","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/natural-love-aquinas-evolution-and-charity","","20 Jun 2017","This paper offers an analysis of work on human development in evolutionary anthropology from a Thomist perspective. I show that both fields view care for others as fundamental to human nature and interpret cooperative breeding as expression of the virtue of charity. I begin with an analysis of different approaches to the relationship between evolutionary anthropology and moral theory. I argue that ethical naturalism is the approach best suited to interdisciplinary dialogue, since it holds that natural facts are useful for moral theory but do not encompass it. This forms the basis for a Thomist analysis of some key features of human evolution including bipedalism, higher encephalisation and extended childhood. In each case I explain how these parts of our nature contributed to the evolution of modern humans, and how each is reliant upon communal care. Finally, I offer three observations on these facts from a Thomist perspective. Firstly, that a good human life necessarily involves caring for others and being cared for ourselves. Secondly, that this is exemplified in the virtue of charity, which is the ground of all virtue. Finally, that the need for such care shows that human flourishing cannot be attained without divine aid.","AI","University of Winchester"

The purpose of this study is to propose a process model for data-driven decision-making which provides an overarching methodology covering key stages of the business analytics life cycle. The model is then applied in two small enterprises using real customer/donor data to assist the strategic management of sales and fundraising.Design/methodology/approach:Data science is a multi-disciplinary subject that aims to discover knowledge and insight from data while providing a bridge to data-driven decision making across businesses. This paper starts with a review of established frameworks for data science and analytics before linking with process modelling and data-driven decision making. A consolidated methodology is then described covering the key stages of exploring data, discovering insights and making decisions.Findings:Representative case studies from a small manufacturing organisation and an independent hospice charity have been used to illustrate the application of the process model. Visual analytics have informed customer sales strategy and donor fundraising strategy through recommendations to the respective senior management teams.Research limitations/implications:The scope of this research has focused on customer analytics in small to medium-sized enterprise through two case studies. While the aims of these organisations are rather specific, they share a commonality of purpose for their strategic development which is addressed by this paper.Originality/value:Data science is shown to be applicable in the business environment through the proposed process model, synthesising micro- and macro- solution methodologies and allowing organisations to follow a structured procedure.

This can occur in any area of the body where two skin surfaces are in close contact with each other. The aim of this scoping review was to systematically map, review and synthesise evidence on intertrigo in adults. We identified a wide range of evidence and performed a narrative integration of this related to the diagnosis, management and prevention of intertrigo. A literature search was conducted within the following databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and EMBASE. After reviewing articles for duplicates and relevance, 55 articles were included. The incorporation of intertrigo in the ICD-11 provides a clear definition and should improve the accuracy of estimates. With regards to the diagnosis, prevention and management of intertrigo, the literature demonstrates consensus among health professionals in approach and this forms the basis for the recommendations of this review: identify predisposing factors and educate patient in reducing these; educate patients in skin fold management and adopt structured skin care routine; treat secondary infection with appropriate topical agent; consider using moisture-wicking textiles within skin folds to reduce skin-on-skin friction, wick away moisture and reduce secondary infection.

Robust methods that allow valid data collection and analysis constitute an evidence-based approach to animal care. Understanding behaviour is essential to improving animal management, and behavioural research is therefore popular, with a wide choice of behavioural methodologies and theories available. This review outlines ten methodological approaches, concepts or theories essential to zoo science that are based around behavioural observation. This list is not exhaustive but aims to define and describe key areas of consideration when planning and implementing a zoo-based behavioural project. We discuss the application of well-established methods (the construction of ethograms, use of time–activity patterns and measurement of space/enclosure use) as well as evaluating newer or less-widely applied analytical techniques, such as behavioural diversity indices, social networks analysis and Qualitative Behavioural Assessment. We also consider the importance of fundamental research methods, the application of pure science to understand and interpret zoo animal behaviour (with a review of a Tinbergian approach) and consideration of meta-analyses. The integration of observational techniques into experiments that aim to identify the cause and effect of behavioural performance is then explored, and we examine the assimilation of behavioural methods used in studies of environmental enrichment. By systematically studying animal behaviour, we can attempt to understand the welfare of individual animals in captivity, and here we present an example of our reviewed approaches to this area of zoo science. Combining multiple methodologies can lead to a greater understanding of behaviour and welfare, creating robust research, progressing husbandry and advancing conservation strategies. Collaborations between zoological collections and academic researchers (e.g., in Higher Education Institutions) can further refine and enhance the validity of research and husbandry practice alike.","AI","University of Winchester"

Tourism and cognate courses offered by higher educational institutions are essentially a part of the tourism system. This study aims to emphasize the perspective of tourism educators with respect to upcoming challenges in the tourism discipline and ways to reinvent and reboot the tourism education in the post-COVID-19 phase. The study adopted a qualitative approach and a total of 22 responses were interpreted. A thematic analysis using the Nvivo 12 plus software was done. Even though there was variability in the respondents’ background, a significant emphasis on curriculum design, industry collaboration, and excellence in research was mutually suggested by the educators. The study suggests that ambidextrous management in tourism education be adopted in post-COVID-19 phase. In other words, educators must become adept at the delivery of courses in a variety of modalities that would enable them to cope with the short and medium-term impacts of teaching in a COVID-19 (incremental innovation), while providing by anticipation of future demands (from industry and students), cutting edge curriculum (radical innovation).","AI","University of Winchester"

"‘No outlines’: From dystopia to heterotopia in Howard Jacobson’s J.","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/no-outlines-from-dystopia-to-heterotopia-in-howard-jacobsons-j-3","","1 Apr 2016","This article suggests that a dystopian reading of Howard Jacobson’s 2014 novel, J, is not necessarily the only way in which to reflect on both the inner and outer topographies of the narrative. In tilting the focus of enquiry, the article draws from Foucault’s brief, but intriguing, thoughts on heterotopia. It suggests that this kind of heterotopian thinking potentially opens up a deconstructive questioning of terms such as utopia and dystopia. In particular, the article teases out some of the ways in which Jewishness intersects with these themes.  The analysis focuses on the section towards the mid-point of J when the protagonists, Kevern and Ailinn, visit the capital city of a bleak new world. It is a profoundly dislocated and disconcerting space, described as ‘a city seen through a sheet of scratched Perspex….it had no outlines’. Within this distorted setting, Jacobson presents a sustained exploration of Jewishness, an identity that is placed, simultaneously, at both the centre and the edges of the text.","AI","University of Winchester"

Thanks to the work of civil society actors, in particular organizations like Antigone, A Buon Diritto, and Abusi in Divisa,1 more and more cases of police violations have been brought to light. Of these, 38 cases are well known, though there have been other cases that were never reported or were settled in private as the victim chose to remain anonymous. In all cases, the victims and their families have been supported by a network of legal professionals and activists, as well as at least a part of broader public opinion. The cases have sparked a movement aimed at bringing justice in each specific case but also at raising the level of awareness in society and within the police so that similar abuses can be prevented in the future.","AI","University of Winchester"

It identifies a number of key trends in consumer behavior and manners in which the medium is evolving.  The argument progresses to examine and challenge predominant conceptualisations of the buyer behaviour process and considers how these have been recast in the advent of digital technologies.  This provides the backdrop to develop a novel diagrammatic representation of digital marketing buyer behaviour processes which can be tested empirically.  The model is illustrated through the use of a vignette which points up the complexities which the model aims to represent.  The paper concludes with an appeal for the continued development, modelling and empirical testing of the evolving world of digital buyer behaviour.","AI","University of Winchester"

The findings of the study formed part of doctorate thesis and enabled further continuous professional development activities to be carried out. The case study focused on the use of symbolic gesturing, more commonly known as baby signing. Three practitioners, with varying expertise, journeys introducing and implementing symbol gesturing were documented during a three-month period, using a biographical research approach. The focus was on emotional interactions and whether symbolic gesturing could be an approach employed as way of responding to infants beyond verbal communication that had a shared meaning, infants could observe and understand. The aim was also for infants, as they became familiar with the signs, to also be able to initiate their own requests and emotions using signs alongside vocalisations. The case study concluded that symbolic gesturing was considered a mode of communication pre-verbal infants could engage in, building capacity for voice. ","AI","University of Winchester"
"Evaluation of implementation of fasting guidelines for enterally fed critical care patients","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/evaluation-of-implementation-of-fasting-guidelines-for-enterally-","","1 Feb 2019","Background & aims: Critically ill adults have increased nutrition risk. Prior to procedures patients are often fasted, leading to nutritional deficits. The use of fasting guidelines may therefore help reduce deficits from accumulating. The aim of this work was to determine the impact on nutrition support delivery following the implementation of fasting guidelines in addition to characterizing staff knowledge of the guidelines. Design: Retrospective data were collected on n = 74 patients at two different time points; prior to launch of fasting guidelines and post launch, with regards to estimated nutritional requirements, nutritional targets, volume of enteral nutrition (EN) delivered and periods of fasting. Clinical variables of interest were collected for up to 14 days. Questionnaires assessing staff knowledge/barriers to usage of the fasting guidelines were administered to ICU staff. Setting: 3 ICUs (General, Cardiac and Neurosciences) within University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. Patients: Mechanically ventilated adults in an ICU and receiving exclusive EN. Measurements and main results: Comparison was made between pre- and post-guideline implementation with statistically significant improvements in the % EN delivered (76.4 ± 11.8 vs. 84.1 ± 10.8 (p = 0.0009)) and duration of feeds withheld (41.5 ± 26.6 vs. 27.6 ± 20.8 h (p = 0.02)). There were non-significant improvements pre- and post-implementation in the % of energy and protein delivered (80.7 ± 16.4 vs. 86.5 ± 17.3 (p = 0.15 (NS)); 74 ± 18.3 vs. 79 ± 18.5 (p = 0.15 (NS))). 77% of staff were familiar with the guidelines, whilst 42% requested further education. The main barriers to guideline compliance were delays and unpredictable timing of procedures, and differing guidance from senior staff and non-ICU teams. Conclusions: Implementation of fasting guidelines led to significant improvements in EN delivery and reduced duration of feed breaks. The use of fasting guidelines is a positive step towards increasing nutrition delivery in the ICU. Further staff education and better planning around procedures is required to promote further adherence to the fasting guidelines.","AI","University of Winchester"

Morgan explores the vulnerability of the human condition in relation to the threat of totalitarianism to argue that the educational essence of Arendt’s political thought is rooted in her desire to move against totality and its consequences wherever and whenever its threat arises.  Through a consideration of the curriculum focused understandings of ‘Holocaust education’ that have recently developed in the UK, Morgan encompasses themes such as natality, responsibility, authority and renewal to retrieve an understanding of ‘Holocaust education’ in Arendt.  Morgan’s aim is to demonstrate the educational import of Arendt’s political thought for teachers and intending teachers who, according to Arendt, must assume responsibility for representing the inherited world, ruptured and characterised by the travesties of totalitarian regimes, accurately, meaningfully and educationally to those in their charge.

Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of ‘the zone’, a stage of creative practice often interpreted as an immersion in some form of silence, has been fundamental to my evolution as a writer of fiction, and as a teacher of both literacy and creative writing. This contribution will explore techniques for embedding intentional silence methodologies intoteaching literacy-based subjects, nurturing arts-based approaches to learning. Through such teaching the process of silence can make quantifiable differences at all levels of education. Focused silence offers an aid to imagination, to creative thinking, and to problem solving. Through silence learners engage with more than the tangible task; deepening the silence experience engages emotion and whole-body awareness, opening potential for widening benefits related to ownership of ideas, confidence, and motivation – all current issues within teaching and learning. When learners engage with silence, it gives voice to their inner introvert. Learners hear themselves think, and know, through connection with that quieter voice, they have something valuable to say.","AI","University of Winchester"

Resulting themes were divided into the processes and factors influencing athletes and how the athletes are affected. The athletes considered these themes effective because the coach had built an environment of trust and respect. How coaches might influence athletes were divided into cognitive influences and behavioral influences. The results are discussed in light of current sport coaching literature, and the way vignettes enhance the richness of the data collection is reflected on. Practically, the results suggest that S&C coaches can build trust and respect to influence athletes’ development through effective instruction, communication, and motivation.","AI","University of Winchester"

Many existing online maps do not follow this principle, but move a clicked point to the centre of the subsequent display, leaving the user looking at an unrelated location. This paper presents three experiments showing that collocating the point clicked on a map so that the detailed location appears in the place previously occupied by the overview location makes the map easier to use, reducing eye movements and interaction duration. We discuss the benefit of basing design principles on theoretical models so that they can be applied to novel situations, and so designers can infer when to use and not use them.","AI","University of Winchester"

These measures are typically determined using a contact-based pulse oximeter. This approach may pose difficulties in many cases, such as with young children, patients with burnt or sensitive skin, cognitive impairments, and those undergoing certain medical procedures or severe illnesses. Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) allows for unobtrusive sensing of these vital signs in a variety of settings for health monitoring systems. Several research studies have been conducted to use rPPG for this purpose; however, there is still not a commercially available, clinically validated system that overcomes the concerns highlighted in this paper. We present a state-of-the-art review of rPPG-related research conducted including related processes and techniques, such as regions of interest (ROI) selection, extracting the raw signal, pre-processing data, applying noise reduction algorithms, Fast Fourier transforms (FFT), filtering and extracting these vital signs. Further, we present a detailed, critical evaluation of available rPPG systems. Limitations and future directions have also been identified to aid rPPG researchers in further advancing this field.","AI","University of Winchester"

The research reveals the important role played by families in transmitting knowledge, memories, traditions and other cultural practices to diaspora children. Destination Marketing Organisations (DMOs), however, are neglecting to engage this lucrative market partly because communication strategies are aimed at adults of the diaspora and not at children. Based on these findings, we propose DMOs take a child-centred approach by actively engaging diaspora children to devise tourism marketing strategies that are child-friendly.","AI","University of Winchester"
"The Effectiveness of Different Visual Skills Training Programmes on Elite Cricket Players","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/the-effectiveness-of-different-visual-skills-training-programmes-","Sowden, P.","Dec 2018","The effectiveness of visual training interventions for athletes has been questioned over the last few years. Few studies have shown the potential for generic visual skills to improve visual performance in the sport while mostinterventions seem to be unsuccessful. There is a paucity of studies involving elite performers exposed to visual training programmes, which are becoming popular in the sporting domain. This study aimed to investigate the effectof visual training on visual and cricket skills compared to a control intervention. Twenty-four male county cricket players were pre- and post-tested on 14 visual and 7 cricket tasks. Participants were randomly divided into four groups and underwent a six-week visual training programme consisting of practical drills (P), online training (O), Nintendo Wii games (W), or a control intervention (C). Analysis showed all experimental groups significantly improved from pre- to post-test, whereas the C group showed no significant improvement. The three vision training methods implemented were able to improve visual and cricket skills more than being exposed only to a control intervention. This supports suggestions that visual skills can improve through training. The improvement in cricket skills observed in this study suggests that improvements in visual skills might influence ‘on-field’ improvements in performance.","AI","University of Winchester"

"Oesophageal cancer: The effect of early nutrition support on clinical outcomes","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/oesophageal-cancer-the-effect-of-early-nutrition-support-on-clini","","24 Feb 2021","Background and aims: Malnutrition is prevalent in oesophageal cancer. Evidence for the use of nutrition support and prehabilitation in this cohort is variable. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of early nutrition support and functional measures of nutritional status on post-operative outcomes in adult patients with oesophageal cancer.  Methods: Retrospective review of adults with oesophageal cancer undergoing oesophagectomy (n = 151). Early nutrition support was defined as: oral or enteral nutrition supplementation during neoadjuvant treatment. Late nutrition support defined as: oral or enteral nutrition supplementation prescribed post-operatively. Nutrition outcome measures were; percentage weight loss from 3 to 6 months prior to diagnosis, peri- and post-operatively, and pre-operative assessment of handgrip-strength (HGS).  Results: Pre-operative weight loss ≥10% was a significant predictor of mortality at 1 year (OR 2.84, 95%CI 1.03-7.83, p = 0.04) independent of tumour stage, adjuvant treatment, age and gender. Adults prescribed early nutrition support during neoadjuvant treatment experienced less weight loss at 12-months post-oesophagectomy compared to adults prescribed late oral nutrition support (p=<0.05). Pre-operative HGS measurements were not a useful predictor of postoperative complications (p = 0.2), length of stay (p = 0.9) or 90-day mortality (p = 0.6).  Conclusions: Pre-operative weight loss ≥10% was associated with mortality. Early nutrition support was associated with less weight loss at 12-months post-operatively. Pre-operative HGS measures did not have prognostic value as a stand-alone measure. Future work should investigate the efficacy of early nutrition support in reducing both pre- and post-operative weight loss to improve nutritional status and surgical outcomes as part of a multimodal prehabilitation programme in adults with oesophageal cancer.","AI","University of Winchester"

The aim of this review was to identify and critically appraise the results of published studies on the etiology and pathophysiology of IAD and highlight the current gaps in empirical evidence.Methods: Scoping literature review.Search strategy: The electronic databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for relevant articles published from 1996 to April 2018. Thirteen studies and review articles related to the etiology and pathophysiology of IAD were identified in our initial review, and 3 studies published subsequent to our initial review were evaluated and included in our final review.Findings: These studies suggest that several etiologic factors contribute to the development of IAD including exposure to urine, stool, or a combination of these substances (dual incontinence), the duration and frequency of exposure, frequent cleaning, and inflammatory responses. Results from the current scoping review showed that despite the increasing interest in IAD, evidence related to the underlying mechanisms causing IAD remains sparse. This paucity represents a clear gap in knowledge and indicates a need for additional research.Implications: Future studies should aim at elucidating: (1) the role of urine and its inherent pH on skin integrity, (2) the role of stool, specific digestive enzymes, and fecal bacteria on skin integrity, (3) the permeability and susceptibility of the skin to damage following frequent cleansing activities and occlusion, and (4) the specific inflammatory response triggered following exposure to urine and fecal matter.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Emergent practices of an environmental standard","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/emergent-practices-of-an-environmental-standard-3","Ozaki, R.","3 Jul 2015","Recent climate change statistics attribute over a quarter of carbon emissions to residential energy use in the United Kingdom. To address this, a building standard (Code for Sustainable Homes) was introduced to aim to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption. This paper analyzes how such an environmental standard reconfigures the sociotechnological relations and practices of housing professionals that design, construct, and manage social housing. We focus on how actors engage with the standard’s recommendation for incorporating low and zero carbon technologies into new buildings. We identify diverse practices that emerge from these engagements, which, we contend, have significant consequences for the working relationships of professional actors and for renewable energy provision. By being entwined in, and generative of actors’ practices, we argue that the Code becomes part of the sociotechnological relationships and infrastructures that shape energy provision.","AI","University of Winchester"

Participants were eight elite male rugby coaches purposefully sampled for this study. Participants were interviewed individually to gain an understanding of their experiences and perceptions of the role of the captain. The data were thematically analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Ten super-ordinate themes emerged in the study: types of captain, captain development, challenges, captains role, off field responsibilities, nature of the job, selection, cultural architects, coach-captain relationship, and key attributes. Results suggest coaches view the captain as an extension of their authority in the team, leadership groups are increasingly important to support captains, and that the criteria for the selection of captains is still vague. As a result, future research should explore the development of specific evidence-based approaches to captain selection and development.","AI","University of Winchester"

We begin by outlining some underlying values and assumptions of this model. We then elaborate how our research on political attitudes in post-apartheid South Africa has led us to question, qualify and sometimes reject those assumptions and move towards a ‘contextualist’ perspective on the efficacy of different models of social change. We agree that the project of getting us to like one another may be crucial for producing change in some contexts. In other contexts, however, it is an epiphenomenon that distracts psychologists from the main causes of, and solutions to, problems such as race, class, or gender discrimination. In still others, with an irony that is evidenced increasingly by research, prejudice reduction may actually contribute to the very problem it is designed to resolve. That is, it may diminish the extent to which social injustice is acknowledged, rejected and challenged.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Proposed Framework for the Management of Resorts Mini Clubs: An Ambidextrous Approach","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/proposed-framework-for-the-management-of-resorts-mini-clubs-an-am","","21 Feb 2019","Drawing on ambidextrous approaches to management, this study has found that Mini Clubs, whilst predominantly adopting an exploitative approach, need to redesign their services to enhance children’s experiences but also to contribute to the resorts’ competitive edge. The study suggests that a two-step strategy needs to be implemented by leisure organisations, namely an increased complexity strategy and an increased divergence strategy, which would make a strategic shift to a more exploratory approach and therefore ambidextrous management and marketing practices. Management initiatives are proposed and discussed in relation to key global trends influencing the leisure and hospitality sector. The paper represents the first endeavour to examine the management of resort Mini Clubs, proposes to fill a gap in the literature aimed to recognise the increasing role of children activities in the leisure and hospitality sector, and contributes to the study of ambidextrous management in leisure research.","AI","University of Winchester"

Over a one-year period 31 hospital 'trust-attached GP registrar' or 'TAG' posts were designed and piloted as an alternative to the traditional hospital-based model of training. This paper describes and evaluates the first six-month cohort of 18 posts. All posts were found to have achieved their aim of increased contact with primary care and outpatients for GP SHOs. In addition, there was an increase in teaching relevant to general practice, and when trainee satisfaction scores were compared with those of existing, 'traditional' posts, they were found to be higher. In conclusion, the trust-attached GP registrar (TAG) posts have been found to be an improvement on traditional GP vocational training SHO posts, and this type of innovative training post is now widely offered throughout Severn and Wessex.","AI","University of Winchester"
"""Spanish 'Colonies': A Term Forged in the Hispanic-Anglosphere""","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/spanish-colonies-a-term-forged-in-the-hispanic-anglosphere","Iglesias Rogers, G.","26 Apr 2021","The legal codes of the Spanish Monarchy never employed the term ‘colonias’ (colonies) to refer to its overseas dominions. This absence from the Spanish juridical lexicon had political implications highlighted by the decree of 22 January 1809 which famously stated that the American dominions were neither ‘colonies nor feitorias, but an essential and integral part of the Spanish Monarchy’. The aim of this chapter is not to revive the controversy sparked in the 1940s by Ricardo Levene’s campaign to remove the term ‘colonial’ from Hispanic historiography, but rather to trace the way and establish the extent to which the word ‘colonies’ came to be applied to the Hispanic context through increased entanglement with the British and Irish world. The chapter concentrates on the particular case of Ireland, where the American Revolution had revived protracted disputes about its own ‘colonial’ status and designation, and explores some of the formulations of the Hispanic world produced by Irish commentators between the end of the eighteenth century and the first two decades of the nineteenth. It also offers a glimpse into a one-size-fits-all understanding of how global polities operated that was prevalent at the time in Britain and Ireland.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Skill Acquisition and Development Issues with Predictable Badminton Feeding Routines","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/skill-acquisition-and-development-issues-with-predictable-badmint","Smith, S.","25 Feb 2022","Badminton practice designs contain feeding routines that allow players to practice technical skills. Optimal skill acquisition and development is gained through practice simulating competitive match play rather than approaches centred around mass repetition with low levels of uncertainty. This study aimed to evaluate the biomechanical differences in twelve youth elite UK badminton players in activities with varying levels of predictability. The three experimental trials were handfeed, multifeed and match play trials. Motion capture cameras were used to record participant biomechanical data. Data analysis revealed several significant biomechanical differences between trials. Results showed that an increase in trial unpredictability led to increased depth of the forward lunge shot and a lower racket shuttlecock strike position with greater forward trunk bend. This study showed that visual search behaviour in badminton is a key component of the forward lunge shot. Predictable practice feeding routines may cause poor skill acquisition and development through maladaptive learning behaviours. Coaches are recommended to implement unpredictable feeding practice routines to simulate the visual search behaviour of competitive badminton match play to enhance skill acquisition and development in youth elite badminton players.","AI","University of Winchester"

Drawing upon Critical Theory, this paper aims to explore and understand pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) school-based experience of learning and teaching in primary PE. A total of 625 PSTs took part in the study, representing a variety of routes into primary teaching. Quantitative data were obtained, identifying the number of lessons taught by PSTs, and their perceived confidence and willingness to teach. Qualitative data were also gathered to examine the contextual factors influencing PSTs’ development. Findings showed that while PSTs were both willing and confident to teach primary PE, over a third were unable to do so. Reasons were predominantly attributed to curriculum outsourcing and perceived low subject priority in initial teacher education.","AI","University of Winchester"

As municipal secondary schools for girls developed in England in the wake of the 1902 Education Act, and girls' grammar schools flourished in the wake of the 1944 Act, new buildings were increasingly provided. The newer state-maintained schools drew on longer-standing patterns in the siting of girls' schools related to both gender and class, which saw schools sited in former stately homes, around rail and bus networks, and in 'healthy' locations. The paper analyses entries in the Girls' School Yearbook from 1906 to 1995, to demonstrate the 'healthy' siting of many girls' schools on the brow of a hill. Well into the second half of the twentieth century, the height of a school's position above sea level and the type of soil on which the school was built were frequently cited as significant features, taking pride of place before the aims of the school, its curriculum, examination and admission policy. For many state-educated girls today, longstanding Victorian and Edwardian concerns that girls' education was detrimental to health have a legacy in a trudge up hills in all weathers as the prelude to a day's academic work at school.","AI","University of Winchester"

Most of the works discussed in this article have one underlying theme: the relationship between France and Italy and the Holocaust. This is inflected in a series of conceptual couples, such as guilt and innocence, collaboration and resistance, rescue and callousness, the state and the people. In other words, many of the works discussed here talk about the Holocaust but are really about France and Italy and, whilst set in the not-so-distant past, refer to notions of national identity (French-ness and Italian-ness) in the present. However, there is one major difference between the two countries. Whilst France shows some form of synergy between historiographical debate and television divulgation leading to what I define as a ‘nuanced’ trend, in which French responsibility for the persecution and deportation of Jews is acknowledged, for example in 93, rue Lauriston, Hôtel du Parc and recently Un village français, little of all this emerges from an analysis of Italian TV Holocaust-related narratives. In fact, the opposite trend is at work: the main development is the rise of a pernicious revisionism aimed at levelling differences between fascism and antifascism, and at presenting all sections of the Italian State as substantially innocent vis-à-vis the Holocaust. As a result, Italy’s Holocaust discourse as presented in the popular medium of television casts the country apart from its Western partners.","AI","University of Winchester"

This study explores sleep quality in older adolescents; specifically, whether insomnia constructs have unique patterns of association to depression, anxiety and stress. Data from 16-19-year old’s (n=198) recruited from further education colleges were obtained. Sleep quality was assessed using the diagnostic criteria for insomnia (DSM-5), Insomnia Severity Index and self-report. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to measure mental health state. A large proportion (42-52%) reported sleep difficulties lasting four weeks or more, with 17% short-sleepers (<7hrs.).  Regression analysis indicated 12.1%-17.8% of variance in mental health was explained by sleep quality. Specifically, “non-restorative sleep” and “daily impact” consistently predicted depression, anxiety and stress levels. Interestingly, “maintaining sleep” and “early wakings”, were associated with anxiety and stress respectively. Results indicate for a potentially large group of adolescents; sleep quality is poor. The cumulative effect of poor sleep appears particularly detrimental. Results provide preliminary indications that sleep behaviours could provide a means for early identification of mental health concerns. Findings can inform tailored interventions aimed at improving sleep quality in adolescents thereby having clear benefits in relation to both short, and longer term, health outcomes.","AI","University of Winchester"

It will do this by explicating my lived experience of learning and teaching aspects of a Cunningham-based approach to dance practice.  A central question of my research is how a sense of messiness contributes to enable ‘kinaesthetic unpredictability’ in the lived experience of performing Cunningham’s precise and predetermined dance phrases.  To define my ‘sense of messiness’ I will use choreological methods and improvisational frames to argue that a somatic sensation of messiness arises in various ways in the body/mind, produced in the act of dancing multiple and fragmented relationalities.  The article will question the value of exploring a lived experience of Cunningham’s fixed forms and examine how messiness and unpredictability can free up dancers to find individual innovations.   The discussion draws on voices of Cunningham dancers and teachers.  I will share my own pedagogic approach to expanding a lived experience, encouraging different ways of knowing and experimentation with potential relationalities.   The article aims to extend debates about dance training today including the use of codified forms and somatic approaches, principles of legacy techniques, and synthesising and innovating ways of knowing.

However, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities (LGBT+) face extra barriers and challenges to engagement and participation in sport. This study, formed through a partnership between Western Sydney University and Cricket Victoria, aimed to better understand how LGBT+ supporter/ coterie groups could be initiated and supported in the Big Bash League. Twenty-Four key stakeholders and informants drawn from Australian Football League (AFL) LGBT+ supporter groups, AFL administrators, cricket administrators, and LGBT+ cricket fans were interviewed to collect comprehensive data on the requirements for successful LGBT+ supporter group formation in cricket and the Big Bash League. Our results reveal a strong desire to include more LGBT+ communities in cricket, with the Big Bash League identified as an ideal opportunity due to its family-oriented nature. However, it was felt by participants that there was a lack of understanding and education of LGBT+-related issues within the cricket community. The experiences of those involved in AFL support groups have been overwhelmingly positive and provide a compelling case for the introduction of LGBT+ supporter groups in cricket, from both a social inclusion and financial management perspective. We conclude that the introduction of LGBT+ supporter groups in cricket has the potential to impact positively the lives of LGBT+ communities, providing a platform for them to engage with sport in a meaningful and positive way.","AI","University of Winchester"

Yet planning for this expectation is challenging: tranquility is a nebulous and highly subjective concept, resulting in multiple, often unique interpretations.  Adapting research first conducted in Dorset, south England, this study reports on how visitors to two protected areas in Yorkshire, north England, perceive tranquillity. Two hundred and forty research participants were engaged at six survey sites over several weeks.  Distinctions amongst the views are determined by age and gender. Sketch map data was combined in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to produce detailed maps of tranquillity across North York Moors National Park and Howardian Hills AONB.  Survey location and key interests appear to influence visitor perspectives on both tranquillity and non-tranquillity.

It argues that scholarly writing diminished the importance of embodied and situated aspects of human ‘knowledge’ within mainstream university art school courses, such as visual and performative arts. In the traditional book-centred disciplines, scholarly writing was useful for encoding declarative knowledge (e.g. ‘knowing that’) but is less effective for the kinds of procedural knowledge (e.g. ‘knowing how’) that are vital in creative, studio-/practice-based learning. Now that academic writing is aided by technologies offering automatic spelling and grammar checks, global text search, cut-and-paste this has further widened the gaps between the knowledges pertaining to head, heart and hand. Soon, however, the combined benefits of 5G, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and ambisonic technologies look likely to make ‘immersive’ and ‘experiential’ technologies almost ubiquitous. Given the appropriate research and development, the ‘metaverse’ could encourage students to think in ways that are more presently situated, relational, embodied and multidimensional.","AI","University of Winchester"
"The critical potential of somatic collectivity under Post-Fordism","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/the-critical-potential-of-somatic-collectivity-under-post-fordism","Colin, N.","1 Dec 2018","In this article, I refer to somatics as an umbrella term to discuss practices related to the dance field including protests, walks, flashmobs and choreographic explorations of performative participation. While these practices might not be widely recognized as somatic practices, I argue that all operate at a somatic level and point to an ever-shifting relationship between the individual, the collective and the social environment. I reflect on a number of theoretical ideas pertaining to the relations between the development of somatics and the intensification of cultural capitalism in contemporary western society. In doing so, I aim to theorize somatics as critical and political practices of collective forms of being and working together. Drawing on instances of collective embodiment, I argue for the politicization of somatic practices as it relates to ideas of affect, ethics and time. I suggest that embodied expressions of collectivity as politicized somatics can develop valid tactics to counter what I observe to be a mimetic phenomenon between dance practices and capitalism. I propose the concept of somatic collectivity as a way to describe the critical potential of collective embodiment found in dance and its expanded field of practices.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Training and Teaching in the Historic Environment","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/training-and-teaching-in-the-historic-environment-3","Everill, P.; Finneran, N.","25 Nov 2015","On 19 June 2012, the University of Winchester’s Centre for Applied Archaeology and Heritage Management, in association with Dr Kenneth Aitchison under the aegis of Landward Research, hosted a one-day conference entitled ‘21st Century Archaeologists: Teaching, Training and Professional Development’. The conference was provoked by a need to examine the effectiveness of current archaeological training, and to consider recent developments and initiatives in this field. In 2008 the Archaeology Training Forum had expressed its concern at ‘an ongoing level of disconnect between the expectations of archaeological employers, employees, training providers and students of archaeology in terms of the objectives of training and its outcomes’.1 There was a general widespread feeling across the sector that there was no coherent overview of the differing schemes and approaches to training. This conference sought to investigate these ideas, and to interrogate differing approaches to pedagogy and andragogy.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Intertrigo: Causes, prevention and management","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/intertrigo-causes-prevention-and-management","Voegeli, D.","25 Jun 2020","Intertrigo, also known as intertriginous dermatitis, is one of the four separate conditions that fall under the umbrella term of moisture-associated skin damage (MASD). It can affect individuals of all ages. Intertrigo is a common inflammatory skin disorder caused by skin-on-skin friction within skin folds, as a result of moisture becoming trapped because of poor air circulation. It can occur in any area of the body where two skin surfaces are in close contact with each other, such as the axillary, inframammary, umbilical and inguinal areas, and is strongly associated with obesity. Consensus clinical expert opinion suggests that investment in the development and adoption of clear skin care and skin fold management protocols can lead to improvements in the patient experience and better clinical outcomes.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Consumer ethical judgement and controversial advertising avoidance on social media.","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/consumer-ethical-judgement-and-controversial-advertising-avoidanc-3","","26 Jul 2016","Controversial advertising can be defined as advertising that offends or shocks viewers (Dahl et al. 2003). While some research on the ethical issues linked to controversial advertising offline can be found (Drumwright and Murphy 2009; Fam and Waller 2003), more research is needed on controversial advertising online and whether it may lead to ad avoidance on specific platforms, such as social media. This topic is important for marketers and researchers, given that the proliferation of social media advertising is driving brands to produce adverts which attempt to cut through the ad clutter with the use of controversial appeals (Dahl et al. 2003; Drumwright and Murphy 2009; Fam and Waller 2003; Waller 2005). Thus, this study aims to address this research gap and its objective is to examine the impact of controversial ad perception and consumer ethical judgment on ad avoidance, in the specific context of social media.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Embodying Ubuntu: Staying Alive Is a Co-Creative Performance","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/embodying-ubuntu-staying-alive-is-a-co-creative-performance","Taiwo, O.","9 Jun 2022","In Southern African cultures, the word ‘Ubuntu’ has come to mean, in the words of the Christian African philosopher J. S. Mbiti, ‘I am because we are; since we are therefore I am’. This chapter will refer to today’s largely cerebral education that principally feeds an anthropomorphic culture. I aim to offer a more self-reflexive and embodied framework for learning that embodies the existential autopoietic processes of Ubuntu. Future metadesigners could assist design thinking by rethinking their traditional emphasis on products, services and objects that disregards the semiotics of the Ecocene. They could instead consider a more relations-based idea of embodied-wisdom that is sensitized to eco semiotics. This process of oscillating reciprocity applies to my idea of the Return beat, which is derived from a pan-African metaphysical experience pertaining to a rhythmic aesthetic sensibility. I will use this circular perception of reciprocal rhythm to exemplify a more holistic approach to learning and design thinking.","AI","University of Winchester"
"Authority, Space and Gender in the Anglo-Norman Worlds, c. 900-c. 1200","https://winchester.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/authority-space-and-gender-in-the-anglo-norman-worlds-c-900-c-120","Weikert, K.","2020","Medieval manors have long been the subject of academic study, though the ways in which these houses reflected and shaped - and were shaped by - their occupants to express social authority have not yet been fully explored. This book undertakes a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary examination of them, aiming to provide a fuller account of how concepts of space and domestic place were understood, represented, and used by their occupants in England and Normandy from c. 900 to c. 1200, and how this illuminates aspects of gender and authority in the period. Blending approaches from archaeology and history, it uses evidence from Anglo-Saxon wills, standing and excavated manorial sites in England and Normandy, and a variety of written texts from vitae to history to poetry, in order to delve into, deconstruct and reconstruct gendered notions of authority in the period. This book ultimately challenges ideas of gendered objects and places through the medieval construction of authoritative personae, and the use and representation of medieval manors, focusing on the household as a place and space of performance in the age of the Norman Conquest.","AI","University of Winchester"
