"Enhanced network inference from sparse incomplete time series through automatically adapted  L1 regularization","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489694/","Zhongqi Cai; Enrico Gerding; Markus Brede","22 April 2024","Reconstructing dynamics of complex systems from sparse, incomplete time series data is a challenging problem with applications in various domains. Here, we develop an iterative heuristic method to infer the underlying network structure and parameters governed by Ising dynamics from incomplete spin configurations based on sparse and small-sized samples. Our method iterates between imputing missing spin states given current coupling strengths and re-estimating couplings from completed spin state data. Central to our approach is the novel application of adaptive l1regularization on updating coupling strengths, which features an automatic adjustment of the regularization strength throughout the iterative inference process. By doing so, we aim at preventing over-fitting and enforcing the sparsity of couplings without access to ground truth parameters. We demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers parameters and imputes missing spins even with substantial missing data and short time series, providing improvements in the inference of Ising model parameters even for relatively small sample sizes.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"A methodological review of randomised n-of-1 trials","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489294/","Olivia Hawkesworth; Robin Chatters; Steven Julious; Andrew Cook; Katie Biggs; Kiera Solariman; Michael C.H. Quah; Sxe Chang Cheong","6 April 2023","Background: n-of-1 trials are a type of crossover trial designed to optimise the evaluation of health technologies in individual patients. This trial design may be considered for the evaluation of health technologies in rare conditions where fewer patients are available to take part in research. This review describes the characteristics of randomised n-of-1 trials conducted over the span of 12 years, including how the n-of-1 design has been employed to study both rare and non-rare conditions.Methods: databases and clinical trials registries were searched for articles including “n-of-1” in the title between 2011 and 2023. The reference lists of reviews identified by the searches were searched for any additional eligible articles. Randomised n-of-1 trials were selected for inclusion and data were extracted on a range of design, population, and analysis characteristics. Descriptive statistics were produced for all variables.Results: we identified 74 studies meeting our eligibility criteria, 13 of which (17.6%) were conducted in rare condi- tions. They were conducted in a range of clinical areas with the most common being neurological conditions (n = 16, 21.6%). The median (Q1, Q3) number of participants randomised was 9 (4, 20) and 12 trials (16.2%) involved a single patient only. Forty-six (62.2%) trials evaluated pharmaceutical interventions and 49 (66.2%) trials were placebo con- trolled. Trials had a median (Q1, Q3) of six (4, 8) periods and 61 (82.4%) compared two health technologies. Fifty-seven (77.0%) trials incorporated blinding and 32 (43.2%) had a washout period. Forty-nine trials (66.2%) used patient- reported outcome measures (PROMs) to assess the primary outcome. Trials used a range of approaches to analysis and 48 (64.9%) combined data from multiple patients. The characteristics of the n-of-1 trials conducted in rare condi- tions were generally consistent with those in non-rare conditions.Conclusions: n-of-1 trials are still underused and the application of the n-of-1 design for the evaluation of health technologies for rare diseases has been particularly limited. We have summarised the characteristics of randomised n-of-1 trials in rare and non-rare conditions. We hope that it can inform researchers in the design of future n-of-1 stud- ies. Further work is required to provide guidance on specific design considerations, implementation, and statistical analysis of these studies.Trial registration: not applicable.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Innovation and foresight in SMEs: lessons from the case of U.K. digital health companies","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/486353/","Riccardo Vecchiato; Hang Do; Yannis Pierrakis; Robert Blackburn","11 November 2023","Technological innovation represents a significant opportunity for those organizations that are able to identify new technologies early and anticipate their future evolution and impact. At the same time, technological change is a key challenge, particularly for organizations that have limited resources for monitoring and developing emerging technologies and/or for transferring technologies from other industries/sectors. This is the case, in particular, for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The main objective of this article is to propose a new methodological approach to foresight that contributes to the literature on innovation management. This approach is tailored to SMEs and addresses the specific barriers they face in relation to foresight and innovation, e.g., limited access to information about new technologies and limited familiarity with advanced managerial practices. We illustrate our novel approach to foresight and innovation in SMEs and its application to a cluster of 16 SMEs of the London Digital Health Hub, and we discuss the main benefits and disadvantages of this approach. We contribute to the foresight and innovation literature by developing a methodological framework that is specifically designed for SMEs, rather than the adaptation or transfer of the dominant frameworks that have been previously designed for and applied in large organizations, corporate firms, and public institutions.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Predicting influenza-like illness trends based on sentinel surveillance data in China from 2011 to 2019: A modelling and comparative study             1","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490954/","Xingxing Zhang; Liuyang Yang; Teng Chen; Qing Wang; Jin Yang; Ting Zhang; Jiao Yang; Hongqing Zhao; Shengjie Lai; Luzhao Feng; Weizhong Yang","20 November 2023","Background: influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease with a significant global disease burden. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and its related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have introduced uncertainty to the spread of influenza. However, comparative studies on the performance of innovative models and approaches used for influenza prediction are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to predict the trend of influenza-like illness (ILI) in settings with diverse climate characteristics in China based on sentinel surveillance data using three approaches and evaluate and compare their predictive performance.Methods: the generalized additive model (GAM), deep learning hybrid model based on Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), and autoregressive moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARMA—GARCH) model were established to predict the trends of ILI 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week-ahead in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Hubei, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hainan, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in China, based on sentinel surveillance data from 2011 to 2019. Three relevant metrics, namely, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R squared, were calculated to evaluate and compare the goodness of fit and robustness of the three models.Results: considering the MAPE, RMSE, and R squared values, the ARMA—GARCH model performed best, while the GRU-based deep learning hybrid model exhibited moderate performance and GAM made predictions with the least accuracy in the eight settings in China. Additionally, the models’ predictive performance declined as the weeks ahead increased. Furthermore, blocked cross-validation indicated that all models were robust to changes in data and had low risks of overfitting.Conclusions: our study suggested that the ARMA—GARCH model exhibited the best accuracy in predicting ILI trends in China compared to the GAM and GRU-based deep learning hybrid model. Therefore, in the future, the ARMA—GARCH model may be used to predict ILI trends in public health practice across diverse climatic zones, thereby contributing to influenza control and prevention efforts.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Predictive models for photosynthetic active radiation irradiance in temperate climates","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490879/","Yazan J.K. Musleh; Tasmiat Rahman","20 May 2024","This research evaluated 10 different empirical models designed for predicting Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) at higher latitudes, addressing atmospheric conditions specific to these regions. The research introduces the Musleh-Rahman (MR) model, which substitutes Diffuse Horziontal Irradiance (DHI) with Clear Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Ozone and Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD550) sourced for satellite reanalysis data, achieving a Mean Bias Deviation (MBD) of 0.19 % and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.42 W/m2. Furthermore, when applied to six untested locations, results demonstrate that the MR model outperformed the best performing empirical model with an MBD improvement of 3.68 % and an RMSE of 4.28 W/m2, whereas, when compared to machine learning models, the Light Gradient Boost Model (LGBM), had an MBD of −3.85 %. The MR model also maintained consistency across seasonal and density evaluations, attaining an R2value as high as 0.9709, thereby highlighting the significant benefits of integrating satellite-sourced atmospheric data into PAR prediction models. Moreover, the research illustrated that substituting DHI with Clear DNI, Ozone, and AOD550 not only reduces MBD and boosts R2values but also amplifies the model's applicability and accuracy in capturing early PAR peaks and reducing overestimations through precise adjustments in Ozone and AOD550 levels. This highlights the benefits of incorporating satellite-derived atmospheric data into PAR predictions models.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Direct numerical simulation of a high-pressure hydrogen micromix combustor: flame structure and stabilisation mechanism","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/484393/","T.L. Howarth; M.A. Picciani; E.S. Richardson; M.S. Day; A.J. Aspden","9 September 2023","A high-pressure hydrogen micromix combustor has been investigated using direct numerical simulation with detailed chemistry to examine the flame structure and stabilisation mechanism. The configuration of the combustor was based on the design by Schefer et al. [1], using numerical periodicity to mimic a large square array. A precursor simulation of an opposed jet-in-crossflow was first conducted to generate appropriate partially-premixed inflow boundary conditions for the subsequent reacting simulation. The resulting flame can be described as an predominantly-lean inhomogeneously-premixed lifted jet flame. Five main zones were identified: a jet mixing region, a core flame, a peripheral flame, a recirculation zone, and combustion products. The core flame, situated over the jet mixing region, was found to burn as a thin reaction front, responsible for over 85% of the total fuel consumption. The peripheral flame shrouded the core flame, had low mean flow with high turbulence, and burned at very lean conditions (in the distributed burning regime). It was shown that turbulent premixed flame propagation was an order-of-magnitude too slow to stabilise the flame at these conditions. Stabilisation was identified to be due to ignition events resulting from turbulent mixing of fuel from the jet into mean recirculation of very lean hot products. Ignition events were found to correlate with shear-driven Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices, and increased in likelihood with streamwise distance. At the flame base, isolated events were observed, which developed into rapidly burning flame kernels that were blown downstream. Further downstream, near-simultaneous spatially-distributed ignition events were observed, which appeared more like ignition sheets. The paper concludes with a broader discussion that considers generalising from the conditions considered here.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Improving predictions of critical shear stress in gravel bed rivers: Identifying the onset of sediment transport and quantifying sediment structure","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489415/","Rebecca A. Hodge; Hal E. Voepel; Elowyn M. Yager","25 March 2024","Understanding when gravel moves in river beds is essential for a range of different applications but is still surprisingly hard to predict. Here we consider how our ability to predict critical shear stress (τc) is being improved by recent advances in two areas: (1) identifying the onset of bedload transport; and (2) quantifying grain-scale gravel bed structure. This paper addresses these areas through both an in-depth review and a comparison of new datasets of gravel structure collected using three different methods. We focus on advances in these two areas because of the need to understand how the conditions for sediment entrainment vary spatially and temporally, and because spatial and temporal changes in grain-scale structure are likely to be a major driver of changes in τc. We use data collected from a small gravel-bed stream using direct field-based measurements, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is the first time that these methods have been directly compared. Using each method, we measure structure-relevant metrics including grain size distribution, grain protrusion and fine matrix content. We find that all three methods produce consistent measures of grain size, but that there is less agreement between measurements of grain protrusion and fine matrix content.","Tech","University of Southampton"

This study presents an Event-B intervention timing pattern designed to include human drivers' responses when they act as fallback mechanisms in Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) systems. The proposed pattern outlines specific timings for driver interventions following alerts from SDVs, offering a clear set of expectations and conditions for human drivers during these critical takeover instances. The usability of this pattern is demonstrated through a case study, highlighting its importance for situations that require interventions. Ultimately, it sheds light on the operational aspects of SDVs, ensuring a safe and orderly transition from automated to manual control.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Reconfigurable massive MIMO: harnessing the power of the electromagnetic domain  for enhanced information transfer","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/475957/","Keke Ying; Zhen Gao; Sheng Chen; Xinyu Gao; Michail Matthaiou; Rui Zhang; Robert Schober","22 February 2023","The capacity of commercial massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems is constrained by the limited array aperture at the base station, and cannot meet the ever-increasing traffic demands of wireless networks. Given the array aperture, holographic MIMO with infinitesimal antenna spacing can maximize the capacity, but is physically unrealizable. As a promising alternative, reconfigurable mMIMO is proposed to harness the unexploited power of the electromagnetic (EM) domain for enhanced information transfer. Specifically, the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology provides each antenna with an adjustable EM radiation (EMR) pattern, introducing extra degrees of freedom for information transfer in the EM domain. In this article, we present the concept and benefits of availing the EMR domain for mMIMO transmission. Moreover, we propose a viable architecture for reconfigurable mMIMO systems, and the associated system model and downlink precoding are also discussed. In particular, a three-level precoding scheme is proposed, and simulation results verify its considerable spectral and energy efficiency advantages compared to traditional mMIMO systems. Finally, we further discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of deploying reconfigurable mMIMO, along with the associated hardware, algorithms, and fundamental theory.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Joint hybrid transceiver and reflection matrix design for RIS-aided mmWave MIMO cognitive radio systems","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491368/","Jitendra Singh; Suraj Srivastava; Surya P. Yadav; Aditya K. Jagannatham; Lajos Hanzo","12 June 2024","In this work, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) downlink operating in the underlay mode is investigated. The cognitive base station (CBS) communicates with multiple secondary users (SUs), each having multiple RF chains in the presence of a primary user (PU). We conceive a joint hybrid transmit precoder (TPC), receiver combiner (RC), and RIS reflection matrix (RM) design, which maximizes the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the secondary system while maintaining the interference induced at the PU below a specified threshold. To this end, we formulate the sum-SE maximization problem considering the total transmit power (TP), the interference power (IP), and the non-convex unity modulus constraints of the RF TPC, RF RC, and RM. To solve this highly non-convex problem, we propose a twostage hybrid transceiver design in conjunction with a novel block coordinate descent (BCD)-successive Riemannian conjugate gradient (SRCG) algorithm. We initially decompose the RF TPC, RC, and RM optimization problem into a series of subproblems and subsequently design pairs of RF TPC and RC vectors, followed by successively optimizing the elements of the RM using the iterative BCD-SRCG algorithm. Furthermore, based on the effective baseband (BB) channel, the BB TPC and BB RC are designed using the proposed direct singular value decomposition (D-SVD) and projection based SVD (P-SVD) methods. Subsequently, the proportional water-filling solution is proposed for optimizing the power, which maximizes the weighted sum-SE of the system. Finally, simulation results are provided to compare our proposed schemes to several benchmarks and quantify the impact of other parameters on the sum-SE of the system.","Tech","University of Southampton"

The transition comes out to be made of a well defined sequence of events, each of which corresponds to a specific clustered state. The network’s nodes involved in each of the clusters can be identified, and the value of the coupling strength at which the events are taking place can be approximately ascertained. Finally, we present large-scale simulations which show the accuracy of the approximation made, and of our predictions in describing the synchronization transition of both synthetic and real-world large size networks, and we even report that the observed sequence of clusters is preserved in heterogeneous networks made of slightly non-identical systems.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Shah; Nicola J. Harris; Paula J. Booth; Dietmar Hammerschmid; James C. Gumbart; Helen I. Zgurskaya; Eamonn Reading","10 June 2024","Tripartite resistance nodulation and cell division multidrug efflux pumps span the periplasm and are a major driver of multidrug resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. The periplasm provides a distinctenvironment between the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Cations, such as Mg2+, become concentrated within the periplasm and, in contrast to the cytoplasm, its pH is sensitive to conditions outside the cell. Here, we reveal an interplay between Mg2+ and pH in modulating the dynamics of the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, and its function within the prototypical AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump from Escherichia coli. In the absence of Mg2+, AcrA becomes increasingly plastic within acidic conditions, but when Mg2+ is bound this is ameliorated, resulting in domain specific organisation in neutral to weakly acidic regimes. We establish a unique histidine residue directs these structural dynamics and is essential for sustaining pump efflux activity across acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions. Overall, we propose Mg2+ conserves the structural mobility of AcrA to ensureoptimal AcrAB-TolC function within rapid changing environments commonly faced by the periplasmduring bacterial infection and colonization. This work highlights that Mg2+ is an important mechanistic component in this pump class and possibly across other periplasmic lipoproteins.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"MBFair: a model-based verification methodology for detecting violations of individual fairness","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491346/","Qusai Ramadan; Marco Konersmann; Amir Shayan Ahmadian; Jan Jürjens; Steffen Staab","28 April 2024","Decision-making systems are prone to discrimination against individuals with regard to protected characteristics such as gender and ethnicity. Detecting and explaining the discriminatory behavior of implemented software is difficult. To avoid the possibility of discrimination from the onset of software development, we propose a model-based methodology called MBFair that allows for verifying UML-based software designs with regard to individual fairness. The verification in MBFair is performed by generating temporal logic clauses, whose verification results enable reporting on the individual fairness of the targeted software. We study the applicability of MBFair using three case studies in real-world settings including a bank services system, a delivery system, and a loan system. We empirically evaluate the necessity of MBFair in a user study and compare it against a baseline scenario in which no modeling and tool support is offered. Our empirical evaluation indicates that analyzing the UML models manually produces unreliable results with a high chance of 46% that analysts overlook true-positive discrimination. We conclude that analysts require support for fairness-related analysis, such as our MBFair methodology.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Worsley; Davide Filingeri","8 May 2024","Female development includes significant morphological changes across the breast. Yet, whether differences in breast surface area (BrSA) modify sweat gland density and output remains unclear. The present study investigated the relationship between BrSA and sweat gland density and output in 22 young to middle-aged women (2810 years) of varying breast sizes (BrSA range: 147–561 cm2) during a submaximal run in a warm environment (320.6°C; 531.7% relative humidity). Local sweat gland density and local sweat rate (LSR) above and below the nipple and at the bra triangle were measured. Expired gases were monitored for the estimation of evaporative requirements for heat balance (Ereq, in W/m2). Associations between BrSA and (i) sweat gland density; (ii) LSR; and (iii) sweat output per gland for the breast sites were determined via correlation and regression analyses. Our results indicated that breast sweat gland density decreased linearly as BrSA increased (r = −0.76, P < 0.001), whereas sweat output per gland remained constant irrespective of BrSA (r = 0.29, P = 0.28). This resulted in LSR decreasing linearly as BrSA increased (r = −0.62, P = 0.01). Compared to the bra triangle, the breast had a 64% lower sweat gland density (P < 0.001), 83% lower LSR (P < 0.001) and 53% lower output per gland (P < 0.001). BrSA (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.015) explained a greater proportion of variance in LSR than Ereq (in W/m2) (R2 = 0.07, P = 0.538). These novel findings extend the known relationship between body morphology and sweat gland density and LSR, to the female breast. This knowledge could innovate user-centred design of sports bras by accommodating breast size-specific needs for sweat management, skin wetness perception and comfort.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Ntim","23 May 2024","This study examines the relationship between gender diversity and intellectual capital performance, and moderating role of family ownership on this relationship. The study used 3730 firm-year observations of 307 non-financial firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange over the period 2008-2020 and employed ordinary least squares regression analysis to test the hypotheses. More specifically, the study used Kanter’s (1977) framework of group composition (skewed board, tilted board, and balanced board) to examine multiple significance levels of gender diversity on boards, and used five measures (modified value-added intellectual coefficient, human capital efficiency, structural capital efficiency, relational capital efficiency, and capital employed efficiency) of intellectual capital performance. Using lens of agency theory and resource dependence theory, we found that gender diversity positively influences intellectual capital performance, however, the strongest impact is apparent in case of balanced board. Moreover, family ownership positively influences this relationship. Our study complements the efforts of policy makers by providing empirical support for the mandatory placement of females on boards and urge them to increase number of females on corporate boards to derive maximum benefits of female directors. In addition, our results recommend the enhancement of the professional skills of women work force to ensure their maximum participation in the corporate sector.","Tech","University of Southampton"

In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent advances in ISAC systems, with a particular focus on their foundations, physical-layer system design, networking aspects, and ISAC applications. Furthermore, we discuss the corresponding open questions of the above that emerged in each issue. Hence, we commence with the information theory of sensing and communications (S&C), followed by the information-Theoretic limits of ISAC systems by shedding light on the fundamental performance metrics. Next, we discuss their clock synchronization and phase offset problems, the associated Pareto-optimal signaling strategies, as well as the associated super-resolution physical-layer ISAC system design. Moreover, we envision that ISAC ushers in a paradigm shift for the future cellular networks relying on network sensing, transforming the classic cellular architecture, cross-layer resource management methods, and transmission protocols. In ISAC applications, we further highlight the security and privacy issues of wireless sensing. Finally, we close by studying the recent advances in a representative ISAC use case, namely, the multiobject-multitask (MOMT) recognition problem using wireless signals.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Wilcox; Nour Odeh; Tristan W. Clark","2 April 2024","INTRODUCTION: FebriDx® is a CE-marked, single-use point-of-care test with markers for bacterial [C-reactive protein (CRP)] and viral [myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA)] infection, using finger-prick blood samples. Results are available after 10-12 min. We explored the usability and potential impact of FebriDx® in reducing antibiotic prescriptions for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in primary care, and the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT).METHODS: Patients (aged ≥1 year) with LRTI deemed likely to receive antibiotic prescription were recruited at nine general practices and underwent FebriDx® testing. Data collection included FebriDx® results, antibiotic prescribing plan (before and after testing) and re-consultation rates. Staff completed System Usability Scale questionnaires.RESULTS: From 31 January 2023 to 9 June 2023, 162 participants participated (median age 57 years), with a median symptom duration of 7 days (IQR 5-14). A valid FebriDx® result was obtained in 97% (157/162). Of 155 patients with available results, 103 (66%) had no detectable CRP or MxA, 28 (18%) had CRP only, 5 (3%) had MxA only, and 19 (12%) had both CRP and MxA. The clinicians' stated management plan was to prescribe antibiotics for 86% (134/155) before testing and 45% (69/155) after testing, meaning a 41% (95% CI: 31%, 51%) difference after testing, without evidence of increased re-consultation rates. Ease-of-use questionnaires showed 'good' user-friendliness.CONCLUSIONS: Use of FebriDx® to guide antibiotic prescribing for LRTI in primary care was associated with a substantial reduction in prescribing intentions. These results support a fully powered RCT to confirm its impact and safety.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Our work marks a significant academic milestone with its dual contributions: an in- depth review of upgradeable smart contract patterns underpinned by OpenZeppelin, and the development and thorough evaluation of a novel Risk Model. We provide a comprehensive study focusing on the effectiveness of these upgradeable techniques, evaluating their merits of security, efficiency, and economy. The Risk Model, meanwhile, represents a robust predictive model to identify potential risks bound to upgradeable smart contracts. We have identified the risk based on several critical factors, including average block time, mempool’s average pending time, and the gas price proposed by the transaction caller. In conclusion, the way for significant improvements in our understanding of upgrade- able smart contracts, setting a robust foundation for future academic explorations and practical blockchain applications.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Social trust in property ownership: a study in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491441/","Manar Mousa M Altamimi","June 2024","Ownership refers to the legal rights, obligations, and interests, all of which are formally recognised by a legal system. The regulation of property ownership dictates access to and control over land and other resources. In modern society, property ownership relies heavily on technology for identifying, record-keeping, and verifying property ownership to ensure compliance with the legal system. However, this reliance on technology introduces challenges such as fraud, incorrect information, and potential challenges like double sales as technology continues to advance. Further challenges can be encountered when it is regulated by several governmental entities to secure ownership. This research focuses specifically on the legal system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, acknowledging the global nature of challenges but tailoring the investigation to the unique context of this region. To address the challenges inherent in the land registration system, the research proposes a STF. Unlike existing approaches that primarily lean on technology, this framework delves into the underlying factors contributing to challenges and identifies key considerations for establishing a safe process for transferring ownership. The framework encompasses four categories of social needs for trusting systems: organisation, provenance, technical, and legal. Each category comprises a set of factors that should be considered during the development of the system. Importantly, this framework is designed in alignment with the interests of stakeholders who regularly engage with the systems and is validated by experts in governmental entities. The validation process is based on qualitative data and analyse using thematic analysis. The STF supports the analysis of user requirement specifications to identify the necessary requirements. The user needs are analysed to identify the requirements needed using the scenario-based approach of transferring ownership, with the knowledge that this scenario avoids the challenges outlined. The identified requirements serve as essential inputs for constructing models using the Event-B formal methods, a mathematical approach that ensures the correctness and consistency of the requirements. The formal model is built using a correctness-by-construction methodology, that allows the deduction of assurances for the trustworthy process of transferring ownership. The model undergoes evaluation by formal method specialists to guarantee the construction of an accurate model through the utilisation of discount expert review. Applying the formal method significantly affects system development. It aids in articulating implicit assumptions and clarifying system requirements. They highlight challenges with system requirements, and their rigour helps to understand the challenge better. Additionally, the formal method reduces implementation time and error by a large amount.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry derived knee shape may provide a useful imaging biomarker for predicting total knee replacement: findings from a study of 37,843 people in UK Biobank","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489211/","Rhona A. Beynon; Fiona R. Saunders; Raja Ebsim; Monika Frysz; Benjamin Faber; Jennifer S. Gregory; Claudia Lindner; Aliya Sarmanova; Richard M. Aspden; Nicholas C. Harvey; Timothy Cootes; Jonathan H. Tobias","3 April 2024","Objective: we aimed to create an imaging biomarker for knee shape using knee dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and investigate its potential association with subsequent total knee replacement (TKR), independently of radiographic features of knee osteoarthritis and established risk factors.Methods: using a 129-point statistical shape model, knee shape (expressed as a B-score) and minimum joint space width (mJSW) of the medial joint compartment (binarized as above or below the first quartile) were derived. Osteophytes were manually graded in a subset of images and an overall score was assigned. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations of B-score, mJSW and osteophyte score with TKR risk, adjusting for age, sex, height and weight.Results: the analysis included 37,843 individuals (mean age 63.7 years). In adjusted models, B-score was associated with TKR: each unit increase in B-score, reflecting one standard deviation from the mean healthy shape, corresponded to a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.25 (2.08, 2.43), while a lower mJSW had a HR of 2.28 (1.88, 2.77). Among the 6719 images scored for osteophytes, mJSW was replaced by osteophyte score in the most strongly predictive model for TKR. In ROC analyses, a model combining B-score, osteophyte score, and demographics outperformed a model including demographics alone (AUC ​= ​0.87 vs 0.73).Conclusions: using statistical shape modelling, we derived a DXA-based imaging biomarker for knee shape that was associated with kOA progression. When combined with osteophytes and demographic data, this biomarker may help identify individuals at high risk of TKR, facilitating targeted interventions.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Deep reinforcement learning for online combinatorial resource allocation with arbitrary state and action spaces","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491435/","Tesfay Zemuy Gebrekidan","June 2024","Online combinatorial resource allocation is the process of dynamically assigning limited resources to tasks that arrive arbitrarily. The allocation of resources is done without complete knowledge of future resource demands. Conventional resource allocation algorithms, such as mathematical optimization, are inefficient for online resource allocation problems because relevant information about the problem is not available in advance; they cannot predict and adapt to the dynamic changes of the problem; they have high online computational costs, making them impractical for real-time decisions; and they are inefficient for non-convex optimization problems. Real-time optimization using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms is state-of-the-art in online resource allocation. The use of AI/ML is one of the key components in the evolution of 5G to 6G. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a subfield of ML that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning (DL), both of which are components of AI. Due to its ability to make sequential online decisions in dynamic and uncertain contexts, as well as its ability to learn from experience and lower online computational costs, DRL is a commonly used solution for online resource allocation problems. Compared to other application areas, DRL encounters unique challenges in online combinatorial resource allocation problems. The resource allocation problem often involves elements that are of varying sizes and have no specific order, henceforth referred to as arbitrarily sized and orderless (ASO) elements. In mobile and cloud computing, for example, the problem can include tasks with varying numbers and sizes, as well as varying numbers of user devices (UDs). However, existing DRL algorithms use standard deep neural network (DNN) algorithms as function approximators. The neurons in DNNs are set to accept specific information at the specific index of a given input, whereas the order of the tasks in the input of combinatorial resource allocation problems does not matter. The DNN cannot generalize using the knowledge it learned with a different permutation of the same input. Furthermore, the number of UDs can vary, but the number of neurons in the input of standard DNNs is fixed in size. Additionally, existing DRL algorithms make decisions by selecting a single action sequentially or a fixed number of actions at a time for the ASO input. However, online combinatorial resource allocation needs to select an arbitrary number of actions based on the resource constraint. This sequential action selection leads to increased dimensionality, suboptimal convergence in training, and greater computational complexity. Arbitrary action space, in particular, is understudied in DRL. Furthermore, existing DRL algorithms in resource allocation problems consider homogeneous constraints on either the UDs or the server side, while resource allocation problems usually include various resource constraints. There are continuous-valued resource constraints on UDs, discrete-valued number of channels on the communication network, and combinatorial competition of UDs on the server due to storage constraints. These challenges can generally be summarized as handling an arbitrary state space for an ASO input, an arbitrary action space for an ASO output, and various constraints on the UDs and the server. The objective of this research is to advance DRL algorithms for online combinatorial resource allocation problems so that they can effectively handle arbitrary state and action spaces for the ASO inputs and outputs, as well as to consider heterogeneous resource constraints on the UDs and the server. Consequently, we propose three solutions as follows. 1) A novel DRL algorithm with coalition action selection for online combinatorial resource allocation. The coalition action selection enables DRL to simultaneously select an arbitrary number of actions without updating the state multiple times. By reducing state space and depth of decision, coalition action selection provides better performance, faster convergence, and lower execution complexity compared to conventional sequential action selection approaches, where the state is updated for every action taken. 2) We proposed a novel DRL algorithm with computationally efficient stationary ASO input transformation for online combinatorial resource allocation problems. By using a set of equations to transform the ASO input to a fixed-size vector, the stationary ASO input transformation provides better convergence and lower computational cost than a transformer neural network-based transformation, which is used as the state-of-the-art technique to handle ASO inputs in existing combinatorial optimization problems. The reason for the efficiency is that the transformer is designed to learn contextual relationships between the sequence of words in natural language processing (NLP), but the ASO inputs in the resource allocation are numerical and do not have as significant a relationship as the sequence of words. 3) By applying coalition action selection to the multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), we propose a combinatorial client-master multiagent DRL (CCM_MADRL) algorithm for task offloading in mobile edge computing (CCM_MADRL_MEC) to handle various resource constraints. The efficiencies of the proposed solutions, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, are assessed using online resource allocation problems with arbitrary arrival of tasks and various resource constraints. The DRL algorithm with coalition action selection is evaluated using an online resource allocation problem with an arbitrary number of tasks. It has outperformed existing sequential action selection approaches in terms of proximity to offline optimal solutions, speed of convergence, and computational costs. The coalition action selection retains close to offline optimal performance in settings with different task arrival rates, whereas the sequential action selection approach drops in performance when the task arrival rate is high. The DRL with coalition action selection is implemented using the encoder of the transformer neural network. We evaluated the stationary ASO input transformation on the same problem. It has outperformed the transformer-based transformation in various sizes of task arrival rates. Furthermore, the stationary ASO input transformation yields a lower computational complexity than the transformer for various task arrival rates. The difference in computational cost between the transformer and the stationary ASO input transformation is greater in the sequential action selection than in the coalition action selection. Lastly, the CCM_MADRL algorithm is evaluated using a task-offloading problem in mobile edge computing with different constraints, such as battery level, task deadline, transmission power, computational resource, server storage capacity, and number of communication channels. By exploiting the different advantages of the policy iteration and value function and the coalition action selection approach, it has demonstrated better convergence than the existing MADDPG and heuristic algorithms.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"The affective geographies of human-pig relationships","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491431/","Kate Goldie","June 2024","This thesis delves into the diverse and often overlooked lives of pigs beyond traditional agricultural settings, exploring their relationships with humans across three alternative spaces of encounter; animal research facilities, homes, and animal rescue spaces.  Adopting a more-than-human geography perspective, this research is intrigued by the circulation, coexistence, and conflict of affect in human-pig relations. While animal geographies have made significant progress in understanding human-animal entanglements with space, place, and power, this thesis underscores the need for further investigation into the lived experiences of pigs and the nuanced nature of our connections with them. The research focuses on the transformative potential of love and care, advocating for new forms of political action by critically examining the boundary-making processes co-constitutive of human-pig entanglements. It introduces the concept of the ‘multiplicity of the pig’ to reflect the diverse roles and relationships that (re)define the pig and their identities. This concept acknowledges that pigs are not confined to a singular context or narrative, challenging their normative categorisation as ‘livestock’. Drawing on ethnographic data from animal research facilities, a pig sanctuary, and interviews with various participants including animal research technicians, pet pig keepers, sanctuary staff and volunteers, and a pet pig breeder, the thesis advances a more-than-human understanding of human-pig relationships. The inherently political relationships forged in the contexts explored in this thesis craft spaces for alternative encounters with pigs, representing practices of ‘worlding’ that reshape the boundaries of our shared worlds. This comprehensive understanding has the potential to drive ethical and political transformations, recognising that affective relations actively contribute to shaping shared multispecies experiences. However, the thesis identifies multiple challenges to worlding, entangled with species power relations that harbour hierarchical structures that seek to derail the transformative potential of affect.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"An application of artificial intelligence to a linear inverse problem in dipolar spectroscopy","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490747/","Jake Keeley","June 2024","Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) Spectroscopy plays a pivotal role in analysing molecular distances at the nanoscale, a crucial factor in understanding the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules. However, the challenge lies in extracting distance distributions from DEER data due to the inherently ill-conditioned nature of the inverse problem. Traditional solutions, such as regularisation, introduce bias through operator selection based on prior assumptions like smoothness.Recent applications of neural networks in this field provide a promising, data-driven alternative. Nevertheless, concerns regarding the perceived ’black box’ nature of these networks raise questions about their trustworthiness. Trust, though often nebulous, can be clarified by comparing it to the trust we place in human experts. Human experts are considered trustworthy when:1. They possess recognised expertise, demonstrated through a history of high-quality publications.2. They accurately assess and communicate their confidence level in their judgements, avoiding unwarranted overconfidence.3. They readily admit when a problem or question falls outside their area of expertise, avoiding speculation in unfamiliar domains.4. They effectively articulate their reasoning and thought process, ensuring transparency in their decision-making.Translating these criteria to neural networks yields explicit expectations:1. Demonstrated high predictive accuracy, validated through rigorous testing and consistent performance.2. The ability to quantify uncertainty in predictions.3. The capability to detect when a query falls outside its training distribution.4. An explainable decision-making process.This thesis delves into enhancing predictive accuracy in DEER spectroscopy by addressing the “vanishing gradient problem” in neural networks. It explores uncertainty quantification through ensemble techniques and out-of-distribution detection via model fitting. Lastly, it introduces “descrambling”, an innovative post-hoc explainability method based on equivalence transforms, aimed at elucidating the internal processes of the neural network.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Global real-world experiences with pembrolizumab in advanced urothelial carcinoma after platinum-based chemotherapy: the ARON-2 study","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489845/","Francesco Massari; Matteo Santoni; Hideki Takeshita","17 April 2024","Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed previous treatment paradigm of advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). The ARON-2 study (NCT05290038) aimed to assess the real-world effectiveness of pembrolizumab in patients recurred or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Medical records of patients with documented metastatic UC treated by pembrolizumab as second-line therapy were retrospectively collected from 88 institutions in 23 countries. Patients were assessed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR). Cox proportional hazards models were adopted to explore the presence of prognostic factors. Results: In total, 836 patients were included: 544 patients (65%) received pembrolizumab after progression to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (cohort A) and 292 (35%) after recurring within < 12 months since the completion of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cohort B). The median follow-up time was 15.3 months. The median OS and the ORR were 10.5 months and 31% in the overall study population, 9.1 months and 29% in cohort A and 14.6 months and 37% in cohort B. At multivariate analysis, ECOG-PS ≥ 2, bone metastases, liver metastases and pembrolizumab setting (cohort A vs B) proved to be significantly associated with worst OS and PFS. Stratified by the presence of 0, 1–2 or 3–4 prognostic factors, the median OS was 29.4, 12.5 and 4.1 months (p < 0.001), while the median PFS was 12.2, 6.4 and 2.8 months, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study confirms that pembrolizumab is effective in the advanced UC real-world context, showing outcome differences between patients recurred or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Quantifying metabolic reprogramming in the context of Natural Killer cell immunotherapy against Hepatocellular carcinoma using conventional and microscale NMR spectroscopy","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491332/","Genevieve Alice Rogers","June 2024","Metabolic reprogramming is at the core of cell functionality and fate. The ability to alter the use of metabolic pathways is observed both in the immune system and as a hallmark of cancer. This thesis demonstrates the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantify the aberrant metabolism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the metabolic reprogramming of natural killer (NK) cells. NK cell immunotherapies rely on activation by cytokines but can be hampered by the immunosuppresive environment of solid tumours such as HCC. Quantification of this effect is important in the development of immunotherapies against solid cancers as well as for understanding disease mechanisms. NK cells are known to undergo significant metabolic reprogramming in response to external stimuli in order to increase cytotoxic function. A similar phenomenon is observed in the aberrant metabolism of cancer cells that allows the utilisation of diverse sources of energy to support rapid growth and proliferation. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique that can be utilised in metabolomics for non-invasive quantification of multiple metabolites simultaneously from complex mixtures such as biological samples. This thesis demonstrates the power of NMR for non-invasive quantification of metabolic profiles, both in parallel with conventional cell culture methods and combination with microfluidic in operando culture of HCC and NK cells. This research explores the applications of both conventional and microfluidic NMR in investigating the metabolic reprogramming undergone by cells during tumourigenic transformation and immune responses. The combination of NMR and a novel microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device is demonstrated, enabling in situ culture of primary immune cells and HCC cell lines. The μNMR system includes a hydrothermal heating system to enable continuous in situ NMR observation of cell culture over a 24 hour period and is able to measure millimolar concentrations at microlitre volumes.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"MPM model: A cross-platform massive open online course (MOOC) performance monitoring and measurement model based on MOOC learning analytics","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490809/","Wan Sazli Nasaruddin Saifudin","June 2024","Over the past ten years, most higher education institutions have employed Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to deliver educational materials and activities. MOOC learning analytics data is readily available, which is one of its primary characteristics. Sadly, there are still problems with student dropout, retention, and engagement on MOOCs, which reduces their usefulness as a learning tool. More research is urgently needed to determine how to monitor, assess, and enhance learning delivered through online platforms. The researchers designed the research to solve specific practical problems and answer certain questions. The Ministry of Education Malaysia's requirement partly motivates this study, and the semantic web concept inspires it to investigate learning analytics in different MOOC platforms. The aim is to find a way to utilise the existing learning analytics data from MOOCs for monitoring and measuring a course or learner performance. An initial study led this research to three main research questions and research objectives. The first research objective is identifying parameters and algorithms for measuring course and learner performance using existing learning analytics. The second research objective is to propose a generic model for monitoring course and learner performance at macro and micro levels using MOOC learning analytics, which resembles the cross-platform features. The third objective is to observe and evaluate the MPM Model’s usability. This study used Applied research using mixed methods. The researchers designed the research to solve specific practical problems and answer certain questions. A combination of various research methods and activities, such as observation, simulations, experiments, and surveys, are used throughout different phases of this research study. Phase 1 is a literature review and preliminary study. Phase 2 is data analysis and algorithm development. Phase 3 is the MPM model design, development and experiments. Phase 4 is MPM Model user usability testing and feedback. Phase 5 is results, discussion and report preparation. A Series of simulations provides us with the information to consider in completing the algorithm design and development of the MPM Model. The  MPM Model experiments showed more insight from analysed MOOC learning analytics data. User usability testing conducted with 20 selected participants indicates good feedback on how a user can use the MPM model, what information it gives them to justify their MOOCs course or learner performance, and what to consider for future improvement. As this study ends, I have effectively addressed and met the established goals and research questions. I assert that MOOC learning analytics will now be more accessible to comprehend and utilise thanks to the MPM Model. This work advances the fields of data science and MOOC education research, particularly in the areas of cross-platform MOOC analytic monitoring and performance reporting.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Schief","4 April 2024","A key barrier to the development of vaccines that induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other viruses of high antigenic diversity is the design of priming immunogens that induce rare bnAb-precursor B cells. The high neutralization breadth of the HIV bnAb 10E8 makes elicitation of 10E8-class bnAbs desirable; however, the recessed epitope within gp41 makes envelope trimers poor priming immunogens and requires that 10E8-class bnAbs possess a long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) with a specific binding motif. We developed germline-targeting epitope scaffolds with affinity for 10E8-class precursors and engineered nanoparticles for multivalent display. Scaffolds exhibited epitope structural mimicry and bound bnAb-precursor human naive B cells in ex vivo screens, protein nanoparticles induced bnAb-precursor responses in stringent mouse models and rhesus macaques, and mRNA-encoded nanoparticles triggered similar responses in mice. Thus, germline-targeting epitope scaffold nanoparticles can elicit rare bnAb-precursor B cells with predefined binding specificities and HCDR3 features.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"The role of AGBL5 in the retina and its contribution to inherited retinal dystrophies","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491301/","Suly Saray Villa Vasquez","June 2024","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common type of inherited retinal degeneration. It affects around 1 in 4000 individuals and account for 25% of cases of vision loss in adults. RP is a genetically heterogeneous disease and can be caused by pathogenic mutations in at least 94 different genes, including AGBL5, which encodes a dual function deglutamylase that is essential for regulating functional levels of tubulin glutamylation in cilia. Mutations in AGBL5 are associated with autosomal recessive RP, for which there are no known treatments or cure. Thus, there is a need for research to understand the disease mechanisms associated with AGBL5 loss and to identify therapeutic targets. This study hypothesised that loss of AGBL5 in human retinal cells impairs ciliogenesis, and that AGBL5 null cell models can be used to investigate opportunities for rescue therapies and obtain functional data of genetic variants. We first aimed to characterise the cellular phenotype of AGBL5 CRISPR knockout ARPE19 cells (AGBL5-/-) compared to their WT counterpart. Western blot and fluorescent immunocytochemistry experiments revealed that AGBL5-/- cells show hyper glutamylation, significantly shorter cilia and lower percentage of ciliated cells than WT cells (p<0.001). The disease phenotype can be rescued by gene augmentation, as demonstrated by transient transfection with a WT AGBL5-eGFP construct. Alternatively, we showed that CRISPR knockout (KO)and siRNA knockdown experiments to reduce the expression of the α-tubulinglutamylase TTLL5, counters for the glutamylation imbalance due to loss of AGBL5and rescued the ciliary phenotype in AGBL5-/- cells. In addition, we showed that this AGBL5-/- cell model can be used to investigate AGBL5 variants, and demonstrated that transient expression of constructs containing variants induce rescue of the disease phenotype comparable to the WT construct, and disease causing variants fail to rescue ciliogenesis. Finally, using coimmunoprecipitation of AGBL5 and mass spectrometry, we identified the exocyst component 4 EXOC4 and the deubiquitinase USP9X as potential protein interactants that could be involved in the regulation of cilia and ciliogenesis by AGBL5. This study reports a clear phenotype in AGBL5-deficient human retinal cell lines consisting of hyper glutamylation, short cilia and reduced ciliogenesis, and illustrated the value of the AGBL5-/- cell model to investigate variants. In addition, it demonstrates the potential effectiveness of AGBL5 augmentation or reduction of TTLL5 expression as therapy, and provides transcriptomic and protein interaction data that can be used by researchers in the field to continue investigating the mechanisms underlying AGBL5-associatedRP.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Investigating physiological host resistance mechanisms to Xylella fastidiosa diseases using XCT imaging and mathematical modelling","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490748/","Nancy Catherine Walker","June 2024","Xylella fastidiosa(X. fastidiosa) is a global bacterial plant pathogen, devastating important crops including grapes, coffee and olives.X. fastidiosainfects host xylem, the tissue responsible for plant water and nutrient transport. It is understood that disease symptoms arise due to blockages to xylem flow caused both directly by the presence of the pathogen (biofilms) and by plant associated structures formed in the host immune response (e.g.tyloses). However, specifics of these within-host dynamics are poorly characterised. As such, there remains no cure forX. fastidiosadiseases in the open field. Despite this, even among susceptible taxa, some hosts are resistant to disease, and are considered a critical resource for rebuilding lost agriculture. Xylem structure has been correlated with resistance for a small number of hosts comparing one susceptible and one resistant variety within the same taxonomic group. However, identified morphological traits have not been generalised or compared more broadly. Furthermore, mechanisms by which these traits could be facilitating resistance are rarely considered.In this thesis, a mathematical model is developed describing bulkX. fastidiosabiofilm dynamics within xylem vessels. Model simulations are compared with microfluidic experiments, showing good qualitative agreement. Importantly, simulations suggest that even small amounts of biofilm induce significant reductions in hydraulic conductivity on infected vessels, with developed structures having the potential to fully bridge vessel lumen. This indicates that biofilm occlusions have significant direct influence on symptom development. The remaining work in this thesis uses X-ray Computed Tomography to obtain xylem morphological metrics among resistant and susceptible olive and citrus cultivars. Trends in the measurements are then related to biofilm spread, air embolism susceptibility and hydraulic conductivity using mathematical models. Measurements indicate that resistant olive cultivar Leccino has both narrower vessels, and a lack of the widest vessels, compared to considered susceptible olive (Koroneiki, Ogliarola) and citrus (Pera sweet orange) cultivars. Results show that not only does this make the vasculature of Leccino particularly resistant to air embolisms, but it also greatly reduces biofilm spread in the vessels compared to the considered susceptible plants. Interestingly this trend is not found in resistant olive cultivar FS17, for which it is hypothesised xylem morphology plays a limited role in its resistance. Furthermore, the distinguishing morphological trait found in the resistant citrus (Tangor Murcott) plants is distinct from that found in Leccino. In particular, results suggest that though they do not have narrow vessels, the vasculature is significantly more connected than the other considered plants. It is hypothesised that these connections provide critical flow paths for bypassing vessel occlusions. Finally, both susceptible olive and citrus plants are found to have significantly more vessels than the resistant types. This represents a potentially important broader reaching trend for identifying candidate resistant plant varieties in relation to both recent and novel outbreaks.","Tech","University of Southampton"

However, often the resultingsub-systems are designed in isolation with little indication as tothe impact of design decisions on system level performance. Thefollowing paper demonstrates the increased risk of rework resultingfrom the naive recombination of such seemingly optimalsub-systems and goes on to demonstrate two approaches which can potentially help. The first proposes the adoption of a design in context based approach, where sub-systems are aware of the potential impact of their decisions on the wider system. The second augments this approach with a system level coordination step employing a surrogate model. The performance of each strategy is demonstrated using a realistic whole engine mechanical model for an ultra high bypass ratio (UHBR) gas turbine as a case study.The design in context approach is demonstrated to considerably reduce the level of infeasibility at the system level, while including some system level coordination not only reduces the level of infeasibility but improves the quality of the final system design and the rate of convergence towards it.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Maritime messages from the past: How to bring a traditional, regionally diverse boat collection alive","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490845/","Yingying Yan","June 2024","Managing and preserving traditional wooden boats is challenging due to their size and susceptibility to decay, especially when they come in large groups; they are less recognised by the public in comparison to larger shipwrecks; disconnection may arise when the public sees boats on display, as they are naturally expected to be on water or on shore. This research explored the value of the Goddard collection in the broader context of maritime heritage. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this study integrated museology, archaeology, and heritage studies. The focus was on the museum display communication model, supplemented by Holden's cultural value model (2006). By comparing the Goddard collection with other global small boat museums, this research identified strategies to effectively communicate the collection's value, highlighting its potential to represent diverse maritime cultures and contribute to socio-economic benefits. The research underscores the essence of strategic representation in maritime collections and offers a fresh perspective for museums and heritage practitioners, emphasising the importance of tailored communication and effective audience engagement.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Assessing the potential suitability of dynamic membrane system for post-treatment of effluents from municipal wastewater plants in Saudi Arabia using MCDM approaches","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491345/","Mohammad Hassan Zamzami","June 2024","This study aimed to assess the potential of Dynamic Membrane (DM) technology as a feasible alternative to conventional tertiary filtration options for upgrading secondary effluents from wastewater treatment in Saudi Arabia. Initially, An initial trial was conducted to investigate whether this could be achieved by looking at DM system design based on calculation methods used for conventional treatment systems and parameter values for DM performance extracted from literature data. The research shifted to comparing three tertiary treatment alternatives viz Rapid Sand Filtration (RSF), Microfiltration and ultrafiltration (MF/UF), and DM to investigate the optimal choice for Saudi conditions. RSF technology is a tertiary treatment option with relatively low maintenance and operational expenses. However, it has limitations, such as head loss build-up and significant chemical pre-treatment requirements. MF/UF technology is gaining popularity for upgrading the sewage treatment plants (STP) in Saudi Arabia due to stricter regulations and water reuse initiatives. However, membrane fouling, and operational cleaning costs are challenges to using these systems in tertiary wastewater treatment, especially in remote areas. DM is a novel approach to wastewater treatment that relies on a layer of the deposited material to act as a self-generated barrier to filter wastewater particles. multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches were used to provide a structured and logical method when comparing the proposed tertiary options. The research required the engagement of participants as decision-makers who followed a structured survey incorporating three parts, i.e., RSF performance, choosing by advantage (CBA), and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). It involved interviews with 20 individuals from different cities in the Al-Qassim and Riyadh provinces. These individuals had an average of 12 years of experience in wastewater treatment, particularly in operation and maintenance. Their job responsibilities included the regular operation of Saudi STP with a daily flow range of 75 to 400000 m3/day. A comparison of proposed options was conducted along three dimensions i.e. environmental, economic, and technical, each with its own set of factors. In total, 16 factors were identified for assessing the option, including removal rates for total suspended solids (TSS), microplastics (MPs), chemical oxygen demand (COD), Escherichia Coli (E. Coli), Fecal Coliforms (FC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) within the environmental dimension. Within the economic dimension, factors included energy consumption, area required, chemicals-filtration, and chemicals-cleaning. The technical dimension encompasses factors of small cleaning interval (SCI), small cleaning time (SCT), major cleaning interval (MCI), and major cleaning time (MCT). The task of comparing these three options is unusually challenging because some of them are familiar and widely used while others are novel, and this is the first time a set of factors for comparison of them in the current application has been identified. The overall outcomes revealed that the RSF earned the greatest choice from the participants' views, followed by DM and MF/UF. The work developed and tested a modified version of the CBA approach using an option of dummy technology (DT) to preserve data on participants' preferences. This may be particularly suitable for situations where there are only a small number of alternatives. Although easier to use, conventional CBA may be less favourable to low-tech, low-cost applications. The research concluded that modified CBA and AHP were suitable for comparing options with widely different levels of familiarity and technical sophistication. Participants' responses were collected individually, enabling analysis of factors that influenced them. No major differences were found between responses from participants at large and small STP.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Enhancing privacy and scalability of permissioned blockchain.","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/491205/","Gilberto Zanfino","June 2024","Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers fascinating properties of data integrity and non-repudiation. As the name suggests, it consists of consecutive chained blocks, replicated on all network nodes, containing asset transactions. Blocks are linked together via hashing procedures and created in a distributed fashion with consensus protocols. Besides, blockchain provides smart contracts, self-executable programs that allow to realise fully decentralised and tamper-proof applications. In this thesis, we analyse five prominent blockchain platforms, i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum 2.0, Algorand, Ethereum-private and Hyperledger Fabric. We evaluate their security according to the used consensus algorithm, the overall infrastructure and the smart contracts vulnerabilities. We then focus on permissioned blockchains, operated by authenticated parties. Although they can enforce access control rules and are more efficient compared to permissionless, they still lack of data privacy and present scalability issues. A typical privacy solution is to encrypt data before being stored on blockchain, but the downside is that smart contracts can no longer execute functions on them. We thus propose to combine blockchain with Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a cryptographic model that allows to perform computations on ciphertexts. We show how blockchain coupled with HE can be beneficially applied to Smart Grid to realise privacy-preserving energy billing and trading. HE has a limitation, however: it precludes computations on data encrypted with different keys. To overcome this, we extend the previous integration with Multi-Key HE (MKHE). We thus present PANTHER, a MKHE-integrated permissioned blockchain, where users can run smart contracts over ciphertexts created with different keys. Results of MKHE computations are then decrypted in PANTHER via secure multiparty protocols among users. For scalability instead, blockchain exhibits an intrinsic problem: adding new nodes to cope with increasing demands worsens performance, due to a lengthening of the time to reach consensus. We thus present SHERLOCK, a permissioned blockchain in which consensus nodes are split into committees and disposed on a two-layer ring-based architecture. SHERLOCK uses the sharding technique to assign incoming transactions to committees, which process them in parallel, thereby boosting performance.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Characteristics of the flow around finite wall-mounted square cylinders and the mechanism of tonal noise","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490962/","Yanan Wang; Boyu Ma; Zhiwei Hu; David Thompson","25 May 2024","Motivated by the need to reduce the noise from train pantographs, numerical simulations are carried out for the flow over finite wall-mounted square cylinders with different aspect ratios at a Reynolds number of 1.5x10^4. Five aspect ratios (height-to-width ratios) are taken into account, namely, 1.4, 4.3, 7.1, 10 and 12.9. The effect of the aspect ratio on the aerodynamic coefficients, the near-wall flow topologies and the pressure distributions are studied in detail to give insight into the noise generation mechanisms. The pressure rate of change dp/dt on the cylinder surfaces is adopted to evaluate the dipole noise source. It turns out that distributions of dp/dt are closely related with flow evolutions near the free ends and the wall-mounting junctions of cylinders with different aspect ratios. High levels of dp/dt are found close to lateral trailing edges of the cylinder, while the strength grows quickly as the aspect ratio is increased. The far-field noise emitted from these cylinders is predicted using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy and validated with wind tunnel measurements available in the literature. For receivers located in the cross-flow direction, a single acoustic tone near a Strouhal number of 0.1 is observed for cylinders with aspect ratios not greater than 7, while an additional tone at a higher Strouhal number occurs as the aspect ratio is further increased. The underlying mechanism of the tonal noise emitted to the far field is also investigated by combining the noise source localization and dynamic mode decompositions.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"A comparative aging study of various commercial biodegradable insulation fluids","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/481966/","Ian Hosier; Paul Lewin; Thomas Andritsch; Gordon Wilson","4 September 2023","The aging behaviour of three insulation fluids from sustainable sources (natural ester, synthetic ester, and a bio-based hydrocarbon fluid) were compared with that of a conventional mineral oil. All samples contained kraft paper and its degree of polymerisation (DP) confirmed that the aged samples covered most of the transformer lifecycle. The reported mitigating effect of ester oils on paper aging was observed in both ester oils whilst the bio-based hydrocarbon fluid exhibited comparable behaviour to the mineral oil. Natural ester had the highest values of acidity, viscosity and dielectric loss after aging and the bio-based hydrocarbon oil the lowest. The bio-based hydrocarbon fluid would be an excellent replacement for mineral oil in plant, particularly due to its very low viscosity which would aid cooling but with the drawback that paper aging is not mitigated. A synthetic ester is preferable over a natural ester in plant since its chemical, physical and dielectric properties do not deteriorate dramatically after aging.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Strengthened Circle and Popov Criteria and the analysis of ReLU neural networks","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490608/","Carl R. Richardson; Matthew C. Turner; Steve R. Gunn","22 May 2024","Many systems involving neural networks (NNs) can be framed as Lurie systems: feedback systems consisting of a linear time-invariant (LTI) part and a static nonlinearity. Examples of these include the interconnection of LTI systems with L-layer feedforward NNs [1], [2] and continuous time recurrent neural networks (RNN) [3]. Stability analysis of a Lurie system lends itself to a range of criteria from absolute stability; however, in NN analysis, the size of m (see Fig. 1 where u, y in Rem) is typically large. As a result, existing absolute stability criteria suffer from greater conservatism and/or computational complexity [4]. This paper addresses this problem by strengthening the low complexity classical Circle and Popov Criteria for the specialised case of the repeated ReLU nonlinearity (a popular NN activation function). The results are cast as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with less restrictive conditions on the matrix variables than their classical counterparts. A full version of this paper has recently been in published in [5].","Tech","University of Southampton"

Consequently, peroxisome dysfunction leads to pediatric-onset neurodegenerative conditions, including Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders (PBD). Due to the dynamic, tissue-specific, and context-dependent nature of their biogenesis and function, live cell imaging of peroxisomes is essential for studying peroxisome regulation, as well as for the diagnosis of PBD-linked abnormalities. However, the peroxisomal imaging toolkit is lacking in many respects, with no reporters for substrate import, nor cell-permeable probes that could stain dysfunctional peroxisomes. Here we report that the BODIPY-C12 fluorescent fatty acid probe stains functional and dysfunctional peroxisomes in live mammalian cells. We then go on to improve BODIPY-C12, generating peroxisome-specific reagents, PeroxiSPY650 and PeroxiSPY555. These probes combine high peroxisome specificity, bright fluorescence in the red and far-red spectrum, and fast non-cytotoxic staining, making them ideal tools for live cell, whole organism, or tissue imaging of peroxisomes. Finally, we demonstrate that PeroxiSPY enables diagnosis of peroxisome abnormalities in the PBD CRISPR/Cas9 cell models and patient-derived cell lines.","Tech","University of Southampton"

The five text classification tasks are fake news classification, topic detection, emotion detection, polarity detection, and sarcasm detection. While in practice, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP), research tends to focus on the most sophisticated models, we hypothesize that this is not always necessary. Therefore, our main objective is to investi gate whether the largest state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are always preferred, or in what cases simple methods can compete with complex models, i.e. for which dataset specifications and classification tasks. We assess the performance of different methods with varying complexity, ranging from simple statistical and machine learning methods to pretrained transformers like robustly optimized BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) pretrain ing approach (RoBERTa). This comprehensive benchmark is lacking in existing literature, with research mainly comparing similar types of methods. Furthermore, with increasing awareness of the ecological impacts of extensive computational resource usage, this comparison is both critical and timely. We find that overall, bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) net works are ranked as the best-performing method albeit not statistically significantly better than logistic regression and RoBERTa. Overall, we cannot conclude that simple methods perform worse although this depends mainly on the classification task. Concretely, we find that for fake news classification and topic detection, simple techniques are the best-ranked models and consequently, it is not necessary to train complicated neural network architectures for these classification tasks. Moreover, we also find a negative correlation between F1 performance and complexity for the smallest datasets (with dataset size less than 10,000). Finally, the different models’ results are analyzed in depth to explain the model decisions, which is an increasing requirement in the field of text classification.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"(Re)Negotiating creativity: Sustaining digital and creative careers over the life course","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490262/","Ben Thomas","21 May 2024","Attaining and sustaining a career in the digital and creative industries is hard. Training that is often expensive and difficult to navigate, informal hiring practices, precarious employment, and long, intense, and inflexible hours, all come together to limit access and progression for many people. Moreover, as these conditions interact with people’s changing priorities and needs over the life course, the ability to sustain work is often not possible, reflected in the high rates of worker attrition (Carey et al., 2020; Steele, 2022). With a critical labour shortage in these industries, tackling the loss of older workers by addressing the challenges of digital and creative work is important. While there is much recent literature which speaks to the challenges (for example Brook, O’Brien and Taylor, 2020; Wallis, van Raalte and Allegrini, 2020), less is said about those people who have managed to sustain their careers in the face of these challenges, whose circumstances present examples of the conditions which are needed in order not to be ‘filtered out’. This thesis addresses this gap, exploring the strategies that older workers in the fields of Video, Games, and Websites have been able to use in order to sustain their careers.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Aldrighetti; Mohammed Abu Hilal","17 January 2024","Purpose: to compare outcomes after laparoscopic versus open major liver resection (hemihepatectomy) mainly for primary or metastatic cancer. The primary outcome measure was time to functional recovery. Secondary outcomes included morbidity, quality of life (QoL), and for those with cancer, resection margin status and time to adjuvant systemic therapy.Patients and methods: this was a multicenter, randomized controlled, patient-blinded, superiority trial on adult patients undergoing hemihepatectomy. Patients were recruited from 16 hospitals in Europe between November 2013 and December 2018.Results: of the 352 randomly assigned patients, 332 patients (94.3%) underwent surgery (laparoscopic, n = 166 and open, n = 166) and comprised the analysis population. The median time to functional recovery was 4 days (IQR, 3-5; range, 1-30) for laparoscopic hemihepatectomy versus 5 days (IQR, 4-6; range, 1-33) for open hemihepatectomy (difference, –17.5% [96% CI, –25.6 to –8.4]; P < .001). There was no difference in major complications (laparoscopic 24/166 [14.5%] v open 28/166 [16.9%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.84; P = .58). Regarding QoL, both global health status (difference, 3.2 points; P < .001) and body image (difference, 0.9 points; P < .001) scored significantly higher in the laparoscopic group. For the 281 (84.6%) patients with cancer, R0 resection margin status was similar (laparoscopic 106 [77.9%] v open 122 patients [84.1%], OR, 0.60; P = .14) with a shorter time to adjuvant systemic therapy in the laparoscopic group (46.5 days v 62.8 days, hazard ratio, 2.20; P = .009).Conclusion: among patients undergoing hemihepatectomy, the laparoscopic approach resulted in a shorter time to functional recovery compared with open surgery. In addition, it was associated with a better QoL, and in patients with cancer, a shorter time to adjuvant systemic therapy with no adverse impact on cancer outcomes observed.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Cooperative hybrid beamforming for the mitigation of realistic asynchronous interference in cell-free mmWave MIMO networks","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490283/","Meesam Jafri; Suraj Srivastava; Pankaj Kumar; Aditya K. Jagannatham; Lajos Hanzo","13 May 2024","Cooperative hybrid transmit precoder (TP) and receive combiner (RC) design algorithms are conceived for cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) networks, operating in the face of asynchronous interference (ASI). To begin with, a Wiener filteringbased optimal hybrid TP/RC (WHB-U) design is proposed for unicast scenarios that minimizes the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) between the received signal and the desired signal subject to user-specific power constraints. Next, a signal-to-leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) maximization-based hybrid TP/RC design (SHB-U) is conceived, which reduces the interference engendered by the signal transmission targeted towards a specific user, rather than focuses on the interference at a particular user. Next, a multicast transmission scenario is considered, wherein the users belonging to a particular multicast group request identical information. Toward this, the WHB-M and SHB-M hybrid TP/RC schemes are designed for mitigating both the inter-user and inter-group interference. Subsequently, we also develop a Bayesian learning (BL)-based framework for jointly designing the RF and baseband (BB) TPs/RCs for both unicast and multicast scenarios, which does not require the full knowledge of mmWave MIMO channel components. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed TP/RC schemes is extensively evaluated by simulations both in terms of their ability to mitigate the ASI, and the spectral efficiency attained.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Williams","17 May 2024","Tyre wear particles are generated by the frictional forces between a tyre and the road during driving. Tyre wear represents one of the biggest sources of synthetic polymer-based material released into the environment, significantly contributing to microplastic pollution and the associated ecological consequences. However, the extent of tyre particle pollution is not fully understood, and research and understanding are hindered by a lack of described chemical compounds that meet all the criteria for an effective marker of tyre particles. The aims of this study were to develop a methodology for generating tyre particles using a pin-on-disc tribometer; and to distinguish the chemical components in the particles – using two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry – to propose a suite of potential markers. The results show that the morphology of the tyre particles reflected that of particles generated in previous literature and during driving. Additionally, the suggested markers were common across the three tyre brands studied here, thus meeting one of the criteria for a successful marker. Future research into measuring the concentration of tyre particles in environmental samples is necessary to understand further their distribution, and assessing the contribution of tyre particles to non-exhaust emissions can inform on future engineering strategies to minimise their release.","Tech","University of Southampton"

This study aims to identify and determine the effectiveness of previously reported methods or tests for the identification of surgical NEC.Methods: systematic review and meta-analysis with registration on PROSPERO including articles describing a method of identifying surgical NEC. Outcomes of interest were effectiveness and repeatability of index test.Results: of the 190 full-text articles screened, 90 studies were included which contained 114 methods of identifying surgical NEC in 9546 infants. Of these methods, 44 were a scoring system, 37 a single biomarker, 24 an imaging method and 9 an invasive method. Sensitivity and specificity ranged from 12.8-100% and 13-100%, respectively. Some methods (9.6%) provided insufficient methods for repeatability within clinical practice or research. Meta-analyses were possible for only 2 methods, the metabolic derangement 7 score and abdominal ultrasound.Conclusions: a range of methods for identifying surgical NEC have been identified with varying overall performance and uncertainties about reproducibility and superiority of any method. External validation in large multicentre datasets should allow direct comparison of accuracy and prospective study should evaluate impact on clinical outcomes.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Racism in China’s English language teaching industry: English as a race-making technology","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490400/","Shuling Wang","2 May 2024","This article argues that racism is pervasive in China's English language teaching (ELT) industry, yet it is often ignored. It presents that English language education in China should be understood historically in a way that recognizes English as a racializing technology. As a race-making technology, English has continued making modern Chinese subjects while also posing a threat to Chineseness in the 21st century. This intertwining of race and the English language has translated into a massive ELT industry in China that reproduces whiteness, influencing hiring practices and preferences for White English teachers. Additionally, race intersects with gender, nationality, and class, leading to a highly racialized and gendered ELT industry, exemplified in discourses of “foreign experts” and “foreign trash” popular in China's context. The article concludes by asserting that the English language, as a race-making technology, has structured the ELT industry, and discussing its implications for future research and practical changes to challenge intersectional racism in the industry.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Moreover, we show that the secondary spin is strongly correlated with the other intrinsic parameters, and it can not be constrained for ϵ ≲ 10−5. Finally, we highlight the need for addressing eccentric waveform systematics in the small-mass-ratio regime, as they yield stronger biases than the circular limit in both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Treatments can include invasive surgery or high systemic drug dosages, which lack precision, localization, and control. Drug delivery systems (DDSs) that can deliver cargo to the cardiac injury site could address these unmet clinical challenges. Here, a microrobotic DDS that can be mobilized to specific sites via magnetic control is presented. This DDS incorporates an internal chamber that can protect drug cargo. Furthermore, the DDS contains a tunable thermosensitive sealing layer that gradually degrades upon exposure to body temperature, enabling prolonged drug release. Once loaded with the small molecule drug norepinephrine, this microrobotic DDS modulated beating frequency in induced pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) in a dose-dependent manner, thus simulating drug delivery to cardiac cells in vitro. The DDS also navigates several maze-like structures seeded with cardiomyocytes to demonstrate precise locomotion under a rotating low-intensity magnetic field and on-site drug delivery. This work demonstrates the utility of a magnetically actuating DDS for precise, localized, and controlled drug delivery which is of interest for a myriad of future opportunities such as in treating cardiac diseases.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Bagot; Yiqiang Wang; Diego Alba Venero; Stuart Robertson; Gebril M.A.M. El-Fallah; Hongbo Guo; Michael P. Moody; Bo Chen","14 March 2024","This paper reports the use of combined electron microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe into the compositional and size evolution of the primary carbides and nanoparticles (defined by a size threshold of 100 nm) in an additively manufactured high-alloy steel before and after heat treatment. The primary carbides exhibit marginal changes in their total volume fraction and size after the austenitising and tempering. However, those carbides located at the prior-austenite boundaries provide a pinning effect to impede grain growth during the austenitising. The grain size increases from 1.7 µm in the as-manufactured to 2.8 µm in the as-tempered conditions, resulting in a limited strength loss of 33–126 MPa as estimated by using the Hall-Petch relationship. Atom probe tomography, which offers atomic spatial resolution examining a sample volume of 6.6 × 105 nm3, reveals the presence of numerous V and Cr-enriched nanoparticles with sizes of 1 to 10 nm within the steel matrix after the tempering. In contrast, the complementary SANS which examines a significantly larger sample volume of 0.9 mm3 but lacking spatial resolution, provides nanoparticle size information. It reveals a radius reduction from 7.6 to 1.0 nm and a volume fraction increase from 1.6 % to 2.3 %, in the as-manufactured and as-tempered conditions, respectively. The nanoparticles induced during tempering can contribute to a strength enhancement of 691 MPa, primarily through the Orowan bypass mechanism. This suggests that the combination of limited prior-austenite grain growth and the presence of nanoparticles is the key factor responsible for the unprecedented material strength.","Tech","University of Southampton"

The commercial sector, in particular, has experienced rapid growth, outpacing regulatory developments due to substantial financial incentives. The UK construction sector exemplifies a case where the regulatory framework for drones remains unclear. This article investigates the state of UK legislation on commercial drone use in construction through a thematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature. Four main themes, including opportunities, safety risks, privacy risks, and the regulatory context, were identified along with twenty-one sub-themes such as noise and falling materials. Findings reveal a fragmented regulatory landscape, combining byelaws, national laws, and EU regulations, creating business uncertainty. Our study recommends the establishment of specific national guidelines for commercial drone use, addressing uncertainties and building public trust, especially in anticipation of the integration of ‘autonomous’ drones. This research contributes to the responsible computing domain by uncovering regulatory gaps and issues in UK drone law, particularly within the often-overlooked context of the construction sector. The insights provided aim to inform future responsible computing practices and policy development in the evolving landscape of commercial drone technology.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Primrose","15 February 2024","Barrett's oesophagus is the only known precursor to oesophageal adenocarcinoma, a cancer with very poor prognosis. The main risk factors for Barrett's oesophagus are a history of gastro-oesophageal acid reflux symptoms and obesity. Men, smokers and those with a family history are also at increased risk. Progression from Barrett's oesophagus to cancer occurs via an intermediate stage, known as dysplasia. However, dysplasia and early cancer usually develop without any clinical signs, often in individuals whose symptoms are well controlled by acid suppressant medications; therefore, endoscopic surveillance is recommended to allow for early diagnosis and timely clinical intervention. Individuals with Barrett's oesophagus need to be fully informed about the implications of this diagnosis and the benefits and risks of monitoring strategies. Pharmacological treatments are recommended for control of symptoms, but not for chemoprevention. Dysplasia and stage 1 oesophageal adenocarcinoma have excellent prognoses, since they can be cured with endoscopic or surgical therapies. Endoscopic resection is the most accurate staging technique for early Barrett's-related oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic ablation is effective and indicated to eradicate Barrett's oesophagus in patients with dysplasia. Future research should focus on improved accuracy for dysplasia detection via new technologies and providing more robust evidence to support pathways for follow-up and treatment.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Explainable Learning Analytics: assessing the stability of student success prediction models by means of explainable AI","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490778/","Elena Tiukhova; Pavani Vemuri; Nidia lópez Flores; Anna Sigridur Islind; María Óskarsdóttir; Stephan Poelmans; Bart Baesens; Monique Snoeck","26 April 2024","Beyond managing student dropout, higher education stakeholders need decision support to consistently influence the student learning process to keep students motivated, engaged, and successful. At the course level, the combination of predictive analytics and self-regulation theory can help instructors determine the best study advice and allow learners to better self-regulate and determine how they want to learn. The best performing techniques are often black-box models that favor performance over interpretability and are heavily influenced by course contexts. In this study, we argue that explainable AI has the potential not only to uncover the reasons behind model decisions, but also to reveal their stability across contexts, effectively bridging the gap between predictive and explanatory learning analytics (LA). In contributing to decision support systems research, this study (1) leverages traditional techniques, such as concept drift and performance drift, to investigate the stability of student success prediction models over time; (2) uses Shapley Additive explanations in a novel way to explore the stability of extracted feature importance rankings generated for these models; (3) generates new insights that emerge from stable features across cohorts, enabling teachers to determine study advice. We believe this study makes a strong contribution to education research at large and expands the field of LA by augmenting the interpretability and explainability of prediction algorithms and ensuring their applicability in changing contexts.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Machine learning for automated, targeted, phototherapy","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490071/","Matthew Praeger; Joseph Scott; James A. Grant-Jacob","30 January 2024","This work combines two existing technologies to demonstrate the possibility for automated, targeted, phototherapy of psoriasis and other skin conditions: 1) Image-to-image translation via a neural network (NN) as a method of image segmentation. 2) Light control using a digital micromirror device (DMD). With a small dataset of just 104 patient photographs (labeled by expert dermatologists) our NN model was trained to identify regions of psoriasis that required treatment, achieving an average accuracy of 96.6 %. The image output of the NN model was applied to a DMD and precise control over the shape of the illuminated region was demonstrated. In the proposed automated phototherapy device this would target treatment to the affected regions, minimizing exposure of healthy skin and the associated risks of patient harm.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"An integrated geospatial data model for active travel infrastructure","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489886/","Chris Hill; Marcus Young; Simon Blainey; Stefano Cavazzi; Chris Emberson","26 April 2024","Active travel has received increased investment and interest in many countries both due to COVID-19 and to policies which promote a shift in mobility behaviours to support a wide range of public and individual goods. However, while there has often been substantial investment in the physical infrastructure that can help facilitate active travel, there has not so far always been commensurate investment in the data infrastructure which can help enable people to shift trips to active modes. Current fragmented data and data models and a lack of data standards pose a barrier to the development of the applications which are needed to support planners, users and journey planning. There is therefore a need for a more integrated, better-connected and more richly attributed active travel geospatial network model. This paper describes the development of such a data model, and its initial application to a case study of Great Britain. It demonstrates how the development, population and maintenance of such a data model could facilitate a range of novel applications, such as the personalisation of active travel journey planning to address different user needs and capabilities. If the potential societal benefits from investment in physical active travel infrastructure are to be fully realised, this needs to be supported by the availability of a robust spatial data infrastructure capable of providing the information required by walkers, wheeled users and cyclists to make effective use of the active travel network.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Impacts of land acquisition across communities: Exploring the special economic zones in Bangladesh","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489831/","Md Moniruzzaman","1 May 2024","Special economic zones (SEZs) are delineated geographical places established with distinct regulations for attracting investment to achieve diverse economic benefits. The emergence of the SEZs has aggravated the contentious issue of land acquisition and development globally with substantial gaps between their anticipated and actual benefits for the land-acquired communities. Bangladesh is establishing 100 new SEZs across the country acquiring rural community lands and proposing numerous benefits, the impacts of which are unknown from the community context. The existing literature highlights the impacts of land acquisition in Bangladesh from the perspective of land loss without considering the development benefits of implemented projects. The resettlement policy and implementation issues are also understudied in the land acquisition literature in the Bangladesh context, which are crucially linked to the impacts.Conceptualising through the capabilities approach, this study aims to examine the impacts of land acquisition on the capabilities of individuals within communities in the recently developed SEZs. Positioning freedom of choice over wealth and opulence, the capabilities approach provides a wider perspective for capturing nuances of impacts. Based on a qualitative review of policies relating to land acquisition and resettlement, semi-structured interviews with community members as well as experts in government and NGO personnel were conducted. Three SEZs of Bangladesh with distinct geographical features and at different development stages are selected to understand the impacts on economic, social–affective, and personal (physio-psychological) aspects of well-being through the core capabilities of individuals across the livelihoods of locales and occupations.Findings with novel insights into dispossession reveal that land acquisition with poor implementation of resettlement policies affects the capabilities of the land-losing as well as evicted individuals who are dependent on land and natural resources. Findings also suggest that SEZs with employment and other opportunities advance the capabilities of the individuals from land-losing, without land-losing, and previously landless households. Findings further suggest that despite experiencing capability deprivation in the land-losing context, women were able to enhance their capabilities relating to economic, social–affective, and personal well-being through participation in paid work and other economic activities. This study contributes by filling the knowledge gap in understanding the impacts of SEZs, extending the application of the capabilities approach, and providing new insights into drivers of dispossession. Other implications of this study lie in providing policy recommendations for Bangladesh and beyond—e.g., in countries with similar land–livelihoods relations—as well as opening scopes for further academic research.Keywords: Land acquisition, special economic zone, displacement, dispossession, resettlement, capabilities, well-being, livelihoods, communities, Bangladesh.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"“We are detective”: transvestigations, conspiracy and inauthenticity in ‘gender critical’ social media discourses","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490344/","Lexi Webster","1 May 2024","This article explores the socio-behavioral phenomenon of “transvestigations” in social media discourses. This phenomenon is most often characterized by users referring – erroneously – to apparent physiological cues of one's assigned sex at birth, which motivate their interpretation of one's transgender status, particularly among those who do not identify as transgender and focus primarily on cisgender celebrities. It is difficult to know whether these behaviors and interactions are symptomatic of an authentic “gender critical” ideology or inauthentic practices that only fan the flames of antagonism in an ongoing social struggle. In this paper, I explain how transvestigations are primarily based on transphobic “gender critical” discourses and are fundamentally underpinned by a conspiracy of transgender ubiquity. I also explain how transgender users and their allies troll transvestigators by mocking the same discourses and assumptions. To do so, I analyze social media data using methods from cultural political economy and social-cognitive discourse studies. I argue that the possibilities and uses of social media for misinformation, conspiracy, and mimetic antagonism facilitate a discursive landscape in which authentic ""gender-critical"" discourses are indistinguishable from potentially inauthentic conspiratorial discourses. By highlighting how social media and its users (re)construct a world without distinction between authenticity and inauthenticity, this article raises questions about the im/possibilities of change in contexts of ongoing and ever-increasing antagonisms.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Development of a measure to evaluate paediatric end of life care in Jordan","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490290/","Rawnaq, Mohammad Almahadeen","January 2022","A child’s death is a painful experience for family members, regardless of the cause. Previous research has emphasised the need for a standardised measure to assess the quality of paediatric end of life care from carers’ perspectives to identify and address services in need of improvement. Paediatric end of life care has received little attention in the Middle East, especially Jordan, where a lack of guidelines hinders healthcare professionals from planning and delivering high quality care.   Aims To adapt an existing measure of the experiences of bereaved carers of adults - Views Of Informal Carers- Evaluation of Services- Short Form (VOICES-SF) questionnaire -, undertake cross-cultural adaptation and assess the feasibility of conducting a telephone-administered survey in Jordan to evaluate the quality of end of life care provided to dying children from the perspective of bereaved carers.   This exploratory mixed-methods study entailed three phases. Phase I involved identifying key elements of paediatric end of life care from three sources: literature, bereaved carers and healthcare professionals in the United Kingdom. This led to development of the English VOICES-Children (-C) questionnaire. Phase II involved Arabic translation and cross-cultural adaptation for the Jordanian context. Five experts in Jordan reviewed the Arabic prototype before cognitive testing with bereaved carers in Jordan (N=8). In phase III, the VOICES-C Arabic version was piloted through a telephone administered survey with bereaved carers (N=48) recruited from four hospitals in Jordan. The survey explored feasibility of a protocol for identification, approach and data collection, as well as quality of care.   Phase I involved developing the VOICES-C questionnaire items based on three different sources. Items regarding physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects were retained from the adult version of the questionnaire, items relating to sibling support and circumstances surrounding the death were added, and response options were modified to reflect children’s services in the UK. In phase II cultural adaptation involved translation and additional modifications to individual items and response options to align with the Jordanian context and ensure Arabic language equivalence. The phase III pilot study confirmed feasibility of the protocol for identification, approach, recruitment and data collection method in order to collect bereaved carers’ experiences about end of life care for children with life-limiting conditions by telephone. Distress associated with participation was minimal and procedures to deal with distress were suitable. Findings relating to quality and experiences of care suggested that currently end of life care for children was largely satisfactory in participating sites in Jordan. Negative reports of quality of care were mainly by carers of neonates in rural hospitals concerning coordinating and continuing care whenever available resources were limited.   This study represents a novel contribution to evaluating the quality of end of life care provided to dying children and their families in various hospitals and for different medical conditions in an Arabic-speaking country, Jordan. It examined and confirmed the feasibility of conducting a telephone survey as the method of administration. If the survey is applied on a regional, national, or organisational level, it has the potential to help shape policy and improve care for dying children. Future studies on the current topic in other Arab-speaking countries are recommended.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Assessing the performance of underwater undulatory swimming techniques with computational fluid dynamics","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490198/","Dorian Alexandre Guillaume Audot","April 2024","Underwater Undulatory Swimming (UUS) is of a major importance in modern competitive swimming. This technique follows a dive or a push off the wall. It consists in reproducing the way of locomotion of marine mammals: a wave travels along the body of a swimmer, from the fingers to the toes, accelerating the flow in its vicinity, and thus propelling them forward. Understanding ways to maximise performance of such a technique is essential to give the leading edge to an athlete. Past studies have looked at ways to maximise swimming speed or ways to observe the flow in the wake and in the vicinity of an athlete (e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Particle Image Velocimetry). These studies often overlooked real race conditions and did not consider when UUS is not performed at maximum effort or when UUS is performed in over-speed (i.e. greater velocities than an athlete can maintain). In order to study both these aspects, the need for fast computation in order to estimate hydrodynamic forces in various configurations arose.It appeared that a methodology using an immersed boundary method with unsteady implicit-LES applied to UUS could provide fast and reliable simulations. With the combination of an accurate kinematics gathering methodology using optoelectronic motion capture and such computations, it was possible to estimate, with acceptable precision, the fluid forces, the instantaneous swimming velocity and deceleration trends of a large number of kinematics data (58 in total). Three short studies applying the methodology developed ensued.The first one consisted in observing a sample of seven swimmers performing UUS at different instructed pace (maximum effort, 100 m pace and 200 m pace). Two groups of athletes were identified and separated regarding the way they adapted their swimming motion to the pace. The first group, in order to reduce their swimming speed, simply reduced their movement frequency while keeping a similar technique form. The second group modified their undulation wavelength significantly when performing UUS at slower paces. The implicit-LES simulations provided useful information to understand how the fluid forces were affected by the change of technique. The second study proposed two possible approaches for modifications of UUS techniques: increasing or reducing an athlete's body segments angular range of motion, or forcing a linear wave propagation along the body. A case study showing insight on how these modifications could affect performance of a university level athlete was undertaken. Results provided by simulations with modified kinematics show insights on the potential direction of training for this athlete in order to maximise their UUS speed. A third and final study observed how quickly various UUS techniques decelerate during the over-speed phases of underwater swimming. It shows the potential benefits of taking advantage of a slower deceleration phase. Additionally, a case study where kinematics of an elite swimmer were modified and inputted in the CFD methodology provides insight on the potential role of the knee flexion on deceleration performance.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Intelligence-aided channel estimation and detection for multi-dimensional index modulation","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490011/","Xinyu Feng","May 2024","Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology is a cornerstone of the Fifth Generation Mobile Systems (5G) wireless communication systems. Although it offers significant gains in Energy Efficiency (EE), Spectral Efficiency (SE), performance and throughput, supporting the escalate increasing and dynamically changing demands of large wireless environments remains a significant challenge. In this case, a prominent technique in next-generation wireless communications known as Index Modulation (IM) building on the MIMO system, develops its unique advantages. The concept of index modulation (IM) has been actively researched due to its flexible performance, SE, EE and hardware trade-offs. In order to further improve the SE, Compressed Sensing (CS) and Multi-dimensional Index Modulation (MIM) have been investigated. However, the flexibility and performance gains achieved with IM come at the cost of increased detection complexity. Channel Estimation (CE) for IM systems presents a challenging problem due to the more complex transmission conditions and the pilot allocation requirements. Conventional detection such as Maximum Likelihood (ML) could achieve near-capacity performance, while the detection complexity of computation will exponentially increase with the increase of the degrees of freedom of the IM. Nowadays, machine learning technology has been widely used in wireless network solving massive data problem by its robust computing capability. With the success of many attempts to combine the complex MIMO system and machine learning to detect the signal, it has been proved that learning-aided detection could significantly reduce the detection complexity. Hence, this thesis focusses on designing composite IM system, which may employ CS and learning based reduced complexity detector. First, we propose Deep Learning (DL) based detection for CS-MIM, where both Hard-Decision (HD) as well as Soft-Decision (SD) detection combined with iterative decoding are conceived. We propose two novel neural network aided methods for Iterative Soft Detection (ISD), where iterations are carried out between the CS-MIM detector and a channel decoder. In contrast to the conventional detection of CS-MIM system, which critically relies on the knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) at the receiver, the proposed learning-aided methods are capable of eliminating the overhead and complexity of CE, which results in an improved transmission rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning techniques conceived for SD CS-MIM combined with iterative detection are capable of achieving near-capacity performance at a reduced complexity compared to the conventional model-based SD relying on CSI acquisition. However, having accurate CSI is essential for reliable MIM, which requires high pilot overhead. Hence, Joint Channel Estimation and data Detection (JCED) is harnessed to reduce the pilot overhead and improve the detection performance at a modestly increased estimation complexity. Then this thesis circumvents this by proposing Deep Learning (DL) based JCED for CS-MIM for significantly reducing the complexity, despite reducing the pilot overhead needed for Channel Estimation (CE). Our simulation results confirm a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is capable of near-capacity JCED of CS-MIM at a reduced pilot overhead and reduced complexity both for Hard-Decision (HD) and SD detection. On the other hand, while MIM uncovers the possibility of combination of IM in different dimensions, roughly assemble of different dimension IM does not fully exploit the flexibility of MIM. In this thesis, we propose Joint Multi-dimensional Index Modulation (JMIM) that can utilize the time-, space- and frequency-dimensions in order to increase the IM mapping design flexibility. Explicitly, this thesis develops a jointly designed MIM architecture combined with CS. Three different JMIM mapping methods are proposed for a space- and frequency-domain aided JMIM system, which can attain different throughput and diversity gains. Then, this thesis extends the proposed JMIM design to three dimensions by combining it with the time domain. To circumvent the high detection complexity of the proposed CS-aided JMIM design, a large fraction of the overall computational complexity is relegated to the offline model training phase. Furthermore, we integrate the different communication tasks, such as CE, decoding and detection into a simple neural network model. Additionally, this thesis investigates the adaptive design of the proposed CS-aided JMIM system, where a learning-based adaptive modulation configuration method is applied. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CS-aided JMIM (CS-JMIM) is capable of outperforming its CS-aided separate-domain MIM counterpart. Furthermore, the learning-aided adaptive scheme is capable of increasing the throughput while maintaining the required error probability target.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Computational modelling of modern battery material interfaces","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489888/","Julian Oliver Holland","March 2024","Material interface simulations often require electronic-level accuracy to deliver meaningful results. \cite{sutton_interfaces_1996}. However, interfaces for the complex systems observed in batteries often require larger simulation sizes than can be simulated to this level of accuracy. This work aims to provide electron-level chemical information, through leveraging the recent innovations of linear-scaling density functional theory over the last decade with the ever-increasing scale of computational resources available to us, about previously inaccessibly large battery interfaces. Li intercalation is one of the most fundamental mechanisms that occur in a Li-ion battery. Providing an electronic-level resolution of this process could significantly enhance the rational design of electrodes. We present an electrostatically-driven workflow that seeks to emulate the charging process for an anode. This workflow proceeds by selecting intercalation sites within a material using the global electrostatic minimum calculated using density functional theory (DFT). This methodology is applied to a high surface area to volume ratio structure in order to better investigate the anodic interface. The structure we select is a 592-atom graphite nanoparticle. We are able to simulate the charging of this large structure with electronic-level accuracy by using linear-scaling DFT methods which allow for the calculation of far larger systems than conventional DFT. The results of our application showed how several experimentally observed features of graphitic intercalation are retained in an unparameterised manner, lending to the quality of our selected methodologies. We observe Li staging, Li to C charge transfer, and the formation of an OCV-like voltage step profile using a convex-hull formalism. We also demonstrate the importance of the role of the interface in large structural shifts. Specifically, how Li accumulation at the edges can hamper the typical graphite transition from the AB to AA polymorphs with increasing Li content. Moving towards the other side of this interface, we present work on the solid electrolyte material Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ (LLZO). cubic LLZO's (c-LLZO) exact structure has not been able to be established through experiment or simulation. This problem is essential to resolve as the ground state structure of c-LLZO is required before performing more complex atomistic investigations. By implementing a three-stage methodology of generation, symmetry checking, and energetic ordering we have been able to reduce the vast configuration space of c-LLZO (\(7.4\times 10^{34}\) structures) to just four crystallographically predicted structures. This is achieved by implementing a restriction that no Li atom may be within 1.7 \si{\angstrom} of each other. By considering this geometrical constraint we also determine that a large portion of previously reported structures may not be feasible or stable. We further reduce our configuration space by developing a symmetry checking technique capable of handling over \(1\times 10^8\) structures. Finally, we conclude by energetically ordering our symmetrically unique structure with a machine learning-based energetic calculator that was able to reproduce DFT energetic ordering with 99.96\% accuracy. The data set of our produced structures is freely accessible to all with the aim of improving the accuracy and reproducibility of future LLZO research. To expand the utility of our efforts made in our c-LLZO research we move towards simulation of the entire Li|LLZO interface, featuring a tetragonal LLZO (t-LLZO) interphase. One of the major obstacles in including the solid-state electrolyte LLZO in modern battery packs is the formation of dendrites at the Li|LLZO interface. Experimentally, such interfaces are challenging to probe. This provides a niche in which theory can deliver insights. In this work, we present the progress we have made towards simulating the Li|t-LLZO interface using linear-scaling DFT and high-accuracy surface energies. We also present a methodology to compute the configuration space structures necessary for thoroughly sampling solid-state interfaces which we apply to the system in question and find a minimum, well-sampled, configuration space of \(1.04\times10^7\) structures. To get to this number we find all possible Miller plane combinations, find all possible t-LLZO cuts, create a scheme for sampling inter-slab translations, provide a methodology for finding low-strain commensurate interfaces, and present the results of large-scale DFT calculations on the Li|t-LLZO interface that find a reasonable inter-slab distance value. Finally, having established our configuration space, we present our efforts towards the creation of density functional tight-binding Slater-Koster libraries specific to LLZO. During the process, we demonstrate a general workflow for solid-state systems. We find that our Slater-Koster libraries are able to reproduce DFT values for the total electronic density of states at the Fermi level of bulk t-LLZO. However, further parameterisation is required in order to apply these libraries to Li|LLZO interfaces, particularly the Li-O element-pair interaction.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Uhm; Mishka Terplan; Julia M.A. Sinclair; Roberta Agabio","29 April 2024","Background: despite the known harms, alcohol consumption is common in pregnancy. Rates vary between countries, and are estimated to be 10% globally, with up to 25% in Europe.Objectives: to assess the efficacy of psychosocial interventions and medications to reduce or stop alcohol consumption during pregnancy.Search methods: we searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (via CRSLive), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO, from inception to 8 January 2024. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and included studies.Selection criteria: we included randomised controlled trials that compared medications or psychosocial interventions, or both, to placebo, no intervention, usual care, or other medications or psychosocial interventions used to reduce or stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Our primary outcomes of interest were abstinence from alcohol, reduction in alcohol consumption, retention in treatment, and women with any adverse event.Data collection and analysis: we used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.Main results: we included eight studies (1369 participants) in which pregnant women received an intervention to stop or reduce alcohol use during pregnancy. In one study, almost half of participants had a current diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD); in another study, 40% of participants had a lifetime diagnosis of AUD. Six studies took place in the USA, one in Spain, and one in the Netherlands. All included studies evaluated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions; we did not find any study that evaluated the efficacy of medications for the treatment of AUD during pregnancy. Psychosocial interventions were mainly brief interventions ranging from a single session of 10 to 60 minutes to five sessions of 10 minutes each. Pregnant women received the psychosocial intervention approximately at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, and the outcome of alcohol use was reassessed 8 to 24 weeks after the psychosocial intervention. Women in the control group received treatment as usual (TAU) or similar treatments such as comprehensive assessment of alcohol use and advice to stop drinking during pregnancy. Globally, we found that, compared to TAU, psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuously abstinent participants (risk ratio (RR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.57; I2 =0%; 3 studies; 378 women; low certainty evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on the number of drinks per day, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference -0.42, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.28; I2 = 86%; 2 studies; 157 women; very low certainty evidence). Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on the number of women who completed treatment (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02; I2 = 0%; 7 studies; 1283 women; moderate certainty evidence). None of the included studies assessed adverse events of treatments. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision of the estimates.Authors' conclusions: brief psychosocial interventions may increase the rate of continuous abstinence among pregnant women who report alcohol use during pregnancy. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of psychosocial interventions and other treatments (e.g. medications) for women with AUD. These studies should provide detailed information on alcohol use before and during pregnancy using consistent measures such as the number of drinks per drinking day. When heterogeneous populations are recruited, more detailed information on alcohol use during pregnancy should be provided to allow future systematic reviews to be conducted. Other important information that would enhance the usefulness of these studies would be the presence of other comorbid conditions such as anxiety, mood disorders, and the use of other psychoactive substances.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Digital health technologies in improving efficiency in reproductive medicine","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489751/","Isla Robertson","29 April 2024","In this thesis, the potential for digital health technologies to improve efficiency in reproductive medicine is explored. An efficient clinical system is one achieving high levels of performance (outcomes) relative to the inputs (resources, time, money) consumed. The primary goals of reproductive medical care are, where possible, to achieve a healthy live birth and, if this is not possible, to sustain the psychological wellbeing of those with an unfulfilled child wish. More efficient care would achieve these goals with reduced practical and psychological burden on patients, lower costs, and optimal use of resources.To provide an understanding of the landscape of digital tools in reproductive medicine, this thesis starts with a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing digital support tools. Although digital tools for use alongside fertility treatment have been developed, few are supported by research evidence. The work identified that the small number of digital support tools that have been evaluated in randomised trials overall have a small positive impact on pregnancy rates, but no significant impact on psychological outcomes.The thesis proceeds to address two aspects of the way in which the burden of treatment can potentially be reduced for patients, firstly through emotional and psychological support by means of an emotional support app (MediEmo) and secondly, through streamlining clinical processes using machine learning and algorithms to develop digital health interventions.Digital tools could help empower patients through reduction of IVF treatment burden, thereby reducing treatment dropout, the latter being a significant problem in the fertility treatment journey. One way of reducing treatment burden is by reducing the emotional strain of treatment and this thesis explores the use of a novel app MediEmo in doing just that. MediEmo is a smartphone app designed to provide practical and psychological support to patients during IVF treatment. A 3-year descriptive evaluation study demonstrated high engagement and usage of the app, with 80% of eligible patients entering app data. MediEmo was found to be a sensitive tool to examine the emotional experiences of patients during IVF treatment, indicating the emotional intensity of treatment cycles, particularly the two-week wait prior to pregnancy test. In addition, MediEmo data revealed that elevated levels of negative emotions are also experienced during both intrauterine insemination and frozen embryo transfer cycles and that more support may be required for patients undertaking these treatments. Furthermore, the observational study of rates of return for more IVF treatment within 1 year of a failed IVF cycle found that active app usage was associated with a higher rate of return for further treatment within one year of cycle failure compared to non-users of the app. A higher rate of return could, in theory, improve the chances of pregnancy via cumulative success. Further work planned to test this hypothesis is described.Development of new algorithms has led to considerable research and clinical interest in using machine learning to develop smart digital health interventions. The latter part of this thesis explores applications of these techniques aiming to develop digital tools for use in clinical reproductive medicine. A retrospective study using machine learning aimed to optimise timing of the trigger injection during an IVF stimulation cycle. After this work proved unsuccessful, similar techniques were used to address the need for frequent transvaginal ultrasound monitoring of ovarian follicular growth. This monitoring is an onerous and invasive aspect of fertility treatments, that is traditionally performed, but the frequency of this intervention lacks evidence to support efficiency. Models were developed to predict key variables in an IVF cycle using data from scans on single days. The results identified that ultrasound scans are most useful between day 8 and 10 of an IVF cycle, when accurate predictions of oocyte maturation trigger day, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) risk, can be made. With further work, it may be possible to omit the less useful earlier scans, particularly in circumstances such as the Covid pandemic and the resulting need for social distancing. The development of algorithms to improve mid-cycle communication with patients is also summarised.Digital health technologies will play an increasing role in reproductive medicine. This thesis demonstrates this emerging contribution via two specific aspects aiming to reduce patient and clinical treatment burden: 1) emotional support by way of a digital app and 2) utilising advanced analytics in streamlining clinical processes. However, any new digital tools in fertility care must be robustly evaluated to show they truly improve efficiency. The tools should then be tested in the ‘real-world’ and the thesis concludes by considering how this field of work could develop in the future.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Nonlinear models for mixture experiments including process variables","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489649/","Shroug Abdullah S Alzahrani","28 April 2024","Mixture experiments are applied in a variety of fields, for example, food processing, chemical engineering, and product quality improvement. All these examples have in common that they rely on experiments that mix multiple components. In mixture experiments, the measured response is a function not of the amount of the mixture components but their proportions. This adds a layer of complexity to the modeling of such experiments. In some mixture experiments, the blending properties of the mixture may be affected by the processing conditions, such as temperature and pressure, besides the mixture components’ proportions. Such types of mixture experiments are known as mixture-process variables experiments. This present work is concerned with finding and assessing a class of models that flexibly fits data from mixture experiments and mixture-process variables experiments, and with providing guidelines for how to design mixture experiments and mixture-process variables experiments when these models are fitted. Most models in the literature are either based on polynomials and are therefore not very flexible, or have a large number of parameters that make the response surface interpretation difficult to understand. The modified fractional polynomial models are a recent class of models from the literature that are flexible and parsimonious but quite restrictive. We contribute to mixture experiments by proposing a new class of nonlinear models, the complement mixture fractional polynomial (CMFP) models, by making an additional transformation of the fractional polynomial, which results in less restrictive models while retaining (and indeed exceeding) the advantages of this class. Moreover, we suggest an extended form for the modified fractional polynomial models to fit data from mixture-process variables experiments. A further main concern of this thesis is to optimize the response by finding the optimal combinations of proportions of the mixture components. Therefore, we found the maximum response by determining the corresponding proportions of the mixture components that achieved this. We conducted a simulation study in which we evaluated the performance of the CMFP models and compared them with different models from the literature. An efficient design can greatly improve the analysis of an experiment. We constructed exact and near-optimal mixture designs in constrained experimental regions for CMFP models with respect to the D-optimal criteria. Comparisons between the obtained designs in terms of their efficiency and robustness assessment are illustrated with several examples.","Tech","University of Southampton"

The results demonstrated consistent breakthrough curves during redox cycles, confirming the chemical stability of the material. In 10 consecutive cycles at 600 °C and 1 bar, bed temperatures increased by 184 °C and 132 °C across the bed during oxidation and reduction stages respectively. The cooling effects during RWGS showed a decline in solid temperatures demonstrating the effectiveness of the heat removal strategy while attaining a CO2-to-CO conversion close >48%. The outlet gas maintains a H2/CO ratio above 2, confirming the material's dual role as OC and catalyst. During complete CL-RWGS cycles, varying temperature from 500 °C to 600 °C at a constant H2/CO2 molar ratio (1.3) and pressure (1 bar) reduces the H2/CO molar ratio from 3.14 to 2.35, respectively with a remarkable continuous CO2-to-CO conversion > 40%. The decrease in H2/CO molar ratio with the increase in temperature is consistent with the expected results of equilibrium limited conditions. Additionally, in CL-RWGS cycles, pressure insignificantly affects product molar composition. The study showed the capability of Cu material in converting CO2 into syngas through the CL-RWGS technique.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Localization in reconfigurable intelligent surface aided mmWave systems: a multiple measurement vector based channel estimation method","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489286/","Kunlun Li; Mohammed El-Hajjar; Lie-Liang Yang; Jiguang He","15 April 2024","The sparsity of millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the angular and temporal domains is beneficial to channel estimation, while the associated channel parameters can be utilized for localization. However, line-of-sight (LoS) blockage poses a significant challenge on the localization in mmWave systems, potentially leading to substantial positioning errors. A promising solution is to employ reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to generate the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) paths to aid localization. Consequently, wireless localization in the RIS assisted mmWave systems has become the essential research issue. In this paper, a multiple measurement vector (MMV) model is constructed and a two-stage channel estimation based localization scheme is proposed. During the first stage, by exploiting the beamspace sparsity and employing a random RIS phase shift matrix, the channel parameters are estimated, based on which the precoder at base station and combiner at user equipment (UE) are designed. Then, in the second stage, based on the designed precoding and combining matrices, the optimal phase shift matrix for RIS is designed using the proposed modified temporally correlated multiple sparse Bayesian learning (TMSBL) algorithm. Afterwards, the channel parameters, such as angle of reflection, time-of-arrival, etc., embedding location information are estimated for finally deriving the location of UE. We demonstrate the achievable performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our studies show that the proposed localization scheme is capable of achieving centimeter level localization accuracy, when LoS path is blocked. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has a low computational complexity and outperforms the legacy algorithms in different perspectives.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Without expensive and fixed base stations, WMN can be established fast, easily, and flexibly with low cost. With the fast development of wireless communication, the required data rate and amount increase. As WMN can always provide broad communication access with better scalability, flexibility, and robustness, WMN can still play an important role in future and can bring a wide range of applications in next-generation communication. From the beginning till now, the focus of WMN transfers from sparse connection to intelligent dense networking. The wireless network in future will be more complex with different demands. Considering the features of WMN, this paper provides an overview of WMN from the point of view of next-generation communication. The application scenes including space-air-ground integrated network, Internet of Things, and edge computing are provided. When deploying WMN, the technologies suitable for the demands in next-generation communication, such as blockchain, software defined networking, network functions virtualization, and machine learning are discussed.

Meadows","19 March 2024","Understanding the transient dynamics of interlinked social–ecological systems (SES) is imperative for assessing sustainability in the Anthropocene. However, how to identify critical transitions in real-world SES remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present an evolutionary framework to characterize these dynamics over an extended historical timeline. Our approach leverages multidecadal rates of change in socioeconomic data, paleoenvironmental, and cutting-edge sedimentary ancient DNA records from China’s Yangtze River Delta, one of the most densely populated and intensively modified landscapes on Earth. Our analysis reveals two significant social–ecological transitions characterized by contrasting interactions and feedback spanning several centuries. Initially, the regional SES exhibited a loosely connected and ecologically sustainable regime. Nevertheless, starting in the 1950s, an increasingly interconnected regime emerged, ultimately resulting in the crossing of tipping points and an unprecedented acceleration in soil erosion, water eutrophication, and ecosystem degradation. Remarkably, the second transition occurring around the 2000s, featured a notable decoupling of socioeconomic development from ecoenvironmental degradation. This decoupling phenomenon signifies a more desirable reconfiguration of the regional SES, furnishing essential insights not only for the Yangtze River Basin but also for regions worldwide grappling with similar sustainability challenges. Our extensive multidecadal empirical investigation underscores the value of coevolutionary approaches in understanding and addressing social–ecological system dynamics.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Stories in the dust: the arts as a medium to communicate climate science","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489285/","Ian Williams; Anna Harriott; Iona Johnson","23 April 2024","Modern society urgently needs to address dangerous climate change. This is hugely challenging and requires active public engagement. Many political, environmental, social, technological, legal, and economic approaches have been trialled, but only slow progress has been achieved. Scientists universally face considerable difficulties in communicating research findings to the public in an effective manner. Historically, scientific communication has focused on public education and raising awareness. However, recent studies have highlighted that ideology, not knowledge, best predicts environment-related attitudes and behaviour and hence emotion-based approaches are being tested. This paper provides an overview of techniques used for scientific communication and makes the case that new, more impactful methods are necessary. We outline an interdisciplinary approach that combines science and theatre to generate a co-created show that applies intergenerational influence combined with emotional responses and personification to help promote pro-environmental attitudes and behaviours. Stories in the Dust (SITD) is a theatre show for ages 5-12 with themes of climate change, displacement, and hope. SITD was initially devised by two actors who tested the show concept, receiving positive feedback from research & development period in partnership with a primary school and a university professor who acted as a scientific and educational consultant to engage participants & develop show/wraparound content. The show went on tour October to November 2023, with pictures, reviews, and resources available on a dedicated website. Reflections on the approach detail what worked well, what challenges were faced, how practice could be replicated elsewhere, how innovations may be sustained, and future aspirations and plans. The SITD team’s plan is to provide entertaining and thought-provoking theatre shows that provide employment for the arts community as well as improving the way that scientists engage in scientific communication.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Two-dimensional direction-of-arrival estimation using stacked intelligent metasurfaces","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489843/","Jiancheng An; Chau Yuen; Yong Liang Guan","19 April 2024","Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) are capable of emulating reconfigurable physical neural networks by relying on electromagnetic (EM) waves as carriers. They can also perform various complex computational and signal processing tasks. A SIM is constructed by densely integrating multiple metasurface layers, each consisting of a large number of small meta-atoms that can control the EM waves passing through it. In this paper, we harness a SIM for two-dimensional (2D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. In contrast to the conventional designs, an advanced SIM in front of the receiver array automatically carries out the 2D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as the incident waves propagate through it. As a result, the receiver array directly observes the angular spectrum of the incoming signal. In this context, the DOA estimates can be readily obtained by using probes to detect the energy distribution on the receiver array. This avoids the need for power-thirsty radio frequency (RF) chains. To enable SIM to perform the 2D DFT, we formulate the optimization problem of minimizing the fitting error between the SIM’s EM response and the 2D DFT matrix. Furthermore, a gradient descent algorithm is customized for iteratively updating the phase shift of each meta-atom in SIM. To further improve the DOA estimation accuracy, we configure the phase shift pattern inthe zeroth layer of the SIM to generate a set of 2D DFT matrices associated with orthogonal spatial frequency bins. Additionally, we analytically evaluate the performance of the proposed SIMbased DOA estimator by deriving a tight upper bound for the mean square error (MSE). Our numerical simulations verify the capability of a well-trained SIM to perform DOA estimation and corroborate our theoretical analysis. It is demonstrated that a SIM having an optical computational speed achieves an MSE of 10-4for DOA estimation.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Brown; Pablo Escobar-Flores; Rochelle Constantine; Richard L. O’Driscoll; Mike Double; Nick Gales; Simon Childerhouse; Matthew H. Pinkerton","13 June 2023","Southern Ocean humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae are capital breeders, breeding in the warm tropics/subtropics in the winter and migrating to nutrient-rich Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer. The classic feeding model is for the species to fast while migrating and breeding, surviving on blubber energy stores. Whilst northern hemisphere humpback whales are generalists, southern hemisphere counterparts are perceived as krill specialists, but for many populations, uncertainties remain regarding their diet and preferred feeding locations. This study used bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses and isoscape-based feeding location assignments to assess the diet, trophic ecology and likely feeding areas of humpback whales sampled in the Ross Sea region and around the Balleny Islands. Sampled whales had a mixed diet of plankton, krill and fish, similar to the diet of northern hemisphere humpback whales. Proportions of fish consumed varied but were often high (2-60%), thus challenging the widely held paradigm of Southern Ocean humpback whales being exclusive krill feeders. These whales had lower δ15N values and trophic position estimates than their northern hemisphere counterparts, likely due to lower Southern Ocean baseline δ15N surface water values and a lower percentage consumption of fish, respectively. Most whales fed in the Ross Sea shelf/slope and Balleny Islands high-productivity regions, but some isotopically distinct whales (mostly males) fed at higher trophic levels either around the Balleny Islands and frontal upwelling areas to the north, or en route to Antarctica in temperate waters off southern Australia and New Zealand. These results support other observations of humpback whales feeding during migration, highlighting the species' dietary plasticity, which may increase their foraging and breeding success and provide them with greater resilience to anthropogenically mediated ecological change. This study highlights the importance of combining in situ field data with regional-scale isoscapes to reliably assess trophic structure and animal feeding locations, and to better inform ecosystem conservation and management of marine protected areas.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Calibrating families: data behaviourism and the new algorithmic logic","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489281/","Rosalind Edwards; Val Gillies; Helene Vannier Ducasse","17 April 2024","Family intervention is a long-established mechanism of state control, but recent technological developments are facilitating new regulatory capacities and objectives. This paper will explore how contemporary policy interventions in the UK are converging around a technological solutionist ideology that centres family relationships as core instruments of social management. The last decade has seen a marked techno-administrative turn, with family state relationships increasingly mediated through online portals and dashboards. Over the last few years this data centric model has accelerated towards an algorithmic approach to governance through the incorporation of big data surveillance, predictive analytics and behavioural interventions to monitor and socially engineer populations. We trace the embedding of data collection frameworks into apparently conventional family intervention programs and show how this ‘datification’ was made into a core delivery tool. We also highlight how secrecy, or at the very least strategic silence, has restricted public knowledge of how and why data is being collected and used in the UK. We show how parents and children are being quantified and translated into data points to support new logics of choice manipulation, ceding unprecedented power to financiers, data analytic and social marketing companies, platform developers and big tech industries. This algorithmic calibration of children and parents is extending the regulatory powers of the state far beyond previous efforts to govern and control poor families with under explored consequences for principles of democracy and justice.","Tech","University of Southampton"

The e-textile is achieved by laminating a printed conductive pattern onto knitted fabric, followed by printing a carbon rubber electrode layer on top of the conductive pads of the conductive pattern. The Young’s modulus of two knitted stretchable fabrics, made of different textile yarns, is tested and their impact on the e-textile and garment properties is discussed. Four printed conductive track designs in the form of a straight line, a sine wave, a half circle, and a horseshoe are laminated on these fabrics. The four designs are investigated in terms of conductivity, change during stretching, relaxation after stretching, and wash durability. A snap connector, attached to each end of the conductive tracks, provides electronic interconnection. The e-textiles survive 100 wash cycles with a resultant maximum resistance increase of 1.44 times. A fitted knee sleeve, for use in wearable electrotherapy for knee joint pain management, is fabricated by laminating a conductive track in the optimal sinusoidal design and then printing carbon rubber electrodes on top.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Selectively closing recycling centers in Bavaria: Reforming waste‐management policy to reduce disparity","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489650/","Malena Schmidt; Bismark Singh","29 March 2024","Recycling centers sort and process collected waste in the interest of the environment, but also lead to damaging climate effects via released emissions and pollutants in their operation. Consequently, governments are closing such centers to fulfill climate and carbon neutrality goals. However, such closures risk populations being forced to travel further to facilities that collect waste, and can cause an unfair burden on the remaining open centers, thereby reducing participation in recycling. Using a facility location optimization model and mobility survey data within the state of Bavaria in Germany, we show how selective closures of these centers can still lead to high levels of recycling access. Our analysis ensures that even when 20% of facilities are closed smartly, the median travel distance by residents to their assigned recycling center increases by only 450 m. Additionally, we find Bavaria suffers from disparity in recycling patterns in rural and urban regions, both in terms of motivation to recycle and the locations of the facilities. We promote a policy that favors retention of recycling centers in rural regions by reserving 75% of open facilities to be in rural areas, while selectively closing facilities in urban regions, to remove these regional differences. Success of recycling campaigns depends on public perception of closures of such facilities and also on their ease of access. As policymakers gradually implement further closures, such data-driven strategies can assist in being more transparent to the public thereby increasing the willingness to participate in such recycling programs.","Tech","University of Southampton"

We split this difficult problem into its constituent components, self-supervised keypoint detection to find two-dimensional keypoints from images, and self-supervised pose lifting to infer the depth of those points. We frame this problem as a representation learning problem, where keypoints are a spatially constrained representation, and also consider the semantic properties of keypoints when applied to different use cases. We consider how priors are used to resolve an ill posed problem such as this, before devising a new prior which leverages the rigidity of limbs found in most articulated objects to both locate better keypoints and to improve the lifting of keypoints. We conclude by describing the wider applicability outside of this specifc approach, and suggest future work that logically follows on from this thesis.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Exploring the relationship between sea ice and phytoplankton growth in the Weddell Gyre using satellite and Argo float data","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/487936/","Clara Celestine Douglas; Nathan Briggs; Peter Brown; Graeme Macgilchrist; Alberto Naveira Garabato","20 January 2024","Some of the highest rates of primary production across the Southern Ocean occur in the seasonal ice zone (SIZ), making this a prominent area of importance for both local ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. There, the annual advance and retreat of ice impacts light and nutrient availability, as well as the circulation and stratification, thereby imposing a dominant control on phytoplankton growth. In this study, the drivers of variability in phytoplankton growth between 2002–2020 in the Weddell Gyre SIZ were assessed using satellite net primary production (NPP) products alongside chlorophyll-a and particulate organic carbon (POC) data from autonomous biogeochemical floats. Although the highest daily rates of NPP are consistently observed in the continental shelf region (water depths shallower than 2000 m), the open-ocean region’s larger size and longer ice-free season mean that it dominates biological carbon uptake within the Weddell Gyre, accounting for 93 %–96 % of the basin’s total annual NPP. Variability in the summer maximum ice-free area is the strongest predictor of inter-annual variability in total NPP across the Weddell Gyre, with greater ice-free area resulting in greater annual NPP, explaining nearly half of the variance (R2 = 42 %). In the shelf region, the return of sea ice cover controls the end of the productive season. In the open ocean, however, both satellite NPP and float data show that a decline in NPP occurs before the end of the ice-free season (∼ 80 to 130 d after sea ice retreat). Evidence of concurrent increases in float-observed chlorophyll-a and POC suggest that later in the summer season additional factors such as micro-nutrient availability or top-down controls (e.g. grazing) could be limiting NPP. These results indicate that in a warmer and more ice-free Weddell Gyre, notwithstanding compensating changes in nutrient supply, NPP is likely to be enhanced only up to a certain limit of ice-free days.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Carminati","27 March 2024","Background and Aims: Climate change is happening and causing severe impact on the sustainability of agroecosystems. We argue that many of the abiotic stresses associated with climate change will be most acutely perceived by the plant at the root-soil interface and are likely to be mitigated at this globally important interface. In this review we will focus on the direct impacts of climate change, temperature, drought and pCO2, on roots and rhizospheres. Methods and Results: We consider which belowground traits will be impacted and discuss the potential for monitoring and quantifying these traits for modelling and breeding programs. We discuss the specific impacts of combined stress and the role of the microbial communities populating the root-soil interface, collectively referred to as the rhizosphere microbiota, in interactions with roots under stress and discuss the plastic responses to stress as a way of adapting plants to climate change. We then go on to discuss the role that modelling has in understanding this complex problem and suggest the best belowground targets for adaptation and mitigation to climate change. We finish by considering where the main uncertainties lie, providing perspective on where research is needed. Conclusion: This review therefore focuses on the potential of roots and rhizosphere to adapt to climate change effects and to mitigate their negative impacts on plant growth, crop productivity, soil health and ecosystem services.","Tech","University of Southampton"

For CMV elimination, a new coordinate system that looks like the cropped version of the original abc frame is proposed, by which zero CMV can be ensured when the identified switching states are transformed from the new frame back into the original one. For SFM, a new approach is proposed to determine the optimal switching sequence, where a voltage reference point dwell mechanism is introduced such that the number of switching actions between adjacent switching periods is minimized by establishing its relationship with a unique variable, namely the number of level shifts. Furthermore, these two objectives can either be implemented independently or in combination to achieve SFM under the premise of CMV elimination, thus allowing the converter's redundancy to be fully exploited. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed strategies.","Tech","University of Southampton"

We apply the rules to synthesise cages with well-defined cavities, supported by evidence from crystallography, spectroscopy and modelling. Access to low-symmetry, self-assembled organic cages such as those presented, will widen the current bottleneck preventing study of organic enzyme mimics, and provide synthetic tools for novel functional material design.","Tech","University of Southampton"

The article uses qualitative content analysis to examine journalistic coverage, promotional and presentation activities, exhibitions and performances, and social media postings over a four-year period from Ai-Da’s first launch to international visibility. The analysis shows how Ai-Da is positioned as a high-profile, border crossing artist, engaging in debates about Artificial Intelligence (AI), art, and the environment. It considers the creative assemblage of Ai-Da as a humanoid robot artist, the creator Aidan Meller and the team working with him, and the wider contextual factors of aesthetic expertise, networks and knowledge of art worlds which have shaped Ai-Da's artistic identity and career trajectory. The focus on how Ai-Da signals expertise on social media helps to frame the specific techniques used to speak about and for Ai-Da on social media platforms and wider media coverage. This includes articulating inspiration, showcasing artistic processes and cultivating audience relationships. In concluding, the implications of connecting critical perspectives on creative work with developments in art, AI and robot artists are explored: firstly, for understanding how the practices for constructing an artistic identity shape the development of robot artists; secondly, for understanding how developments in art and AI can frame reflections on artistic identity and careers.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Supercontinuum and frequency comb generation in tantalum pentoxide waveguides","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489557/","Jake Daykin","April 2024","In this thesis, the design, simulation, fabrication, and characterisation of tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) waveguides and micro-resonators on silicon substrates is presented as a potential technology for the generation of supercontinuum and Kerr frequency combs. Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers and membrane external-cavity surface emitting lasers that operate on two frequencies simultaneously are shown for the purposes of either acting as pump sources for the waveguide systems or as sources for generating THz radiation through the beat between the two frequencies. The fabrication process of the Ta2O5waveguides is discussed in detail, including the relevant fabrication parameters. The Ta2O5layer is deposited using radio-frequency (RF) sputtering onto a 4 ” diameter silicon wafer, with a 5 µm thick layer of thermal silica on the top surface, using a Ta2O5powder target. The waveguide and micro-ring structures are realised using photolithography and ion beam milling, and the samples are cladded with a layer of silica using either RF sputtering or plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition with a liquid precursor.  Linear waveguides in Ta2O5are presented for the purpose of generating supercontinuum; Experimental outputs from linear Ta2O5waveguides for a range of pump wavelengths from 900 to 1500 nm are reported with hundreds of nm of spectral broadening being seen for each pump wavelength. The expected spectral broadening emission of the waveguides is shown, which is calculated using a generalised nonlinear Schrodinger equation (GNSLE) solver that is capable of solving for multiple modes. The GNLSE solver is used to estimate which mode is propagating through the waveguide. The propagation losses of linear waveguides, including an investigation into the impact of waveguide width and cladding deposition technique, are presented, with the lowest propagation loss reported to be on the order of 2.5 dB/cm. The dispersion engineering for new Ta2O5linear waveguide samples is shown with a focus on the waveguide geometry, leading to the finalisation of a waveguide design that corresponds to the optimised dispersion relation for nonlinear broadening. Micro-ring and racetrack resonators are presented for the purpose of generating Kerr frequency combs. The dispersion relations for micro-resonators are calculated and compared to that of linear waveguides, this followed by an investigation into the critical coupling lengths of micro-ring resonators. Racetrack resonator systems are presented as a suitable alternative to micro-ring resonators due to the fact that the critical coupling lengths are larger than the micro-ring geometries. A Lugiato-Lefever equation solver, based on the GNSLE solver, is described and confirmed against the literature, and is used to simulate the expected frequency comb emission from the Ta2O5micro-resonators. A brief investigation into the effect of propagation loss on the comb generation is presented using the LLE solver. Experimental Q-factor measurements are presented for Ta2O5micro-ring and racetrack resonators with the highest Q-factor being 1.91×10^5. Frequency comb generation was not observed, this is expected to be due to the propagation losses being too high. Finally, vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers and membrane external-cavity surface-emitting lasers operating simultaneously on two distinct spatial modes, and therefore two distinct frequencies, are reported. The laser systems are forced to operate on two modes simultaneously through the inclusion of laser ablated masks on an intracavity high reflectivity mirror that introduces spatially dependent losses on the cavity modes in order to suppress the lasing threshold of the fundamental Hermite Gaussian, HG00, mode and allow the higher order, HG11, mode to operate. Simulated mode losses are calculated, and the lasers are characterised for a range of spatially dependent loss values and pump powers. The spectral emissions of the lasers are shown, with wavelength separations on the order of 5 nm, which corresponds to a beat frequency of 1.41 THz. These laser technologies also represent an exciting potential pump laser system for the micro-resonators with the aim of generating a Kerr frequency comb.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"Resilient communications for underwater systems","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/488943/","Alexander James Beaumont Hamilton","February 2024","In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital communications that defines our contemporary world, the imperative for resilient, secure, and distributed wireless systems has never been more crucial. Within the specific context of defence and security operations, the critical role of resilient, secure, and distributed wireless communications in fostering optimal situational awareness and facilitating information exchange cannot be overstated. This thesis introduces innovative novel approaches and solutions to address the intricate technical challenges inherent in tactical communications. These challenges are particularly pronounced in scenarios such as urban deployments or underwater acoustic communications. The diverse techniques presented in this work include a pioneering Joint Source Channel Coding scheme, a novel Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR)-based signal processing demodulation technique for M-ary Orthogonal Signalling, novel turbo-equalization techniques tailored to a NATO standard, integrated security within a high-performance physical layer for underwater communications, and pioneering approaches to the integration of communications and autonomy. These advancements ensure optimal resource utilisation while minimising environmental and operational impact. The robustness of several of the proposed solutions is evaluated through analysis and implementations in relevant scenario simulations. Real-world applicability and performance metrics are considered to validate the efficacy of the methodologies developed and their ultimate integration within existing defence and security frameworks.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Endometriosis – It’s influence on obstetric and birth outcomes and the potential role of reactive oxygen species","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489101/","Joanne Marie Horton","April 2024","The gynaecological conditions of endometriosis and adenomyosis are believed to affect up to 10% of women of child-bearing age in the UK and can cause debilitating pain, infertility and significant burden on healthcare economics. Many important aspects of the pathogenesis and health impacts of the diseases remain elusive. One more recently discovered culprit is that of reactive oxygen species which has been linked not only to the pathogenic process but also to progression of the diseases and their impact on both pain and fertility. Reactive oxygen species are difficult to measure and study in vivo and their relationship with endometriosis therefore remains undetermined. What remains lacking in our knowledge of two prevalent and debilitating diseases is a full understanding of the pathogenesis and disease progression, how they cause pain and infertility, how they impact on pregnancy and health of any offspring and a reliable non-invasive test and effective treatment. Reactive oxygen species may play a key role across all of these themes. This thesis sets out to investigate 1) the influence of endometriosis on the reproductive process from fertility parameters to perinatal outcomes and explore a possible role of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease theory in women with the disease 2) whether reactive oxygen species levels are different in women with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis and whether levels of reactive oxygen species are improved following surgical treatment of disease and 3) how reactive oxygen species affect the oocyte using a reproductive fluid of women affected by endometriosis in an ethically approved human study and murine model.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Dust sources to the Arabian Sea and their record of continental hydroclimate","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489660/","Terezia Kunkelova","April 2024","Mineral dust plays an important role in Earth’s climate as it affects radiation budgets, regional hydroclimates and provides nutrients to the Arabian Sea and further afield. Dust accumulating in deep sea sediment has the potential to provide long uninterrupted records of past changes in hydroclimate. However, to read these records properly it is important to be able to trace these dust deposits to their origin. Dust records from the Arabian Sea have long been used to reconstruct past changes in continental hydroclimate. However, this ocean basin is encircled by many arid and dust-producing regions and its dust record has been variously attributed to East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia and further east into southwest Asia. This thesis is composed of three main inter-related studies. In the first, I use geochemical methods (Sr and Nd isotopes) to fingerprint major dust producing regions on the Arabian Peninsula and southwest Asia and distinguish them from those of Africa. In the second, I employ high-resolution remote sensing observations over a four-year interval to map dust activation frequency in the Horn of Africa. Lastly, I report the results of a dust-based palaeo study of hydroclimate change from the western Arabian Sea covering the middle Pliocene and late Quaternary.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Steps towards mixed energy optimisation of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489263/","Laminn McLay","April 2024","The long-range uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to utilise a combination of power sources, including photovoltaic modules, fuel cells, or direct combustion with hydrogen, lithium compound batteries, and hydrocarbon fuels. Hybrid powertrains are becoming more common, highlighting the need for automated powertrain topological exploration to identify the optimal design for mission performance. In this thesis, we develop tools to identify such optimal designs. The first building block of such an optimiser is a scheme capable of the flexible, futureproof, yet economical encoding of powertrain topologies, and we propose such a scheme in this thesis. This scheme is adaptable for analysis and can be applied to any UAV powertrain topology, providing a means to compare and analyse different powertrains. The second building block of the optimisation process is determining the optimal energy architecture. To achieve this, we use a point mass model to represent the aircraft performance, the energy components are modelled and the different powertrain topologies are evaluated through dynamically generated strings, based on the proposed encoding scheme. The point mass model can be used to evaluate different powertrain topologies for fixed-wing UAVs through the initial value problem (IVP) by simulating the dynamics of the UAV’s motion over time. By simulating the UAV’s motion over time, the model can provide insights into the energy consumption and other performance metrics of different powertrain topologies. We compare two different fixed wing UAV models: a 5 kg maximum take-off mass with a 2mwing span and a 25 kg maximum take-off mass with a 4mwing span UAV; for set missions with different powertrains. Overall, we demonstrate that the framework proposed here delivers the lightest feasible powertrain topologies, describing the power supply as well as the preliminary flight profile for a specific platform for a given operation whilst developing a scheme that is suitable for embedding various topology strings with capability for a wide variety of multi-source and multi sink power systems. The proposed framework allows for refining the mission profile, minimising powertrain sizing, and finding an optimal energy split for hybrid powertrain topologies through novel powertrain topology parameterisation.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Multi-disciplinary design optimization of heat exchangers using Gaussian processes","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489157/","Atul Udaivir Singh","April 2024","Heat exchangers are important equipment in many engineering systems. They are equally complex and resource-intensive to design and manufacture, requiring several hours of both simulation and experimentation budget before reaching a design freeze. Various configurations within the sub-components or their designs make the design process even more challenging, as each of those variants will require respective analysis before reaching an optimal design. The literature also reveals that such analysis are often done in isolation and not in an integrated fashion. The first aim of this work is to perform a multi-disciplinary optimization of a charge air cooler that allows us to tweak several of its design properties within the framework, as they are often necessary for design analysis. More specifically, the framework studies the impact of using corrugated tubes against smooth tubes within the multi-disciplinary framework, highlighting the importance of using such methods over traditional ones and allowing for improvement in resources required to reach a design freeze. The disciplines applied within this framework are aero-thermal and vibrations, making this approach the first of its kind in multi-disciplinary optimization for heat exchangers. Furthermore, another important component of the design process addressed in this work are the challenges posed by experimentation and the constraints it puts on the degree of freedom to explore the design space along with the time it takes to do so. This is done using surrogate-based approaches. Namely, Gaussian processes, multi-fidelity modeling, and multi-output Gaussian processes that are used to build prediction models that help swiftly explore new tube topologies (in this case, corrugated tubes), with much control and flexibility to explore the design space effectively. This work not only recommends how novel tube designs can be tested but also reduces the burden on the design process, which traditionally is resource intensive. The models constructed for tubes are then applied to a whole heat exchanger design process, providing another layer of performance for these models that cater to the entire heat exchanger design process. Lastly, an understanding about the reuse of data is formulated using multioutput Gaussian processes, where the chosen tube topologies are themselves utilized as source and target data sources. This allows us to assess when such topological decisions are helpful and when they are not.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"The role of insurance in regulating cyber risks in the shipping industry","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490720/","Feng Wang","April 2024","Cyber attack has become a pervasive issue in the shipping industry. It can steal sensitive and confidential data, cripple navigation and other technological systems on board and result in considerable damage to ships and shipping entities. The importance of the shipping industry in international trade means that cyber risk must be tackled. The shipping industry has recently begun to address this issue with the publication of guidelines from IMO and other private entities such as BIMCO. However, as argued in this chapter, these broad public organisational instruments and other non-binding private institutional guidelines are not enough to deal with contemporary cyber incidents properly. As evidenced in this chapter insurance also exerts a regulatory force over its subjects and acts as a form of governance beyond the state. This chapter will endeavour to explore the role of insurance as an effective risk management measure that can be taken against cyber risk in the shipping industry.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Blockchain application in recycling: from the supply chain perspective","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490844/","Shenghao Xie","March 2024","Recycling chains face evident challenges, including surging waste generation, insufficient recycling incentives and enforcement, fragmented traceability, and limited recycling network coordination. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the complex structures of multi-tier sustainable supply chains (MT-SSCM), where Blockchain technology (BCT) is often lauded as a potential ‘game-changer’. However, the transformative potential of BCT lacks empirical evidence, especially regarding how it can be effectively applied to recycling chains. The study commences with a comprehensive review of BCT functionalities, application drivers, technical feasibility, and potential performance. Subsequently, it employs a multiple-case study method to examine three companies that have successfully integrated BCT into their multi-tier recycling chains. Employing the Organisational Information Processing Theory (OIPT) as a framework, the study identifies three levels of information processing needs—firm, supply chain, and industry—and explores how BCT augments capabilities in transparency, immutability, integration, and trust. Additionally, the research delineates knowledge integration phases—transferring, translating, and transforming—while pinpointing visionary and structural boundary objects that facilitate this intricate process. This research stands as an early exploration into BCT application in the recycling sector, advancing the application of BCT in SSCM. It expands the body of knowledge by delineating a diverse multi-tier recycling framework. Theoretically, the study emphasises the critical role of information processing fit mechanisms, which are pivotal for enhancing performance in this domain. By employing a knowledge integration perspective, the research delineates how BCT can be effectively applied, thereby broadening the discourse on knowledge integration and the utility of boundary objects within recycling chains. The findings have been synthesised into a conceptual framework that incorporates the theoretical constructs of uncertainty in recycling chains, the capabilities enabled by BCT for information processing, and the mechanisms of knowledge integration. Practically, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners. It showcases a viable BCT-based recycling chain model that can aid practitioners in their pursuit of digital transformation towards sustainability. Additionally, it outlines further considerations for blockchain companies looking to pioneer feasible applications. For regulatory associations and other verification entities, BCT emerges as an invaluable tool to enhance supervision and trust.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Smart viscoelastic supports for vibration control in rotors","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/489035/","Azrul Abidin Zakaria","March 2023","One of the most important operating requirements of rotating machinery is the capability to operate away from its critical speeds. It can be achieved by associating a material that has property variation when induced by external stimuli. The focus of this work is the application of smart viscoelastic to the rotor dynamics field by employing magneto-rheological elastomer (MRE) as its support. Characterisation of MRE property is determined through impact hammer test with and without the presence of a magnetic field. The modulus of the MRE was estimated from the accelerance FRF plot and compared with the MRE model. The MRE model is based on the inter-particle interaction in the rubber matrix and linearised with the assumption of small displacement around the equilibrium position of the particle. The model of magnetic field-dependent behaviour is combined with the viscoelastic property of the MRE in a series configuration. The linearised MRE model was fairly accurate to estimate the data from the hammer test and experimental data from the literature. Then a rigid rotor model, supported by a flexible mount at both ends that consist of plain bearing with the linearised MRE model is considered. The MRE support is simulated with a three-parameter standard linear viscoelastic model with the inclusion of induced magnetic field property. The simulation results, which were limited to zero-field conditions, indicate that the use of MRE in conventional bearing supports can shift the critical speeds and reduce its corresponding vibration amplitude. These results suggest that the critical speed shift due to the increase of ferromagnetic particles in MRE can be explored further, especially with the influence of the induced magnetic field.","Tech","University of Southampton"

"High-performance and high-power applications of nested anti-resonant nodeless hollow-core fibres","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/488904/","Viktor Zuba","March 2024","The use of hollow-core fibres (HCFs) for transmitting high-power, high-brightness laser light presents significant advantages over the current standard technology based on solid core fibres (SCFs). HCFs can deliver much higher optical power levels over longer distances while maintaining a near single-moded beam-quality. This approach has already shown promising results, and this thesis presents important findings on highly efficient coupling and delivery of such laser beams, as well as a relevant application that takes advantage of the hollow core. The studies conducted in this thesis cover a range of subjects. Initially, the coupling tolerances of an in-house developed, state-of-the-art Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibre (NANF) were examined and quantified. This led to the experimental verification of the fundamental limits governing free-space coupling of a near-Gaussian beam into the fibre’s fundamental mode. Exploring the opportunity of utilizing high average power lasers, the inevitable thermal load on the optical elements responsible for the input coupling was analysed. The effect of thermal lensing induced by the laser light on the coupling optics led to the degradation of the beam-quality above a certain characteristic threshold (in our experiments ~100W). The studies showed that using a high-purity lens pair over commercially available alternatives significantly decreased this parasitic effect, resulting in more efficient transmission and reduced thermalisation. Additionally, thermal lensing also modified the input spatial beam distribution, resulting in an increased excitation of unwanted higher order modes. Coupling light into these modes that exhibit greater amount of leakage increases the temperature of the fibre noticeably. A non-invasive technique to extract the excess light not coupled into the fundamental mode was designed and implemented. The decreased thermal load on the fibre coating in turn also reduced the possibility of thermal damage, allowing the further scaling of the coupled optical power. Based on the findings, coupling efficiency values of ~95% into NANFs are achieved and maintained at high average powers. This allowed the demonstration of the record delivery of 1 kW average optical power through 1km of HCF. In addition, the implementation of the improvements mentioned above allowed an enhanced setup to couple 2 kW of average optical power stably, as well as to deliver it beyond 10m efficiently. The results achieved in this thesis are limited by the equipment available, and simulations indicate that further scaling in power and transmitted length should be possible. By combining the efficient methods to couple light into HCFs with the low attenuation offered by NANF technology, the Thesis also examines the optical propulsion of micron sized particles inside the hollow core of such fibres. Initial experiments demonstrate the guidance of 10 μm diameter particles through 1m of fibre orientable in any spatial direction. By further upscaling the power and fibre length, this preliminary set of experiments indicates the possibility of a remote sensing solution, which can take advantage of the preservation of the high-quality optical beam to trap the microparticles over extended fibre lengths. Furthermore, extrapolations of the measurement results suggest the possibility, in future work, of accelerating such particles beyond 100m/s in air-filled HCFs.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Knowledge and data dual-driven channel estimation and feedback for ultra-massive MIMO systems under hybrid field beam squint effect","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/487983/","Kuiyu Wang; Zhen Gao; Sheng Chen; Boyu Ning; Gaojie Chen; Yu Su; Zhaocheng Wang; H. Vincent Poor","11 March 2024","Acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) at an access point (AP) is challenging for wideband millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-massive multiple-input and multiple-output (UMMIMO) systems, due to the high-dimensional channel matrices, hybrid near- and far- field channel feature, beam squint effects, and imperfect hardware constraints, such as low-resolution analogto- digital converters, and in-phase and quadrature imbalance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient downlink channel estimation (CE) and CSI feedback approach based on knowledge and data dual-driven deep learning (DL) networks. Specifically, we first propose a data-driven residual neural network de-quantizer (ResNet-DQ) to pre-process the received pilot signals at user equipment (UEs), where the noise and distortion brought by imperfect hardware can be mitigated. A knowledge-driven generalized multiple measurement vector learned approximate message passing (GMMV-LAMP) network is then developed to jointly estimate the channels by exploiting the approximately same physical angle shared by different subcarriers. In particular, two wideband redundant dictionaries (WRDs) are proposed such that the measurement matrices of the GMMV-LAMP network can accommodate the farfield and near-field beam squint effect, respectively. Finally, we propose an encoder at the UEs and a decoder at the AP by a data-driven CSI residual network (CSI-ResNet) to compress the CSI matrix into a low-dimensional quantized bit vector for feedback, thereby reducing the feedback overhead substantially. Simulation results show that the proposed knowledge and data dual-driven approach outperforms conventional downlink CE and CSI feedback methods, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Drawing on affordance theory, this study explores pathways through new product innovation (NPI) for the effects of marketing analytics on business performance. NPI is a market-based innovation concept comprising customer- and competitor-driven NPD and incremental innovation. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data collected from UK-based entrepreneurial firms operating in the IT and telecoms industries, we apply confirmatory factor analysis and a sequential structural equation model to test the mediating role of NPI in the effect of marketing analytics on market performance and financial performance. Findings: The results show that marketing analytics enhances business performance through competitor-driven but not customer-driven NPD. Although using marketing analytics to generate customer knowledge for existing product innovation may enhance market performance, this positive effect becomes negative when competitor-driven NPD is undertaken to improve existing product innovation. Originality/value: This study makes significant contributions to the innovation and NPD literature. It delves deeper into the existing view on the positive contributions of customer engagement to business value creation, revealing the significance of competitor knowledge to enhance business performance through marketing analytics, particularly in the context of IT and telecoms entrepreneurial firms.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"Dynamic higher-order stereophony","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/490490/","Jacob Hollebon; Filippo Maria Fazi","4 March 2024","Higher-Order Stereophony is a new spatial audio approach which extends classic stereo to higher order soundfield reproduction and generalised loudspeaker arrays, in a similar manner to Higher-Order Ambisonics. Higher-Order Stereophony reproduces the soundfield accurately across a line only, which must be orientated to align with the listener's interaural axis. This work introduces Dynamic Higher-Order Stereophony, which expands the technique to include listener tracking using dynamic amplitude panning. This means the soundfield is reproduced across a dynamically moving line dependent on the listener's orientation, to ensure correct reproduction of a desired set of binaural signals. A number of classic stereo approaches are shown to be special cases of first order Stereophony, and decoders to reproduce Higher-Order Ambisonics content using the new technique presented. A listening test comparing Higher-Order Stereophony and Ambisonics reproduction, low-passed at 4 kHz to reduce spatial aliasing artefacts, shows that the former technique can perform equally well as Ambisonics to the same truncation order with respect to positional properties of a virtual sound source, while using a smaller number of loudspeakers. The approach can also produce rear virtual sources using only loudspeakers positioned in the front of the listener, however with the requirement of listener tracking.","Tech","University of Southampton"

This study aims to investigate temporal trends and geographic differences in maternal, newborn, and child health service utilization between Addis Ababa’s poorest and richest districts and households. A World Bank district-based poverty index was used to classify districts into the top 60% (non-poor) and bottom 40% (poor), and wealth index data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) was used to classify households into the top 60% (non-poor) and bottom 40% (poor). Essential maternal, newborn, and child health service coverage was estimated from routine health facility data for 2019–2021, and five rounds of the EDHS (2000–2019) were used to estimate child mortality. The results showed that service coverage was substantially higher in the top 60% than in the bottom 40% of districts. Coverage of four antenatal care visits, skill birth attendance, and postnatal care all exceeded 90% in the non-poor districts but only ranged from 54 to 67% in the poor districts. Inter-district inequalities were less pronounced for childhood vaccinations, with over 90% coverage levels across all districts. Inter-district inequalities in mortality rates were considerable. The neonatal mortality rate was nearly twice as high in the bottom 40% of households' as in the top 60% of households. Similarly, the under-5 mortality rate was three times higher in the bottom 40% compared to the top 60% of households. The substantial inequalities in MNCH service utilization and child mortality in Addis Ababa highlight the need for greater focus on the city’s women and children living in the poorest households and districts in maternal, newborn, and child health programs.","Tech","University of Southampton"

Although mobile health apps have the potential to deliver behavioural interventions, their impact is commonly limited by a lack of sufficient engagement. The purpose of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to engagement with a family-focused app and its perceived impact on motivation, self-efficacy, and behaviour. Parents with at least one child under 18 and healthcare professionals working with children were recruited; all participants were allocated to use the NoObesity app over a 6-month period. The mixed-methods design was based on the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance frameworks. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and app use data (logins and in-app self-reported data). 35 parents were included in the final analysis; quantitative results were analysed descriptively and thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data. Key barriers to engagement were boredom, forgetting, and usability issues and key barriers to potential impact on behaviours were accessibility, lack of motivation, and family characteristics. Novelty, gamification features, reminders, goal setting, progress monitoring and feedback, and suggestions for healthy foods and activities were key facilitators to engagement with the app and behaviours. A key observation was that intervention strategies could help address many motivation and capability barriers, but there was a gap in strategies addressing opportunity barriers. Without incorporating strategies that successfully mitigate barriers in all three determinants of behaviour, an intervention is unlikely to be successful. We highlight key recommendations for developers to consider when designing the features and implementation of digital health interventions.

While research examining the current state of AV public perceptions and future challenges related to both societal and individual barriers to trust and risk perceptions is emerging, it is highly fragmented across disciplines. To address this research gap, by using the Web of Science database, our study undertakes a bibliometric and performance analysis to identify the conceptual and intellectual structures of trust and risk narratives within the AV research field by investigating engineering, social sciences, marketing, and business and infrastructure domains to offer an interdisciplinary approach. Our analysis provides an overview of the key research area across the search categories of ‘trust’ and ‘risk’. Our results show three main clusters with regard to trust and risk, namely, behavioural aspects of AV interaction; uptake and acceptance; and modelling human–automation interaction. The synthesis of the literature allows a better understanding of the public perception of AV and its historical conception and development. It further offers a robust model of public perception in AV, outlining the key themes found in the literature and, in turn, offers critical directions for future research.","Tech","University of Southampton"
"“You Deserve to Be Satisfied”: Women in Tech and the Affective Reconfiguration of the Workplace through Song in Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist","https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/487153/","Eleonora Sammartino","23 March 2024","Since the late 2000s, public debates over “women in tech” have highlighted the lack of diversity in the sector, coinciding with amoment of growth for the industry (Hardey 2020). Discussions in mainstream media have informed a limited increase in the representation of “women in tech” in popular filmand television. The musical television series Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist (2019–2020) offers an example through Zoey, a software programmer at a San Francisco technology firm who can hear people express their thoughts through popular songs. This chapter will explore the workplace relationship between Zoey and her boss Joan as representative of neoliberal feminist values.I argue that the dialectic between narrative and numbers, characteristic of the musical genre, negotiates tensions over the role of“women in tech” and feminist discourses in popular culture. In the narrative, the antagonism between Zoey and the “brogrammers”makes the inequalities in the industry visible without challenging their structural roots, as typical of popular feminism (Banet-Weiser 2018). The analysis of key musical numbers will then demonstrate how the conventions of the integrated musical emphasise anaffective reconfiguration of the workplace as a performative arena that fosters an emotional connectivity between characters andreinforces discourses of female empowerment.","Tech","University of Southampton"
