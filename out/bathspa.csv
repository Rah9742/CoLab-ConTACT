"Reef fish biomass recovery within community-managed no take zones.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/13820/","Gilchrist, H; Rocliffe, S; Anderson, L.G; Gough, C.L.A","April 2021","Locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) are increasingly recognised as a key strategy for small-scale fisheries management across the Indo-Pacific. When effective, LMMAs can encourage responsible fishing, strengthen compliance and improve adaptive capacity, and may help to safeguard food security, address coastal poverty and increase resource sustainability. However, evidence that LMMAs can achieve long-term biological goals is limited. Here, we used a six-year dataset and a before-after-control-impact sampling design to assess the biological effectiveness of five community-managed no take zones (CMNTZs) situated within the Velondriake LMMA in southwest Madagascar. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that the difference in biomass between control and reserve sites increased over time. Significant differences in biomass between CMNTZs and controls were only evident from year two onwards, with 189% more total biomass in CMNTZs than fished control sites by year six. There was no effect of CMNTZs on the biomass of fish families preferentially targeted by the local fishery, limiting the long-term fisheries benefits of this reserve network unless individual CMNTZs are made larger to accommodate the home ranges of fishery targeted families. There were however, reserve effects preventing the decline of untargeted fish families and species richness.  Importantly, these CMNTZs delivered a conservation benefit that rivals government-run NTZs in the region, against a backdrop of severe biomass depletion, coastal poverty and human dependence on fishing - illustrating their suitability as a solution to marine resource depletion in developing tropical countries.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"The changing exploitation of oysters (Ostrea edulis L. 1758) in late medieval and early modern England: a case study from Dudley Castle, West Midlands.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/11933/","Thomas, R; Law, M ; Browning, E; Hill, A; Small, R","March 2019","Analysis of over 4000 complete left oyster valves from late medieval and post-medieval Dudley Castle reveals the changing role of this perishable luxury over a 700-year period. Throughout the occupation, it seems that oysters were used as ingredients rather than served raw in the shell. A greater reliance on oyster consumption is apparent in the later fourteenth century, perhaps reflecting a more diverse diet amongst the aristocracy in the wake of the Black Death. An increased preference for mussels and whelks is also attested in the Tudor and early modern periods, reflecting changing perceptions of these foods.  Overall, it is likely that natural beds were exploited throughout the time that oysters were being brought to Dudley Castle; however, the evidence demonstrates a shift from limited exploitation of natural inter-tidal sources in the eleventh century towards the dredging of sub-littoral beds in later periods, with some possible translocation of oyster stock. Changes in the shape, size and appearance of the oyster shells suggest the source locales from which the oysters derived changed through time. A notable shift occurred in the fourteenth century, which could reflect changes in supply brought about by altered tenancy at Dudley Castle and/or disruptions to trade brought about by the Black Death. Future biochemical analyses are recommended to provide greater clarity on the origin of those sources.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"The role of conservation volunteers in the detection, monitoring and management of invasive alien lionfish.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/12869/","Anderson, L.G; Chapman, J.K; Escontrela, D; Gough, C.L.A","November 2019","Across  the  Caribbean,  targeted  fishing  is  gaining  momentum  as  a  cost-effective  method  to  control  invasive  alien  lionfish  (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) by suppressing population numbers below site-specific threshold levels i.e. a population density that is predicted to cause declines in native fish biomass. Yet in marine reserve no take zones (NTZs) or reefs at depths of >18 m) where commercial fishing is either not permitted or impractical, alternative methods of lionfish control are required. This study evaluates the potential for conservation volunteers to act as citizen scientists monitoring invasive lionfish populations and to support removal efforts in Bacalar Chico Marine Reserve (BCMR), Belize. Two underwater visual census techniques were trialled with conservation volunteers, each with associated benefits and drawbacks. A log of opportunistic lionfish sightings on SCUBA dives has been used to record sightings per unit effort (SPUE) data 2011–2015. In 2014, more rigorous lionfish focused searches (lionfish-adapted belt transects) were introduced. Opportunistic lionfish sightings contributed to a five yearSPUE dataset that suggests that lionfish population growth rate has slowed in BCMR, where a lionfish removal program was also  carried  out  by  conservation  volunteers  over  the  same  timeframe.  However,  lionfish  focused  searches  showed  that  the  mean density in 2014 was high (mean = 27.05 ± 8.77 fish ha-1, 1–30 m) relative to lionfish populations in their native ranges, particularly at sites at depths > 18m (mean = 43.39 ± 13.76 fish ha-1, 18–30 m). Drawing on lessons from Belize, we discuss the  potential  for  conservation  volunteers  to  support  invasive  alien  species  (IAS)  monitoring  and  control  efforts  in  marine  environments.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Can citizen science contribute to the evidence-base that underpins marine policy?","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/12873/","Hyder, K; Townhill, B; Anderson, L.G; Delany, J; Pinnegar, J.K","November 2019","Marine legislation is becoming ever more complex, so new cost-effective ways of obtaining and processing increasingly large data sets are required to support evidence-based policy making. Citizen science is one solution, but the uptake of the evidence generated by citizens among policy makers is often limited. Here, the importance of citizen science in delivery of the evidence-base that underpins marine policy was assessed using a series of case-studies. There was no consistent rationale for developing policy-relevant citizen science, but drivers included: lack of existing data, difficulty in collecting data by other means, the use of citizen science data by other organisations, and the capabilities of volunteers. Challenges to the uptake of marine citizen science were identified from policy-maker, scientist and citizen perspectives, and these related to data quality, data access, motivation of volunteers, and physical location. Citizen science has good potential to contribute to the evidence-base alongside traditional monitoring, remote sensing, and modelling, but only if outputs from citizen science projects are judged individually on quality. If this is the case, citizen science has an important role in delivery and understanding of future marine policy, but is only one part of an integrated solution.","Marine","Bath Spa University"
"Bryozoans in archaeology.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/9097/","Law, M ","September 2017","Bryozoans (Phylum Bryozoa) are colony-forming invertebrates found in marine and freshwater contexts. Many are calcified, while some others have chitinous buds, and so have archaeological potential, yet they are seldom investigated, perhaps due to considerable difficulties with identification. This article presents an overview of bryozoans, as well as summarising archaeological contexts in which bryozoans might be expected to occur, and highlighting some previous work. It also presents methods and directions to maximise the potential of bryozoans in archaeological investigations.","Marine","Bath Spa University"

"The Influence of 1797 upon the Nereide Mutiny of 1809.","http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/786/","Neale, J; Coats, A; MacDougall, P","February 2013","The naval mutinies of 1797 were unprecedented in scale and impressive in their level of organisation. Under threat of French invasion, crews in the Royal Navy's home fleet, after making clear demands, refused to sail until their demands were met. Subsequent mutinies affected the crews of more than one hundred ships in at least five home anchorages, replicated in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Channel Fleet seamen pursued their grievances of pay and conditions by traditional petitions to their commanding officer, Admiral Richard Howe, but his flawed comprehension and communications were further exacerbated by the Admiralty. The Spithead mutiny became the seamen's last resort. Ironically Howe acknowledged the justice of their position and was instrumental in resolving the Spithead mutiny, but this did not prevent occurrences at the Nore and elsewhere. The most extensive approach since Conrad Gill's seminal and eponymous volume of 1913, The Naval Mutinies of 1797 focuses on new research, re-evaluating the causes, events, interpretations, discipline, relationships between officers and men, political inputs and affiliations and crucially, the rôle of the Irish and quota men. It poses new answers to old questions and suggests a new synthesis - self-determination - the seamen on their own terms","Navy","Bath Spa University"
