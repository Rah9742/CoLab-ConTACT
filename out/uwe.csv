"Impact of disinfectant on the electrical outputs of urine-fed ceramic and membrane-less microbial fuel cell cascades","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11616388/impact-of-disinfectant-on-the-electrical-outputs-of-urine-fed-ceramic-and-membrane-less-microbial-fuel-cell-cascades"," Jiseon You; Xavier Alexis Walter;  Iwona Serruys;  John Greenman;  Yannis Ieropoulos","Feb 29, 2024","The application of microbial fuel cells in sanitation has demonstrated feasibility in supplying electricity and providing safety in underserved communities, especially at toilet blocks. Two different designs of urine fed MFC cascades, ceramic MFCs (c-MFC) and self-stratifying MFCs (s-MFC), have been employed in large-scale feasibility studies. As part of a pre-commercialisation approach, this study verified the resilience of each design when a commercial disinfectant was introduced into the system. Five different conditions, varying in concentrations (24.2 mM–604.5 mM) and the total volume (50–500 mL) of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant introduced, were tested. Upon adding the disinfectant, both types of MFC-cascades exhibited rapid power drops with response times lower than 5 min in all tested conditions, followed by relatively swift recovery times of up to 250 min. The volume of disinfectant introduced had a greater impact on power output than its concentration or dose. Comparing the two designs, the c-MFC demonstrated a much larger voltage drop, up to 0 mV, and shorter recovery time compared to the s-MFC under most test conditions, mainly attributed to the presence (c-MFC) or absence (s-MFC) of a membrane. Overall, both types of MFCs exhibited strong resilience to sodium hypochlorite additions, thereby highlighting the commercial potential of the technology towards safe off-grid sanitation.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"Household water containers: Mitigating risks for improved Modular, Adaptive, and Decentralized (MAD) water systems","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11621977/household-water-containers-mitigating-risks-for-improved-modular-adaptive-and-decentralized-mad-water-systems"," Chad Staddon; Alexandra Brewis","Apr 30, 2024","While the literature on the design and operation of safe water sources in low-income communities is huge, little attention has been paid to the design of systems for the safe transportation and storage of water by households between source and point of use. The design of water containers like the near-ubiquitous “jerry can” in relation to how they are used and the potential risks incurred has received little attention. This is despite, as we explain, the strong influence that water container design has on hazards associated with fetching and storing water. This paper advances the argument that MAD (“modular, adaptive and decentralised”) approaches to rethinking water containers are possible and points to examples that have been trialled in different locations around the world. Placed in a broader theoretical framework, the objects that are used as water containers can even be viewed as “engines of history” through which human communities interact with the (water) environment and can create off-grid infrastructures. Key suggestions for design improvement include recognizing the role of water containers in heterogenous networks and in wider socio-technical systems that can reinforce marginalization, and the critical need for localized, community-collaborative co-production.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"Digital technology in engineering design teaching","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11085914/digital-technology-in-engineering-design-teaching","Rod Valentine; Dr Jason Matthews","2023","Digital technology is widely used in engineering design teaching, enabling students to create parametric  models of their solutions and data files for computer-aided manufacture (CAM). However, the digital  industry is predicted to grow significantly throughout the decade and, in particular, digital twin  applications. This paper compares the digital environment in engineering design teaching at two  universities in terms of how their design teaching uses digital methods. The design projects and units in  which digital technology is taught are identified and compared to give a broader understanding of the  benefits and challenges to the teaching delivery. The different levels of technology in the digital  environment are mapped against the academic years to understand the teaching strategy for large cohorts of students. At both universities, design teaching uses drawing practice to build the fundamentals of CAD modelling and give students the opportunity to manufacture their own designs by using digital technology to  produce CAM data files. Both universities deal with large cohorts and have adopted different strategies  for dealing with the inherit challenges this brings. The delivery of digital simulation is shown to be  similar, but contrasts at the digital twin level, where significant resource is committed.","Tech","University of the West of England"

"Digitalization and employment relations in the retail sector. Examining the role of trade unions in Italy and Spain","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11462615/digitalization-and-employment-relations-in-the-retail-sector-examining-the-role-of-trade-unions-in-italy-and-spain","Arianna Marcolin;  Stefano Gasparri","None","This article investigates trade union responses to in-store digitalization in retail in Italy and Spain. It considers critical issues often associated with the digital transformation of work including excessive work flexibility, high levels of monitoring and skills mismatch. It goes on to discuss two alternative employment relations developments: a ‘low road’, along which digitalization enhances market regulation and employers’ ability to control the workforce unilaterally; or a ‘high road’, where digitalization allows for better working conditions as well as business productivity. Drawing on documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews with trade union leaders, and content analysis of collective agreements signed at the sector, territorial and company level, findings report how Italian and Spanish trade unions attempt to use in-store digitalization to increase their leverage and aim for the high road. Overall, this work confirms the challenges of deterring the retail sector from pursuing the low road while highlighting some institutional factors and trade union strategies that can make the difference.","Tech","University of the West of England"
"The power of a HUG: Implementation of assistive technology across a health board","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11415408/the-power-of-a-hug-implementation-of-assistive-technology-across-a-health-board","Dr Jac Fennell; Matthew Lloyd","None","HUG, a soft comforter specifically designed for individuals with advanced dementia, was developed by the HUG by LAUGH team at Cardiff Metropolitan University. With weighted arms and legs, a soft body, and a simulated beating heart, HUG aims to provide comfort and promote connection. It features a built-in music player that can be programmed to play the favourite music of the person with dementia.  The HUG has been proven to reduce agitation and anxiety, and support comfort and connection for the person living with dementia to the world around them, their carers and their families. Through extensive research and development, HUG has transitioned from a university research prototype to a market-ready product. In 2021, it was launched by the spinout company HUG by LAUGH, with support from the Alzheimer's Society Accelerator Programme. Since its introduction, HUG has gained popularity worldwide, positively impacting the lives of thousands of individuals.  This paper focuses on the implementation of HUG as an assistive technology tool within a Welsh health board, specifically the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board (ABUHB). The ABUHB initiated the largest trial to date with 500 HUGs being used across the region, funded by the Gwent Regional Partnership. As the first health board to introduce HUG across all dementia care settings including community, care homes, and hospitals, ABUHB aimed to evaluate its effectiveness and address the challenges associated with implementing new assistive technologies in care settings.  To ensure a successful rollout, the HUG by LAUGH implementation group was formed to guide the process, raise awareness, and ensure equitable distribution across the Gwent region. In partnership with TEC Cymru, the HUG by LAUGH service evaluation began in July 2022, involving a series of case studies that highlight both the challenges and positive outcomes of implementing HUG at scale across various care settings. This presentation will share the findings of these case studies and provide insights into the future of assistive technology, particularly in care settings where products like HUG can make a significant impact.","Tech","University of the West of England"

It presents an assemblage of paper related moving image artefacts: paper prints, posters, flipbooks, optical printers, scanners, pre-cinematic, early and digital cinema technologies, to explore what we can understand about the moving image when viewed outside of the cinematic apparatus of screen and auditorium. By considering the moving image and its history as an assemblage of overlapping mediums, we broaden our understanding of moving image technology in its material and immaterial aspects. This chapter explores how subjects and technologies interact. The paper begins with Elsaesser’s assertion that there is a need for a new mapping of the moving image in the wake of research on early cinema to better our understanding of audio-visual media technologies. Utilising media archaeology and cultural techniques, this paper explores the connections between print media, film reproduction, and digital scanners. The chapter concludes that archival film practices of duplication are dynamically co-created through networks of technology and subject forming changeable expressions of practice.","Tech","University of the West of England"

"Vadose zone water stable isotope profiles for assessing groundwater recharge: Sensitivity to seasonal soil sampling","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11170349/vadose-zone-water-stable-isotope-profiles-for-assessing-groundwater-recharge-sensitivity-to-seasonal-soil-sampling","Lamine Boumaiza; Romain Chesnaux; Tarek Drias; Randy L. Stotler; Grzegorz Skrzypek; Marina Gillon;  Heike Wanke; Karen H. Johannesson; Christine Stumpp","Nov 30, 2023","Groundwater recharge is widely recognized as being the most important parameter for the sustainable management of water resources. In semiarid environments, groundwater recharge can be quantified using the piston displacement method (PDM). From a single soil sampling campaign, the PDM relies on linking the deeper vadose zone soil pore water stable isotope composition (δ2HH2O and δ18OH2O) to the local meteoric water line (LMWL). However, the isotopic composition of precipitation changes seasonally, influencing the water isotope composition of the vadose zone over time. Thus, it is important to test whether the PDM is sensitive to seasonal soil sampling and whether the assessed recharge rate is independent of the time of sampling. This study investigates the effect of seasonal soil sampling on the distribution of vadose zone stable isotope composition to determine whether the sampling time influences the estimate of recharge rate from PDM. Soil samples were obtained along vertical profiles through the vadose zone in a semiarid region during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. Specifically, the δ2HH2O and δ18OH2O of the soil pore water were determined along vertical profiles, and the PDM was applied to quantify the annual recharge. The δ2HH2O and δ18OH2O values range from −7.3 to −3.5 ‰ and from −54.4 to +7.41 ‰, respectively, and plot along a continuum with a slope less than the LMWL. Samples from deeper in the vadose zone profile had distinct ranges in isotopic composition between the three soil sampling campaigns, with isotopic composition of spring sampling dominated by lower values and those from autumn with higher values. Despite these differences, the resulting annual recharge rates from the different sampling campaigns are comparable (1.5 to 2 % of annual precipitation). Even though the pore water isotopic composition changed over time, the shift between the deeper vadose zone isotopic compositions and the LMWL remained relatively constant, leading to a similar recharge estimate over time. Therefore, the PDM-based recharge assessment in the tested semiarid environment is independent of the sampling time, which indicates that sampling for assessing groundwater recharge can be undertaken during any season.","Tech","University of the West of England"

"Towards social understanding of energy storage systems - A perspective","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11143047/towards-social-understanding-of-energy-storage-systems-a-perspective","Maurizio Sibilla; Esra Kurul","Sep 28, 2023","Renewable, decentralised, and citizen-centred energy paradigms have emerged as feasible and reliable alternatives to the traditional centralised fossil-based infrastructure. In this scenario, energy storage systems (ESSs) are enabling technologies to boost the stability and flexibility of the power grid in the short-to-medium term, allowing local communities to envision energy autonomy in the medium term. Traditionally, ESSs have been installed in individual households for their own benefit. However, new storage paradigms focusing on building clusters and district scale have illustrated the need to revise the role of ESSs and to pay close attention to the social factors, while devising implementation strategies for scaling up these new energy infrastructural models. This study reviews recent research trends (2021–2023), proposing three integrated social pillars for the implementation of ESSs: (i) multi-dimensional geographical and institutional scales of ESSs; (ii) social components of spatial and temporal flexibility of ESSs; and (iii) co-creation approaches to devising ESS implementation strategies. These pillars point out the necessary social factors for the implementation of ESSs at scale, highlighting future research perspectives to operationalise such factors, with a particular focus on the importance of citizens’ perception, participation, and collaboration, which are critical for maximising the benefit of sharing and exchanging renewable energy locally. Development of flexible and agile digital platforms that facilitate the co-creation of adaptable socio-technical solutions to adopting ESSs is proposed. The need to tailor these solutions to suit the stakeholders’ capabilities is emphasized.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Together this is previously termed serious bacterial infection with an incidence of approximately 10-20%. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance advocates a cautious approach with most infants requiring septic screening, parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics and hospital admission. Internationally, variations exist in the approach to febrile infants, with European and North American guidance advocating a tailored approach based on clinical features and biomarker testing. None of the available international clinical decision aids (CDAs) has been validated in the UK and Irish cohorts. The aim of the Febrile Infant Diagnostic Assessment and Outcome (FIDO) Study is to prospectively validate a range of CDAs in a UK and Irish population including CDAs that use procalcitonin testing. Methods and analysis The FIDO Study is a prospective multicentre mixed-methods cohort study conducted in UK and Irish hospitals. All infants aged 90 days and younger presenting with fever or history of fever (≥38°C) are eligible for inclusion. Infants will receive standard emergency clinical care without delay. Clinical data and blood samples will be collected, and consent will be obtained at the earliest appropriate opportunity using research without prior consent methodology. The performance and cost-effectiveness of CDAs will be assessed. An embedded qualitative study will explore clinician and caregiver views on different approaches to care and perceptions of risk.

Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values indicated that eugenol was more effective against Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria. Four different flow-rate ratios (FRR 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1) were explored. All liposomes’ encapsulation efficiency (EE) was determined: 94.34% for DSPC 3:1 and 78.63% for DMPC 5:1. The highest eugenol release of 99.86% was observed at pH 4, DMPC 3:1 (Y-shaped chip). Liposomes were physically stable at 4, 20 and 37 °C for 60 days as determined by their size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential (ZP). The most stable liposomes were observed at FRR 5:1 for DSPC. EE, stability, and eugenol release studies proved that the liposomal formulations produced can be used as delivery vehicles to increase food safety.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Despite different types of memory aid devices available, evidence reveal that it is not widely accepted (Thordardottir et al., 2019). The current study aimed to understand the attitudes of people living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) living in the community and caregivers on the factors influencing memory aid technologies acceptance.  A mixed research method was employed which used online survey data from 119 caregivers of people living with dementia for the quantitative approach, and the qualitative approach involved nine people living with dementia and MCI who were provided with a digital memory prompting calendar to provide their opinions based on a type of memory-aid technological device.  Results: the multiple regression analysis revealed that the technology acceptance model significantly predicted technology acceptance; perceived usefulness: β = .264, t (113) = 3.623, p< .001; perceived ease of use: β = .422, t (113) = 6.059, p < .001; and attitudes: β = .387, t (113) = 5.763, p < .001. Also, caregivers’ sense of competence; β = -.024, t (113) = -2.471, p = .015; age; β = .331, t (114) = 2.431, p=.017; and dementia severity: β =.145, t (114) = 4.521, p < .001 significantly predicted technology acceptance. However, experience with technology, β =.036, t (114) = .330, p=.724; technology possession, β=-.068, t (114) = -.234, p = .815; and education, β=.036, t (114) =.330, p=.724, did not significantly predict technology acceptance. The Chi-Squared analysis revealed that technology access was not significantly associated with household income, Χ² (5, 119) = 4.822, p = 0.438. The thematic analysis findings from the qualitative approach identified three themes; (1) self-preservation of dignity as illustrated by; “I think a lot of people cannot or will not admit that they are losing their marbles”, (2) past the age of learning as illustrated by “I’m sure they are very useful to a younger generation”, and (3) attitudes towards memory aid technologies as illustrated by; “Who would need one of those”. These demonstrated that the relationship with technology was complex and self-protective.  While this study has shown that memory aid technologies possess the potential of playing a significant role in dementia care, there are issues around its acceptance at the cost of diminishing the users’ sense of dignity because of the dementia it signifies. Future memory aid developments are recommended to be inclusive of intended users, clinicians and academic professionals to be involved in order to develop socially acceptable devices that could make the devices more acceptable.","Tech","University of the West of England"

However, during catastrophic earthquakes, the steel core in BRB devices fully yields, which causes the BRB to lose its functionality. While the incorporation of various filler materials, such as new high-performance concretes, has the potential to enhance the performance of buckling-restrained braces (BRBs), there remains a notable gap regarding comprehensive research investigating this aspect. Therefore, this study assessed the effect of implementing ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPFRC) as filler material on BRB behavior. For this purpose, the finite element model for the proposed BRB was developed and hysteresis analysis results under incremental cyclic loads were investigated. Then, the prototype of a BRB with UHPFRC concrete was cast and experimentally tested under cyclic loads by using a dynamic actuator. Based on the testing results, a new design for a BRB device named as rubber buckling-restrained brace (RBRB) was developed, implementing hyperelastic rubber components between the steel core and UHPFRC as an additional load-bearing mechanism to enhance the device vibration dissipation capacity. Subsequently, a finite element model of the newly proposed rubber buckling-restrained brace (RBRB) was developed to assess the device’s performance. The analysis results demonstrate a notable enhancement in load capacity and energy dissipation for the RBRB device compared to conventional BRBs.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Historic urban centres have received special attention in the assessment of damage and physical vulnerability to earthquakes, but it is well known that vulnerability also depends on the social and demographic characteristics of communities. This paper discusses the application of a holistic approach aimed at assessing the seismic vulnerability of historic urban centres by considering their physical and social dimensions. Two index-based methodologies are presented, and the data are analyzed using the CENSUS block as the unit of study, which is scarcely present in the literature. The results of both indices are crossed through a matrix, which allows the classification of the blocks in five levels of priority and are mapped using a Geographic Information System tool. The Historic city centre of La Serena, one of the oldest in Chile, was selected as a case study.

Cifuentes","Jun 15, 2023","Introduction: The rise of soft robotics has driven the development of devices for assistance in activities of daily living (ADL). Likewise, different types of actuation have been developed for safer human interaction. Recently, textile-based pneumatic actuation has been introduced in hand exoskeletons for features such as biocompatibility, flexibility, and durability. These devices have demonstrated their potential use in assisting ADLs, such as the degrees of freedom assisted, the force exerted, or the inclusion of sensors. However, performing ADLs requires the use of different objects, so exoskeletons must provide the ability to grasp and maintain stable contact with a variety of objects to lead to the successful development of ADLs. Although textile-based exoskeletons have demonstrated significant advancements, the ability of these devices to maintain stable contact with a variety of objects commonly used in ADLs has yet to be fully evaluated. Materials and methods: This paper presents the development and experimental validation in healthy users of a fabric-based soft hand exoskeleton through a grasping performance test using The Anthropomorphic Hand Assessment Protocol (AHAP), which assesses eight types of grasping with 24 objects of different shapes, sizes, textures, weights, and rigidities, and two standardized tests used in the rehabilitation processes of post- stroke patients. Results and discussion: A total of 10 healthy users (45.50 ± 14.93 years old) participated in this study. The results indicate that the device can assist in developing ADLs by evaluating the eight types of grasps of the AHAP. A score of 95.76 ± 2.90% out of 100% was obtained for the Maintaining Score, indicating that the ExHand Exoskeleton can maintain stable contact with various daily living objects. In addition, the results of the user satisfaction questionnaire indicated a positive mean score of 4.27 ± 0.34 on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Nisar; Dr. Guru Prabhakar","Aug 1, 2023","Despite there being a proliferation of research into the relationship between educators and work-related stress, there appears to be a lack of research on how institutions respond to this problem. The development of information and communications technology (ICT) has contributed to extra stress (technostress) in the education sector as the need to use technology increases and technostress develops. Therefore, this research aims to explore the concept, role and effects of technostress in educational work environments. The education sector is one of the top three industries where occupational stress is most present in the UK. With potential consequences such as increased turnover and absenteeism, it can create extremely costly implications for institutions. It is important that educational organisations ensure that levels of technostress are minimised as much as possible in order to prevent these outcomes from occurring. An exploratory qualitative research methodology was used involving forty-five interviews with educators. Findings showed different perspectives and approaches to technostress and revealed role ambiguity, technology in the workplace, work-life balance and organisational perspectives and support including understanding turnover intentions as the main focus areas in relation to the current study of technostress in education.","Tech","University of the West of England"

However, the construction industry continues to face numerous challenges, such as time delays and cost overruns, which underscores the need to improve conventional approaches to construction management. As such, training and education are critical components of construction management. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of digital technologies, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and immersive technologies (ImTs), in facilitating construction training and education. Similarly, agent-based modelling (ABM) has the capacity for visualisation and simulation of scenarios, thereby presenting potential applications in this area. Nonetheless, limited studies have attempted to integrate these tools to augment construction training and education. This study seeks to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review to establish a framework that integrates the use of ABM, ImTs, and BIM for construction safety training and education. Based on the review, the framework proposes the utilisation of data derived from BIM to simulate and evaluate construction management plans through ABM. Furthermore, the results obtained from ABM could be utilised in educating construction workers through the use of ImTs. The developed framework provides a basis for future studies to examine how its performance could be enhanced through the integration of different simulation techniques, such as ABM and system dynamics (SD). Ultimately, the integration of ABM, ImTs, and BIM in construction training and education could serve as a valuable tool in improving construction management practices and addressing persistent challenges in the industry.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Globally, the construction sector accounts for more than 100,000 occupational fatalities annually. In many countries, reports of work-related accidents, injuries and illnesses are commonplace, and there is an urgent need to improve the occupational safety and health (OSH) outlook of the construction sector. The fourth industrial revolution presents opportunities to leverage modern technologies (e.g., big data, artificial intelligence, automation, sensors, AR, VR and robotics) to improve the poor OSH performance of the construction industry. However, embracing such technologies could also induce unintended adverse consequences for the safety, health and well-being of construction workers. Therefore, the realisation of the opportunities as well as the mitigation of potentially adverse consequences requires research-informed holistic insights around the union of Industry 4.0 and construction occupational safety and health management.  This cutting-edge volume addresses a significant gap in literature by bringing together experienced academics and researchers to highlight the drivers, opportunities and drawbacks of the merging of Industry 4.0 with construction health, safety and well-being. After a detailed introductory section which highlights key issues and challenges, section one covers the application of a broad range of digital technologies; then section two discusses the application of industrial production and cyber physical systems in the context of construction safety and health management.  Readers from a broad range of AEC backgrounds as well as safety professionals and technologists will come to understand how the technologies are applied and the resulting OSH benefits as well as potential drawbacks.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Reviewing extant literature, this chapter identifies and discusses the barriers to HSW improvement using BDA. The barriers include technical issues such as the inability of existing machine learning techniques such as the fuzzy-neural method to predict HSW risks by analysing incident data, and the large size, heterogeneous and dynamic nature of construction accident data. While the socio-technical barriers include BDA skills shortage, the financial ones cover the high cost associated with BDA. Data dispute among companies, organisational culture, and ignorance of the potential of BDA in improving HSW which results in its limited acceptance and implementation in HSW are identified. There are also operational barriers in terms of digital poverty in construction, and supply chain issues where the fragmented supply chain of the industry and the uniqueness of projects do not facilitate a collaborative environment, a prerequisite for digital solutions. The implications of the findings include the need for an adequate legal framework international standard to settle the dispute between countries arising from data issues. Empirical studies to assess the barriers are recommended.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Cifuentes","Apr 10, 2023","Introduction: In the past years, robotic lower-limb exoskeletons have become a powerful tool to help clinicians improve the rehabilitation process of patients who have suffered from neurological disorders, such as stroke, by applying intensive and repetitive training. However, active subject participation is considered to be an important feature to promote neuroplasticity during gait training. To this end, the present study presents the performance assessment of the AGoRA exoskeleton, a stance-controlled wearable device designed to assist overground walking by unilaterally actuating the knee and hip joints. Methods: The exoskeleton’s control approach relies on an admittance controller, that varies the system impedance according to the gait phase detected through an adaptive method based on a hidden Markov model. This strategy seeks to comply with the assistance-as-needed rationale, i.e., an assistive device should only intervene when the patient is in need by applying Human-Robot interaction (HRI). As a proof of concept of such a control strategy, a pilot study comparing three experimental conditions (i.e., unassisted, transparent mode, and stance control mode) was carried out to evaluate the exoskeleton’s short-term effects on the overground gait pattern of healthy subjects. Gait spatiotemporal parameters and lower-limb kinematics were captured using a 3D-motion analysis system Vicon during the walking trials. Results and Discussion: By having found only significant differences between the actuated conditions and the unassisted condition in terms of gait velocity (ρ = 0.048) and knee flexion (ρ ≤ 0.001), the performance of the AGoRA exoskeleton seems to be comparable to those identified in previous studies found in the literature. This outcome also suggests that future efforts should focus on the improvement of the fastening system in pursuit of kinematic compatibility and enhanced compliance.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Many of the approaches developed during the pandemic are now considered ‘best practice’. Students enrolled in Construction Technology and Services at UWE, are now enjoying a ‘flipped classroom approach’ that involves 1) preparation of learning materials - a week in advance; 2) participation’ on face-to-face ‘lectorials’ and seminars; and 3) practice/application of knowledge through regular quizzes and tasks. Xerte is a web-based platform that enables the lecturers to deliver interactive learning objects in the form of small tasks, formative quizzes, video recordings, embedded regulatory documents and curated resources. The ‘Lectorial’ moves away from the more traditional ‘passive learning’ approach - which this module was once modelled on - towards a more active student-centred, constructivist approach. Digital training and new software innovations are used to address diverse learning styles and abilities, making the experience more inclusive for all. The face-to-face lectorials are regarded as valuable slots in the students’ timetable, reserved primarily for weekly-assigned tasks that reinforce the learning material, as well as offering opportunities for discussion, feedback, peer-review, and demonstrations.

Therefore, BT holds considerable promise for the industrial and service sectors; however, its implementation during the procurement stage in a sustainable construction project (SCP) is a bottleneck because of inherent and unknown barriers. Though some attempts on the identification of these barriers have been carried out, the literature lacks a thorough investigation into the relationships and inner dependencies among the related barriers within the realm of SCP. Thus, a novel combination of fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) and social network analysis (FDSNA) is proposed in this paper to fill this gap; FDSNA uncovers causal relationships among leading barriers that impede the adoption of BT within an SCP, and it determines the most critical barriers by modeling their complex interrelationships in related intricate environments. The obtained results suggest “inadequacies in implementing block chain-based policies” and “unawareness and resistance to BT among customers” as the most significant barriers, and “technology immaturity,” “market uncertainty and competition,” and “technology accessibility” are identified as the most critical. These results present managers and governmental bodies with an inclusive picture regarding the major obstructions to the successful implementation of BT, and it is expected to open avenues to accrue benefits from such leading-edge technologies at a greater pace.","Tech","University of the West of England"

The wearable sensors thus produced show an excellent ability to sense subtle movement or stimuli with good sensitivity and repeatability. Furthermore, by bending the straight conductive silicon rubber tube (CSRT) into three different patterns, its sensitivity was then dramatically increased. Finally, the CSRT was found capable of sensing cardiorespiratory signals, indicating that the sensor would be an important step toward realizing bio-signal sensing for next-generation personalized health care applications.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Our analysis of the bioelectric potentials reveals a strong correlation between higher-order complexity measurements and thermodynamic entropy and suggests that bioelectrical signals can reflect the metabolic activity of plants. Additionally, temporal correlations of bioelectric signals from different trees may be precisely synchronized or may lag behind. These correlations are further explored through the lens of quantum field theory, suggesting that the forest can be viewed as a collective array of in-phase elements whose correlation is naturally tuned depending on the environmental conditions.

To minimise power loss, maintain the voltage within the acceptable range, and improve power quality in power distribution networks, reconfiguration and optimal distributed generation placement are presented. Power flow analysis and advanced optimization techniques that can handle significant combinatorial problems must be used in distribution network reconfiguration investigations.

The guideline, however, analysed outdated studies that provided low-quality evidence. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound in detecting endometrial pathology; and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of outpatient hysteroscopy if it were to be used in preference to transvaginal ultrasound. Methods: A health service evaluation was conducted at a district general foundation trust between 1 January 2019 and 31 March 2019 of all premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed to evaluate the financial implication of outpatient hysteroscopy being used in preference to transvaginal ultrasound. Results: 100 patients were included in the study. For the detection of endometrial pathology, transvaginal ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 65.2%; negative predictive value of 98.5%; sensitivity of 93.75%; specificity of 88.89% and an accuracy of 89.77%. For identifying endometrial polyps, submucosal fibroids and endometrial thickening, transvaginal ultrasound had a positive predictive value of 33.3%, 85.7% and 50%, respectively. It would have cost the Trust 78.7% more if National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s recommendation was carried out, with a 23.4% increase in workload in the hysteroscopy department, and a decrease of 7.8% transvaginal scans performed. Conclusion: Outpatient hysteroscopy is costly and would increase the workload burden in the hysteroscopy department. Transvaginal ultrasound has a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in detecting endometrial pathology therefore it should remain as the initial diagnostic investigation.","Tech","University of the West of England"

"Development of interactive and distributed virtual environments for immersive communication in the furniture, fixture and equipment sector","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/9862290/development-of-interactive-and-distributed-virtual-environments-for-immersive-communication-in-the-furniture-fixture-and-equipment-sector"," Abhinesh Prabhakaran","None","Despite the significance of the furniture fixture and equipment (FFE) sector to the UK’s economy and the construction industry, this sector faces challenges that impede its productivity and performance, including an inability to meet end-user expectations in the delivery of its services. Lack of adoption of digitalisation and poor design communication between the stakeholders have been identified as one of the issues leading to challenges in the FFE Sector. In this context, visual representation offered by virtual reality (VR) can play a critical role in communicating the designs with the stakeholders effectively. However, evidence suggests that the current state of the VR application in the FFE sector lacks three critical advancements namely BIM-data interaction (interaction with the meta-data associated with the FFE elements), human-building interaction (interaction of stakeholders with FFE elements in the virtual environment) and human-human interactions (multi-user interaction). Therefore, the aim of this study was to bridge this gap through the development and testing of novel virtual environments for immersive communication between FFE and its construction project stakeholders. Furthermore, pre-conditions for the successful implementation of the developed VR applications were evaluated in this study through experimentation.  A sequential, exploratory, mixed-method research design was adopted for this study in three phases. In phase one, an extensive literature investigation was carried out to acquire deeper knowledge of existing literature to understand the state-of-the-art developments of immersive technologies in the construction industry with a specific focus on the current challenges and benefits of implementing immersive technology. Phase two of the study involved the development and testing of immersive, distributed and interactive VR applications for various scenarios of the FFE communications for construction. Each application was developed by applying rapid application development methodologies and combining BIM, game engine and low latency cloud server development paradigm. The developments were tested through quasi-experiments and evaluation by stakeholders to ascertain usefulness and utility in the FFE sector context. The first development focused on interactive VR for FFE and was tested among (n = 12) stakeholders using a quasi-experiment in a single-group, pre-test-post-test design. The second development focused on distributed immersion for FFE design communication and was tested among construction stakeholders involved in FFE design decision-making (n = 26). The distributed VR application was further tested further among (n = 9) stakeholders in the context of FFE retail and showcasing of FFE products. The experimental approaches in the second phase adopted combined quantitative and qualitative evaluations to ascertain system usability which fed into further development and finetuning of applications. Finally, in the third phase of the study, the interactive and distributed VR applications were validated among wider group of construction stakeholders (n = 117) using a survey to ascertain industry-wide utility and usefulness as well as establish factors that influence their wider adoption in the sector. A combination of descriptive and inferential statistics was applied to establish findings including Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA to measure variations in views across different segments of the population of respondents.  Findings indicated that the interactive distributed immersive virtual FFE environment can enhance the productivity of the design team through a collaborative virtual workspace offering a synchronised networked design testing and review platform. Furthermore, it can reduce the time required for the stakeholders (Client/end-user, architect, FFE designer/contractor, FFE manufacturer) to comprehend and test the design options. In addition, the developed VR applications can enhance the design communication and quality of the design and encourage a collaborative culture in the industry and improve the design satisfaction of the stakeholders. It was also identified that the VR applications developed for this study can reduce the time required for design decision-making significantly when compared with traditional methods. In the retail and product showcasing context, the system was found to be a highly efficient and viable tool, which can deliver a compelling and richer experience similar to an FFE in-store experience. The testing also revealed that the proposed system not only improves the sense of presence but also brings in a new dimension of a sense of being together, which has a positive impact on decision making. Cumulative findings of this study revealed that distributed and interactive VR has become essential to digitalising the FFE sector’s design communication, with improved design communication being regarded as the most important benefit of its use. Conversely, the most critical challenge that inhibits the implementation of these two VR applications in the FFE sector is the perceived cost. This research proposes a step change in the way furniture design is communicated and coordinated through an immersive virtual experience, thus allowing informed decisions making and creating shared understanding before the commencement of the construction activity.","Tech","University of the West of England"

Set against this background, the public right to fish is often ignored or simply presented as a right to overfish or a hangover from more plentiful times, thus incompatible with sustainable fishing. However, the role of the public right to fish is not well understood, despite its extensive application in coastal waters around several common law countries. Through a case study focusing on coastal fishing within the Devon and Severn Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority district, the experiences and views of people involved in fishing were examined in order to build a picture of the role of the public right in the management of English coastal fisheries. Analysis reveals a right that is valued by society and that is viewed by many participants to be the foundation of management of the public fishery by Devon and Severn IFCA. Participants clearly recognized a wide public interest in the fishery and a need to understand the right as bringing with it attendant responsibilities on behalf of both fishers and the wider public. Embracing the public right to fish and the interest of the wider public in fishing is suggested as a route to more sustainable coastal fisheries. By focusing on this public interest, it is possible to address the challenge identified within the case study of a lack of agreement as to who fisheries management is for and how fisheries should be managed to achieve environmental and socioeconomic sustainability.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The law about the displacement of existing rights by large infrastructure projects is quite tried and tested. Essentially those with property rights are compensated, those who don’t have them aren’t. Although there are some proprietary rights in quota (though exactly what those are is unclear) the UK Government has confirmed that the UK fishery belongs to the Crown on behalf of the public. Fishing businesses (as well as anglers) are exercising their public right to undertake fishing. So where that right is restricted it is a right which belongs to the public. On that basis, if any compensation was due it would be to the Crown rather than any individual. A good analogy is altering the public right to use the highway by imposing pedestrianisation, parking restrictions or bus lanes. Those businesses affected are not compensated.","Marine","University of the West of England"

It is now recognised that Member States may comply with their obligations under EU nature conservation law by taking unilateral non-discriminatory measures within their territorial seas to protect the marine environment from threats posed by fishing. Nevertheless, fundamental uncertainties remain when it comes to the application of these obligations to offshore waters. This article explores the options available to coastal states in this context and the weaknesses of the procedures introduced to the reformed CFP in 2013. It is argued that compliance with nature conservation law in the context of fisheries is not discretionary and that in the absence of measures agreed at the EU level, Member States must comply with their obligations under the Habitats Directive in their capacity as a flag state. Finally, the article addresses the implications of Brexit for the protection of European Marine Sites in UK waters, suggesting that Brexit offers opportunities to strengthen the protection of marine ecosystems by making future access arrangements for foreign fishing vessels conditional upon compliance with nature conservation laws.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Ships are usually under vibration, impact, and other kinds of static and dynamic loads. These loads arise from water flow across the hull or surfaces, the propeller cavitation, and so on. For optimal design purposes and reliable performance, experimental measurements are necessary. These sensors are often used under or near the water, working conditions that improve the risk of sensor damage. This paper aims at investigating, by the use of finite elements, the behavior of damaged piezoelectric sensors under traction and impact loads. The numerical method was calibrated using results available in the literature regarding piezoelectric and elastic plates with a central crack. After calibration, the simulation was used on two types of Lead-Zirconium-Titanium oxide (PZT) sandwich panel structures reinforced by aluminum skins. The results proved that the damage size and impact energy are important factors affecting the response of piezoelectric sensors; therefore, special attention might be considered when using these sensors for marine applications.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Since taking over direct responsibility for the Welsh marine environment, the Welsh Government has failed to integrate fisheries management and marine conservation as effectively as has been achieved by relevant English authorities, particularly Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authorities (IFCAs). A key contributing factor to this failure is that, whilst MCAA created a clear statutory framework for England's IFCAs, Welsh Government resisted the imposition of similar management duties for Wales, and, subsequently, the National Assembly for Wales has not used its legislative powers to create a suitably robust Welsh regime. Furthermore, the suspension in 2016 of the stakeholder ‘Inshore Fisheries Groups’ has partly dismantled the relatively weak co-management regime in Wales. Although the Welsh Marine Fisheries Advisory Group remains, its scope has been much reduced. Post MCAA, the Welsh system has centralised decision making, creating a more remote and less responsive management structure than had existed previously.","Marine","University of the West of England"

We present an empirical study that uses a participatory network mapping approach to provide a broader examination of leadership in integrated conservation and development. We use the Coral Triangle Initiative in Solomon Islands as an example of potential transformation in environmental governance across multiple objectives. Our analysis shows that actants, other than key individuals, enact leadership. We illustrate that a different suite of actants are providing leadership for each of the three Coral Triangle Initiative objectives.

The politics is beyond the scope of this article, but the legal process is of fundamental importance and will set the parameters for any political settlement. Nothing exemplifies this better than the case of R (ex parte Miller and another) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.  The Government had planned on using prerogative powers to trigger article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in order to start the process of negotiating withdrawal from the EU, but the Supreme Court ruled that the prerogative does not extend to acts that result in a change to domestic UK law and that there was no statutory authority to trigger article 50, so enabling legislation will be required.  At the same time, the Court acknowledged that arrangements for consultations between the devolved institutions and the UK institutions were of a political character and therefore the Scottish Parliament will not have a legal right to be consulted on future changes to the legal framework in the UK, let alone a veto on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.

In 2015, policy-makers withdrew three of four proposed Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) in the Irish Sea from consideration for designation, due to concerns that they could significantly impact on the fisheries sector in Northern Ireland because they overlap with prawn fishing grounds in the Irish Sea. Although research has quantified the potential impact upon fishing vessels, none has quantified the impact upon the fisheries sector nor assessed the significance of this impact. Arguably, MCZ designations (or lack thereof) based on the ‘significance’ of an impact require robust underpinning evidence. This paper reports the findings of an Economic Impact Assessment, which has quantified the impact of a decline in landings upon the Northern Ireland fisheries sector and regional economy (data which is currently absent from the evidence base for the MCZ designation process in England). It finds that this will incur job losses in three fishing ports in Northern Ireland, but is unlikely to have a significant impact upon Northern Ireland's fisheries sector and regional economy in terms of jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA). In the worst case, the resulting economic impact is a decrease of £1.05–1.12 m/year GVA in Northern Ireland, which is 1.1% of the contribution of fishing and fish processing to the regional economy. Economic significance assessments, using this methodology, may be useful in supporting the evidence base underpinning MCZ designation and other aspects of marine planning.","Marine","University of the West of England"

In the past (for a variety of reasons) the entire ocean was designated as a fishery using any gear type but increasingly this approach is untenable.  The seas and the fishery (albeit through some strange legal mechanisms) belong to the public who are making a greater range of demands on their public resource than just fishery and navigation; marine conservation, oil exploration, windfarms and commercial dredging are all making a more complex environment for fishers to operate within and are causing increased scrutiny on the basic operational parameters of the fishing industry.  For a variety of legal reasons ranging from marine protected area designations to the rights of the seabed owners it is no longer possible to use any gear type in any area without consideration of the ramifications on other users. Former legal loopholes relating to everything from health and safety to slavery are rapidly being closed in relation to fisheries as the ability to enforce against vessels at sea increases and legal norms are incorporated from elsewhere. Perhaps no fishery exemplifies the tensions generated by the former freedoms of the sea as much as the scallop fishery.  The increasing use of subsea cabling, the establishment of marine protected areas and a larger array of zonal fisheries management measures have all brought scallop dredging into conflict with other marine users as well as increasing focus on gear conflict within the industry particularly those engaged in static fisheries. The introduction of effort controls for over 15 meter vessels via days at sea restrictions in 2015 and other technical measures are the first attempts to directly control the fishery but there is still a long way to go before the public endorsed uses of the sea (and the seabed) are properly protected from perceived wide rights granted to scallop dredgers.   It is time to reverse this approach and identify where scallop dredging should take place and control it that way rather than having dredging as a default fishery.  Such an approach is the norm in other areas of land management.","Marine","University of the West of England"

While shipping is a carbon efficient transport mode, given that roughly 90% of the world trade is carried by ships, the negative impact of shipping on human health and the natural environment is significant. One of the attempts being made by the shipping industry to reduce its environmental impact is to use liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel. This article examines the regulatory legal regime in relation to the use of LNG as marine fuel and highlights the areas where further development is necessary.","Marine","University of the West of England"
"Governance in the marine environment","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/831263/governance-in-the-marine-environment","Dr Tom Appleby","Jul 13, 2015","The governance of the UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies is complex, endlessly fascinating and often politically charged.  There is no area where this complexity is more demonstrable than in the marine environment, where the issues of extended maritime boundaries granted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, fishing and prospecting rights, marine conservation and competing sovereignty mean that the practical application of the law in this area is particularly difficult to interpret. This complex environment makes it challenging to undertake conservation activities. This paper focuses on the Mauritius and UK arbitration over Chagos Islands and through analysis of this case study explores marine governance issues for the UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies in general.  In particular the paper explores the difficulties of restricting fishing activities where because of the long established mare liberum doctrine the world's oceans have traditionally been treated as a fishery.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The research appraised and analysed marine fishing rights, the ownership of the UK marine fishery and the establishment of marine protected areas both under UK and aspects of EU law. The research adopted a doctrinal method triangulated via professional examples adopting aspects of action research.  The scientific research, on which this research drew, established that there is a serious decline in UK fisheries and an urgent need to bring in measures to safeguard the fishery.  The research found significant failings in the common law public right to fish, which designated the UK’s entire marine area as a fishery without apparent reasonable limitations as to use.  It found that the absence of a stated public owner of the fishery with clear public duties makes it difficult to secure the public interest.   It also highlighted the absence of clarity in the creation of derivative rights in the public fishery such as fishing quota, estimated in 1999 to be worth £1 billion. The research demonstrates the significant shortfall in the number of statutory marine protected areas created under the Marine Acts and raises concerns that these statutory measures could lead to paper parks with no active management measures. It shows the effectiveness of the application of the Habitats Directive to protect European marine sites and concludes that other European legislation could similarly be used to protect the marine environment from fisheries.    It also found a lack of a coherent narrative relating to the mechanics and powers and duties of UK fisheries managers and concluded that there should be more comprehensive guidance on UK fisheries law, as the last comprehensive fishery texts date from the nineteenth century.   The research recommends new Fisheries Acts to remedy some of the apparent defects in UK fisheries law.","Marine","University of the West of England"

The proclamation of a marine protected area by David Miliband in the Chagos Archipelago in 2010 triggered a complaint of infringement of sovereignty by Mauritius and a human rights claim by dispossessed Chagossians. It also faced criticism by academia and the UK media. In March 2015, a Tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration investigated the Mauritian claim. In a majority decision, the Tribunal found that Mauritius was legally disabled from pursuing its sovereignty claim but through estoppel the UK Government was required to fulfil its obligations contained in an undertaking given before independence. This included requirements for the return of the Archipelago once it is no longer needed for defence, mineral rights and historic fishing rights. It called for the proclamation to be revoked. The majority of the Tribunal found no link to the exclusion of the Chagossians. It provides useful insight on the development of large marine parks.","Marine","University of the West of England"
"Guidelines for sustainable intertidal bait and seaweed collection in Wales: Legislative review","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/806413/guidelines-for-sustainable-intertidal-bait-and-seaweed-collection-in-wales-legislative-review","Emma Bean; Dr Tom Appleby","Dec 14, 2014","The foreshore is subject to various public rights including the public right to fish in tidal waters. Ancillary to this right is the public right to collect, for personal use, bait on the foreshore and floating seaweed from the tidal waters.  The collection of bait for commercial purposes is not permitted by the public right to fish, nor can it be the subject of a customary right. The collection of fixed seaweed or seaweed deposited on the shore cannot be the subject of a customary right either. To be legal, any such activities must be permitted by an acquired legal right known as a ‘profit à prendre’, which must be established either by an express grant, or by prescription (usage over time), or by permission of the land owner. This means that the legal position of persons carrying out activities on the intertidal area may well vary from site to site, depending on the nature of the relationship between the users and the landowner.  The conservation legislation applicable in Wales comprises two main pieces of legislation; the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Habitats Directive (implemented in the UK by the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010).   The Wildlife and Countryside Act provides the mechanism to designate an area as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and then protects those areas against both occupiers of the land and third parties that may damage the flora, fauna, or features for which the area was designated. Occupiers have a higher degree of responsibility for activities which they permit on their land.  The Habitats and Birds Directives each require areas of land, foreshore and sea to be designated and managed for the conservation of particular habitats and species. In addition, the Habitats Directive places positive obligations on various public bodies to manage the designated areas so as to comply with the Habitats Directive.    Both these pieces of legislation require active management of bait collection on the foreshore. The public right to collect bait (when exercised as part of the public right to fish generally) and the public right to collect seaweed cannot be curtailed other than by the Welsh Government by Act of Parliament. It may be regulated by byelaw, but such byelaws will need to be drafted carefully and be in line with enabling legislation.  Collection activities can be regulated in a number of ways and by a number of different bodies. The most obvious being:  •	the Welsh Ministers under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 and Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967;  •	National Resources Wales under either the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 or the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981; or  •	the relevant County Council under the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1907. Regardless of any byelaws created under any of the above legislation, any collection activities not covered by the public right also need the permission of the occupier of the land in question.   There can be no ‘one size fits all’ approach to bait digging management, as the key is to ensure that any management strategy is backed up by reliable scientific evidence specific to the area in question. The level of bait digging activity that may be acceptable for one area of foreshore cannot be extrapolated to apply to all areas of the coast.   As well as a tailored approach suiting the specific area in question, any management strategy must include (as an integral part of that strategy) a package of enforcement measures which seek to ensure that the strategy is adhered to by all users of the foreshore. A strategy which is not backed up with adequate enforcement measures is likely to fail and may expose the implementing authority to the risk of infraction proceedings under the Habitats Directive.","Marine","University of the West of England"
"Capability-oriented robot architecture for maritime autonomy","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/5263387/capability-oriented-robot-architecture-for-maritime-autonomy"," Carlos Insaurralde; Yvan R. Petillot","May 1, 2015","© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Advanced ocean systems are increasing their capabilities and the degree of autonomy more and more in order to perform more sophisticated maritime missions. Remotely operated vehicles are no longer cost-effective since they are limited by economic support costs, and the presence and skills of the human operator. Alternatively, autonomous surface and underwater vehicles have the potential to operate with greatly reduced overhead costs and level of operator intervention. This paper proposes an Intelligent Control Architecture (ICA) to enable multiple collaborating marine vehicles to autonomously carry out underwater intervention missions. The ICA is generic in nature but aimed at a case study where a marine surface craft and an underwater vehicle are required to work cooperatively. They are capable of cooperating autonomously towards the execution of complex activities since they have different but complementary capabilities. The architectural foundation to achieve the ICA lays on the flexibility of service-oriented computing and agent technology. An ontological database captures the operator skills, platform capabilities and, changes in the environment. The information captured, stored as knowledge, enables reasoning agents to plan missions based on the current situation. The ICA implementation is verified and early validated in simulations by means of a team of two above autonomous marine robots. This paper also presents architectural details and evaluation scenarios of the ICA, results of simulations from different maritime operations, and future research directions.","Marine","University of the West of England"

Despite this, up until 2012, there was no strategic approach across the UK to regulate potentially damaging fishing in sites, regardless of case law, or the implications of damage from certain fishing gears (e.g. bottom trawls and scallop dredgers). The UK Government has recently revised its approach to how it implements Article 6 of the Habitats Directive with respect to fisheries in England which has led to a new scientific risk-based approach to managing potentially damaging fishing activities. delivery of management has involved regulators, NGOs, government offices, statutory nature conservation agencies and fishing interests collaboratively populating a scientifically populated \'risk matrix\'. Regulators are now managing sites pro-actively by bringing into force local by-laws and permitting arrangements that restrict potentially damaging fishing. The work shows the ability for a number of different stakeholders to engage with improving the implementation of a law which is now over 20 years old, but which has generally been poorly implemented in the marine environment. It is an example of progressive protection that makes the marine Natura 2000 network more effective in achieving its conservation goals.","Marine","University of the West of England"

"Maximum sustainable yield? Fish, fishers and people","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/820223/maximum-sustainable-yield-fish-fishers-and-people","Dr Tom Appleby;  Mark Everard; Stephen Simpson","Mar 21, 2014","This paper examines the basis of 4 fundamental laws governing fisheries and human interaction with the sea: coastal states’ rights, obligations for sustainable fishing, duties for health and safety at sea and the public trust obligations in the way the UK manages its resource.  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) grants coastal states sovereign rights to fish to the edge of their ‘exclusive economic zone’ (usually a 200 mile limit).  Those rights are qualified to the coastal state having a duty to maintain or restore fish stocks to maximum sustainable yield (MSY). MSY is not defined in UNCLOS but has been interpreted to relate to a stock by stock assessment rather than a view of the health of the ecosystem as a whole.  Despite UNCLOS many coastal states fish well beyond MSY and even the reformed European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy only commits the EU to reach MSY for its stocks by 2020. Unsurprisingly fish stocks have been decimated, though the bones of reform are in place.  The Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Health and Safety at Work) Regulations 1997 give the basis for health and safety at sea, yet there would appear to still be problems.  A 2008 report by Swansea University concluded an unacceptably high mortality rate among UK fishers.  This has been compounded by recent reports in the UK press of the use of illegal immigrants and even ‘slaves’ on vessels in UK waters.  In the UK the right to fish is held on trust for the public, yet unlike in the management of most public property there is no clear plan to get the most public benefit from the UK fishery.  There is valuable opportunity from implementing the existing regulations to benefit the health of fish, fishers and people, simply by posing the question: ‘what do we want from our oceans?’","Marine","University of the West of England"

Two different designs of urine fed MFC cascades, ceramic MFCs (c-MFC) and self-stratifying MFCs (s-MFC), have been employed in large-scale feasibility studies. As part of a pre-commercialisation approach, this study verified the resilience of each design when a commercial disinfectant was introduced into the system. Five different conditions, varying in concentrations (24.2 mM–604.5 mM) and the total volume (50–500 mL) of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant introduced, were tested. Upon adding the disinfectant, both types of MFC-cascades exhibited rapid power drops with response times lower than 5 min in all tested conditions, followed by relatively swift recovery times of up to 250 min. The volume of disinfectant introduced had a greater impact on power output than its concentration or dose. Comparing the two designs, the c-MFC demonstrated a much larger voltage drop, up to 0 mV, and shorter recovery time compared to the s-MFC under most test conditions, mainly attributed to the presence (c-MFC) or absence (s-MFC) of a membrane. Overall, both types of MFCs exhibited strong resilience to sodium hypochlorite additions, thereby highlighting the commercial potential of the technology towards safe off-grid sanitation.","AI","University of the West of England"

At an individual level the study deepens the understanding of sight loss as a process involving loss, mourning and reconstruction of identity, extending Thurston’s Five Stage Model (2010). At a social level, other key aspects of the research include how perceptions of blindness in Mexico are shaped by cultural constructs such as the Charity Model of Disability introduced in the Spanish colonial period. This model fosters ableism and a social hierarchy that devalues people with impairments, while placing people without impairments as their saviours. These historical influences are mirrored in the contemporary healthcare and educational landscape, marked by resource disparity that perpetuates disability and intersects with class oppression.  Identifying individual psychological adjustment needs of people with sight loss to the care providing organisations was a positive outcome of the work. The researcher developed and implemented a specialist training protocol for psychologists and staff working at the rehabilitation centres, embodying an academic activist approach.  The findings suggest that a positive environment, social support, and inclusion opportunities are crucial for the adjustment to blindness. However, they also shed light on the problems of inaccessibility of education and scarce work opportunities, mainly linked to manual low wage occupations.  Finally, the interlinked nature and interplay of individual, social and cultural levels for people with blindness in Mexico is given a theoretical elaboration by adapting Lacan’s Borromean knot concept, addressing the real (physical loss), the imaginary (personal and social meanings of sight loss) and the symbolic (cultural norms) dimensions, and calls for collective action from clinicians, academics, and activists to dismantle these systemic barriers and foster a greater social inclusivity.","AI","University of the West of England"

Pain is frequently cited as a top concern and unmet need for cancer survivors.  This thesis explored experiences of cancer survivors living with chronic pain after cancer and investigated how their experiences can be improved. A qualitative evidence synthesis highlighted a paucity of studies (n=4), all of which focused solely on women with breast cancer.   Findings demonstrated pain sensations evoked memories of cancer diagnoses, treatment and subsequent threats to mortality and indicated this made pain harder to manage.  These unique and bespoke dimensions to experiences of chronic pain are unreported in the non-malignant pain literature.    Qualitative interviews with cancer survivors (n=19) identified difficult and frustrating interactions with healthcare services: survivors did not feel informed or prepared about ongoing pain, nor heard or believed.  Support was hard to identify and access, and the responsibility of this was left to the survivor.  They experienced being bounced between services, often slipping between the gaps in provision, and reported healthcare professionals had little knowledge about pain after cancer.  However, validation of their pain by healthcare professionals was key to improving experiences.   A survey was developed to gain insight into healthcare professionals’ knowledge, understanding and confidence about chronic pain after cancer.  Respondents (n=135) acknowledged the significant clinical burden but demonstrated mixed levels of understanding of its impact. Approximately a quarter reported they never, or rarely, talked, listened or signposted about chronic pain after cancer.   Findings informed draft clinical recommendations.  These were discussed and refined within expert review panels.  Resultant clinical recommendations are summarised as: PAINS: Prepare and inform, Acknowledge and listen, Increase healthcare professional knowledge, Name and diagnose and Supported self-management interventions.  Limitations include excluding those with treatable but not curable cancer and survivors of childhood cancer plus the challenges and complexity of the language of pain, chronicity, and cancer survivorship.  Further research is needed to co-design, co-produce and evaluate patient information, healthcare professional educational resources and self-management interventions to support people with chronic pain after cancer treatment.","AI","University of the West of England"

Hence, poor payment practices persist. It also found that lack of adequate progress in battling payment problems suggest further research is needed to determine sufficient solutions. Furthermore, it explored if creation of a (statutory) duty of good faith (via legislation) applied to construction contracts could lead to a reduction in adversarialism, thereby causing improved payment practices. This led to recommendations of empirical investigations including whether legislation has an influence on good faith towards reducing poor payment practices by wholly tackling adversarialism through implementing statutory-backed good faith legislation.

Students’ experiences of stigma from staff and peers, and the masking behaviors they deploy to minimize it, can also result in worsening mental health. Despite these concerns, there is a lack of tailored support for autistic students at university. The current project assesses a co-created training course for university staff focused on debunking stereotypes, educating about the autistic experience at university, mental health presentation among autistic individuals, and practical strategies to improve interactions with autistic students. Methods: The Autism Stigma and Knowledge Questionnaire [ASK-Q] was administered before and after the training, to examine changes in trainees’ understanding and acceptance of autism and autistic people. Post-training interviews and surveys were also conducted with trainees, covering the impact the training has had on their perceptions of autism, the strategies they found beneficial, and how they will use the materials in future. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-training scores on the ASK-Q, likely due to ceiling effects as pre-training scores were high. Thematic analysis of interviews identified five themes: value of lived experience; developing nuanced, in-depth knowledge of autism; training as acceptable and feasible; links to professional practice; and systemic barriers. Conclusion: Although ceiling effects meant there were no changes to participant’s knowledge about autism and autistic people statistically, the qualitative data reveals the extensive benefits they gained from taking part in the training programs. Scoring highly on the ASK-Q did not mean that people could not learn important new information and benefit from the course. This more nuanced understanding of autism led to practical changes in their practice. Listening to and learning from autistic people was seen as particularly important, highlighting the value of co-production. Our results also emphasize the need for varied approaches to evaluating training effectiveness, as reliance on quantitative data alone would have missed the subtler, but impactful, changes our participants experienced. This has important implications for professional practice, both within higher education and more broadly.","AI","University of the West of England"

The objective of this scoping review is to identify current and emerging evidence in relation to non-pharmacological CRF interventions for patients with a PBT. Methods and analysis Electronic databases OVID and EBSCO platforms: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL will be searched. In addition, PROSPERO, The Cochrane Library and ISI Web of Science will be searched. Trials registries CENTRAL and the International Clinical Trials Registry platform will also be searched for ongoing research. Inclusion criteria: studies from 2006 onwards, primary research on non-pharmacological interventions in patients with a PBT (>18 years). A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram will be utilised to summarise the screening process and results. Quantitative data will be analysed descriptively, while content analysis will be used for qualitative data. Findings will map the existing and emerging evidence on non-pharmacological interventions for CRF in patients with PBTs.

Those experiencing pain can seek the advice of an osteopath to help manage their pain experience.   Methods: This research sought to explore, analyse, and interpret the lived experience of those who self-identify as living well with pain and the role of the osteopath. Three male and two female participants were interviewed in a semi-structured format. These accounts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to understand how participants live well with pain and the role of osteopathy in their experience.   Results: There were four main experiential statements derived from the IPA analysis: i) Living with pain is exhausting – The participants described an exhausting battle as they learn to live with pain; ii) Osteopathy reconnects me to life – The osteopaths gave them the freedom to live with pain and the participants felt accepted for who they were; iii) Managing pain is like developing a skill – The participants adopted a problem-solving, trial and error approach to manage their pain; iv) Living well has its ups and downs – The participants had experienced living well through a process of acceptance and used previous suffering as a form of gratitude as they felt they had been given a new life, one in pain.  Conclusion: The participants in this study explained living with pain as a process leading to a point of change. They saw osteopathy primarily as a form of support and encouragement enabling them to engage in their own positive health behaviours. Fundamentally, the participants had learnt to live-well despite pain.","AI","University of the West of England"

This approach can collect data from any location where a camera could capture a reliable image, which is otherwise not collectable by the physical environmental monitoring station(s). This approach can also avoid bias due to the location of data collection. The system is evaluated by building a prototype based on the Air Quality Health Index from the Hong Kong Observatory. This is one of the unique data-analytic frameworks based on such air quality measurement. The COLD’s air quality estimation is also based on AQHI, the first machine learning-based estimation framework that generates AQHI as the proposed output. Experimental results suggest that the approach adopted by the COLD prototype is feasible and has some promising outcomes. The results also suggest possible parameters for the CNN model used for the training and analyses of the images.","AI","University of the West of England"

Athene Lane","Dec 10, 2023","This study aimed to understand the role of surgical Trainee Research Collaboratives (TRCs) in conducting randomised controlled trials and identify strategies to enhance trainee engagement in trials. This is a mixed methods study. We used observation of TRC meetings, semi-structured interviews and an online survey to explore trainees' motivations for engagement in trials and TRCs, including barriers and facilitators. Interviews were analysed thematically, alongside observation field notes. Survey responses were analysed using descriptive statistics. Strategies to enhance TRCs were developed at a workshop by 13 trial methodologists, surgical trainees, consultants and research nurses. This study was conducted within a secondary care setting in the UK. The survey was sent to registered UK surgical trainees. TRC members and linked stakeholders across surgical specialties and UK regions were purposefully sampled for interviews. We observed 5 TRC meetings, conducted 32 semi-structured interviews and analysed 73 survey responses. TRCs can mobilise trainees thus gaining wider access to patients. Trainees engaged with TRCs to improve patient care, surgical evidence and to help progress their careers. Trainees valued the TRC infrastructure, research expertise and mentoring. Challenges for trainees included clinical and other priorities, limited time and confidence, and recognition, especially by authorship. Key TRC strategies were consultant support, initial simple rapid studies, transparency of involvement and recognition for trainees (including authorship policies) and working with Clinical Trials Units and research nurses. A 6 min digital story on YouTube disseminated these strategies. Trainee surgeons are mostly motivated to engage with trials and TRCs. Trainee engagement in TRCs can be enhanced through building relationships with key stakeholders, maximising multi-disciplinary working and offering training and career development opportunities.

"Engineering and project management: A long journey towards sustainability","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/10866834/engineering-and-project-management-a-long-journey-towards-sustainability","Dr Rana Al Barazi; Mohammed Kishk","None","The environmental, social, and financial sustainability around projects is currently one of the most serious alarming concerns. However, the progress made in developing contemporary methods for the evaluation and adoption of sustainable project management is still in early stages [1], [2]. This is because the focus is still on the revenue of projects and the performance of organisations via the successful achievement of strategies by means of portfolios and programs [3] This combination of Planet, People, and Profit are extensively stressed in the UN Sustainable Development Goals especially that around 2/3 of the global population are expected to live in urban areas by the year 2050 [4]. This is directly related to the field of engineering, among other professions and practices.  To achieve sustainability, in the current era, engineers need to change the way natural resources are used thus have professional, social, and ethical responsibility. The safety and amount of material and energy inputs and outputs must be controlled by designers rather than treating or cleaning up waste. Design objectives should include targeted durability while making design decisions on recycle, reuse, or positive disposition, embedded entropy and complexity must be viewed as an investment. Designing solutions that are ""one size fits all"" or have unnecessary capacity should be viewed as a design mistake. To encourage disassembly and value retention, material diversity in multi-component items should be kept to a minimum. Energy and material inputs should be replenishable rather than finite. The design of goods, activities, and technologies must consider functionality in a business ""hereafter,"" together with synergy and connection with streams of the materials and energy that seem to be accessible.[7]. However, skilled engineers are not able to deliver such successful sustainable projects unless a blend of technical and non-technical -including interpersonal, and conceptual- skills assist them to explore and act correctly [5]. As such, sustainable project management is the future profession for engineers with significant autonomous responsibilities apart from the portfolio manager or the sponsor [6].  In this context, the aim of this paper is to investigate the role of engineers and the typical issues they face in defining and promoting sustainable project management principles and techniques while enabling the businesses to obtain a competitive edge. This entails a focus transition from controlling time, cost, and quality into controlling social, environmental, and economic effects. We will hereby propose changing the project manager perspective from just focusing on achieving the project requirements to taking ownership of the sustainable growth of organisations and society. The results of this study can be used to feed into theory, practice, and policy.","AI","University of the West of England"

However, amidst this archaeology, this earliest pre-Socratic layer, which provides a philosophical origin story to the distinction between matter and spirit that divides man from nature, has remained largely undisturbed, even though it represents the deepest and perhaps most stable layer of Emerson's intellectual evolution. As I show, the pre-Socratics’ a give shape and structure to an Anthropocenic conception of man’s place in the cosmos that Emerson inherits, exploits, and bequeaths to nineteenth-century American literature and culture through his symbolic literary theory and practice.","AI","University of the West of England"
"Viability of calcinated wastepaper sludge ash geopolymer in the treatment of road pavement subgrade materials","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11515610/viability-of-calcinated-wastepaper-sludge-ash-geopolymer-in-the-treatment-of-road-pavement-subgrade-materials","Jeremiah J Jeremiah; Samuel J Abbey; Colin A Booth; Eyo U Eyo","Jan 31, 2024","Problematic ground conditions constituted by weak or expansive clays are commonly encountered in construction projects and require some form of chemical treatment such as lime and cement to re-engineer their performance. However, in the light of the adverse effects of these traditional additives on the climate, alternative eco-friendlier materials are now sourced. In the current study, the viability of calcinated wastepaper sludge ash geopolymer in enhancing the engineering behaviour of a problematic site condition is evaluated. A highly expansive clay (HEC) constituted with a blend of kaolinite and bentonite clays is treated with calcinated wastepaper sludge ash (CPSA) geopolymer. Activation of the precursor is actualised at room temperature using a combination of NaOH and Na2SiO3 at various activator to soil + binder ratios (AL/P), and molarity (M). The mechanical, microstructural, and mineralogical characteristics of the treated clay were investigated through unconfined compressive strength (UCS), swell, water absorption, SEM, and EDX analysis. The performance of the stabilised samples was then compared with the requirements for road subgrade and subbase materials and that of OPC and lime-GGBS treatment. The results showed that CPSA-geopolymer enhanced the engineering properties of the treated clay better than traditional binders (OPC and Iime-GGBS). UCS improvement of 220 % was observed in the CPSA-stabilised soil over that of OPC-treated ones, while the swell potential and water absorption were drastically reduced by over 95 and 97 % respectively after 28-day soaking. The SEM and EDX results showed improved crystallisation of earth-metal-based cementitious flakes (NASH) with increasing CPSA, molarity, and AL/P ratios, which enhanced the inter-particle bonds with simultaneous reduction in porosity. The modified characteristics of the stabilised materials meet the requirements for pavement subgrades. Further, the equivalent carbon emission (CO2-e) from the stabilised materials were also evaluated and compared with that of traditional binders. The results also showed that CPSA-geopolymer had lower CO2-e at higher subgrade strengths than OPC, making it more eco-friendly. Therefore, wastepaper sludge, a common landfill waste from paper recycling is a viable geopolymer precursor that could be utilised in enhancing the engineering properties of subgrade and sub-base materials for road and foundation construction.","AI","University of the West of England"

Analysis of slope behaviour was carried out with the results obtained for soils having similar saturated coefficients of permeability (ks) of 1 × 10–5 m/s, and rainfall flux (q) of 1 × 10−6 m/s but varying air-entry and coefficient of volumetric compression (mv) values. Results indicate that for the unsaturated portion of the slope (above the groundwater table), negative pore water pressure exists during rainfall infiltration which tends to lessen as the duration of rainfall progresses. An increase in soil compressibility caused a decrease in soil suction in the unsaturated portion irrespective of the rising groundwater level during infiltration. The difference in the pore water distribution was less for mv values below 0.002 kPa−1 especially under major rainfall events. The stability of the slope reduced with an increment in infiltration time as soil compression increased, with the difference being slightly more pronounced under antecedent rainfall of duration greater than 7 days. Although the studied slope appeared to be just safe (factor of safety of 1.2) under the conditions of increased air-entry value, increased compression, and rainfall flux of 1 × 10−6 m/s, the stability of the slope was observed to have been compromised when the rainfall flux was equal to or greater than the saturated coefficient of permeability (1 × 10−5 m/s) of the soil.","AI","University of the West of England"

This is an important process step to improve the surface quality of the mold without affecting the geometry of the cavity. Currently, the European mold manufacturing industry faces two challenges for the polishing phase of manufacture. Firstly, economics when compared to global low-cost production areas. Secondly, the industry is starting to suffer the loss of skilled benchmen specialized in performing such operations. To address these two problems, robotic polishing has been investigated as an alternative or supplement to the conventional manual polishing process in the manufacturing of molds because of its high efficiency, improved reliability, and robustness. This paper presented a new methodology that allows robotic polishing to replace majority of manual polishing work for the manufacture of molds and achieves complete information integration with current CAD/CAM systems. Based on a number of experimental works, the types of features that are suitable for robotic polishing have been identified and a new robotic polishing feature classification has been proposed. A new polishing process planning has been developed to be integrated with current CAD/CAM systems, which includes a robotic polishing process knowledge database; a polishing process selection method; and a polishing process sequencing using genetic algorithm aiming to combine minimum polishing time and the specific constraints and rules for polishing process sequencing. Finally, a case study based on the proposed methods has been given, which demonstrates the proposed methodology is able to be implemented in the practical environment to allow robotic polishing to take majority of manual polishing workloads for mold manufacturing and achieve information integration with current CAD/CAM systems.","AI","University of the West of England"

"Multi-agent learning of asset maintenance plans through localised subnetworks","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11391140/multi-agent-learning-of-asset-maintenance-plans-through-localised-subnetworks","Marco Pérez Hernández; Alena Puchkova; Ajith Kumar Parlikad","Jan 31, 2024","Maintenance planning of networked multi-asset systems is a complex problem due to the inherent individual and collective asset constraints and dynamics as well as the size of the system and interdependencies among assets. Although multi-asset systems have been studied numerous times in the past decades, maintenance planning implications of the system's network characteristics have been barely analysed. Likewise, solutions that consider the network perspective suffer from scalability issues as a network-wide observability is assumed. This paper proposes a network maintenance planning approach based on the decomposition of the multi-asset network into fixed-size localised subnetworks. The overall network maintenance plan is produced by aggregating the subnetwork maintenance plans, which are computed independently via a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. The results are evaluated against a network-wide approach as well as the commonly-used individual approach. The paper also introduces a systematic approach to integrate the MARL resulting policy in a multi-asset agent-based model. Simulation results of several random asset networks and a large nationwide network infrastructure show that, although a network-wide approach outperforms, on average, other approaches considered, the localised subnetworks approach, provides an acceptable alternative in networks with small-world properties, without the need of a network-wide view.","AI","University of the West of England"

To enable costs to be compared within and between organizations, large amounts of data must be classified to a common standard, typically a manual process. This is time-consuming, error-prone, inconsistent, and subjective, as it is based on human judgment. This paper describes a novel approach for automating the process by harnessing natural language processing identifying the relevant keywords in the text descriptions and implementing machine learning classifiers to emulate the expert's knowledge. The task was to identify “extra over” cost items, conversion factors, and to recognize the correct work breakdown structure (WBS) category. The results show that 94% of the “extra over” cases were correctly classified, and 90% of cases that needed conversion, correctly predicting an associated conversion factor with 87% accuracy. Finally, the WBS categories were identified with 72% accuracy. The approach has the potential to provide a step change in the speed and accuracy of structuring and classifying infrastructure cost data for benchmarking.","AI","University of the West of England"

Objective: To assess the available evidence regarding the ethnic profile of adults who access secondary and tertiary chronic pain services in the UK. Methods: A scoping review was conducted (August 2021–October 2021), comprising comprehensive literature searches using Embase, Medline and CINAHL databases and the grey literature. Studies were included if they reported on (i) access to chronic pain services in secondary and/or tertiary care in the UK, (ii) adults and (iii) stated the ethnicity of the involved participants. Studies were included if published between 2004 and 2021, as demographic data during this period would be broadly representative of the UK population, as per the 2021 UK census. A descriptive synthesis of the extracted data was performed. Results: The search yielded 124 records after duplicates were removed. Following title and abstract screening, 44 full texts were screened, ten of which were included in the review. Conclusions: This is the first review to explore access to chronic pain services for adults from minority ethnic groups in the UK. Given the limited number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, the review highlights the need for routine collection of ethnicity data using consistent ethnic categories within UK chronic pain services and increased involvement of minority ethnic groups within chronic pain research.

This study is the first to investigate perceptions of the benefits and barriers of implementing environmental management systems (EMS) in the Maldivian construction industry, and what effective measures and strategies exist to drive environmental management practices. A subjectivist stance and deductive approach have been taken with an online survey adopting a quantitative strategy with a range of construction professions across the Maldivian construction sector. Using a central tendency measure of weighted average, the respondents’ opinions suggest that the primary benefits of having an EMS in the Maldives are perceived as the enhancement of corporate image and environmental protection; while the major barriers are lack of legal enforcement and the requirement for company structures and policies to change to accommodate an EMS. The findings also suggest that those companies who establish a waste management plan and where authorities enforce legal environmental requirements are believed to be the most effective means to encourage more widespread adoption. Based on these findings, it is recommended that managers, need to increasingly promote the principles of environmental management and sustainable practices/behaviours amongst construction industry stakeholders. Furthermore, policy makers within the Maldives should be exploring the viability of establishing financial incentive schemes (particularly for SMEs), in addition to encouraging wider adoption of EMSs across the Maldivian industry sectors.","AI","University of the West of England"

"Longitudinal risk-based security assessment of docker software container images","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11084139/longitudinal-risk-based-security-assessment-of-docker-software-container-images","Alan Mills;  Jonathan White; Dr Phil Legg","Dec 31, 2023","As the use of software containerisation has increased, so too has the need for security research on their usage, with various surveys and studies conducted to assess the overall security posture of software container images. To date, there has been very little work that has taken a longitudinal view of container security to observe whether vulnerabilities are being resolved over time, as well as understanding the real-world implications of reported vulnerabilities, to assess the evolving security posture. In this work, we study the evolution of 380 software container images across 3 analysis periods between July 2022 and January 2023 to analyse maintenance and vulnerabilities factors over time. We sample across the 3 DockerHub categories: Official, Verified and OSS (Sponsored) Open Source Software. We found that the number of vulnerabilities present increased over time despite many containers receiving regular updates by providers. We also found that the choice of container OS can dramatically impact the number of reported vulnerabilities present over time, with Debian-based images typically having many more vulnerabilities that other Linux distributions, and with some containers still reporting vulnerabilities that date back as far as 1999. However, when taking into account additional reported attributes such as the attack vector required and the existence of a public exploit rated higher than negligible, we found that for each analysis period, less than 1% of all vulnerabilities present what we would consider as high risk real-world impact. Through our investigation, we aim to improve the understanding of the threat landscape posed by software containerisation that is further complicated by the discrepancies between different vulnerability reporting tools.","AI","University of the West of England"
"Virtual reality reduces anxiety and pain in acute hospital palliative care: Service evaluation","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11044520/virtual-reality-reduces-anxiety-and-pain-in-acute-hospital-palliative-care-service-evaluation","Nancy Burridge; Alison Sillence; Lynda Teape;  Ben Clark; Emma Bruce;  Julie Armoogum; Mrs Daniella Leloch; Anna Spathis; Simon Etkind","None","Objectives: Virtual reality (VR) might improve symptom management, but there is limited evidence regarding VR in palliative care. We evaluated the feasibility of VR and impact on anxiety and pain for patients in a hospital palliative care consultation service. Methods: Patients referred to a hospital specialist palliative care team, with anxiety or pain, were offered a VR intervention (a short audiovisual experience). Participants rated anxiety and pain on a 0-10 Likert severity scale pre intervention/post intervention and completed an evaluation form. Change in symptom scores was analysed by parametric statistics. Results: 28 participants used VR a total of 42 times with no adverse events. Mean pain score reduced by 29% from 4.10 (SD=2.71) pre intervention to 2.93 (SD=2.45) post intervention (t(27)=5.150, p<0.001). Mean anxiety scores reduced by 40% from 4.43 (SD=2.56) to 2.65 (SD=2.24) (t(27)=5.058, p<0.001). Patients rated the experience on average 4.75/5 and all would recommend use to a friend. VR was described as absorbing and relaxing. Conclusion: VR may improve anxiety and pain and was acceptable in this setting. Large-scale evaluation will generate important data on feasibility and implementation.","AI","University of the West of England"

"Towards a net-zero carbon economy: A sustainability performance assessment of innovative prefabricated construction methods for affordable housing in Southern Africa","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11073809/towards-a-net-zero-carbon-economy-a-sustainability-performance-assessment-of-innovative-prefabricated-construction-methods-for-affordable-housing-in-southern-africa","Alireza Moghayedi; Bankole Awuzie","Dec 31, 2023","Recently, efforts to mainstream sustainability principles into affordable housing projects through the adoption of modern methods of construction, like innovative prefabricated construction methods (IPCMs), have been observed. However, limited studies have evaluated the sustainability performance of IPCMs deployed to affordable housing projects in Southern Africa, where the delivery of sustainable affordable housing remains a regional imperative. This study bridges this gap by assessing the sustainability performance and index scores of six IPCM variants implemented on affordable housing projects. The study adopted a two-phased quasi-experimental research design. In the first phase, the technical specification, lifecycle energy and cost and actual performance of these variants under varying conditions pertaining to sustainability were assessed and compared. The Sustainable, Innovative, Affordable Housing (SIAH) framework was adjusted to enhance its utility for computing sustainability index scores using expert opinions. Afterwards, the experts computed the sustainability index score for each case using the adjusted SIAH framework. Subsequently, the Edge App and SimaPro were used to simulate the sustainability performance of these variants under varying conditions. The study's results indicate higher overall sustainability performance of IPCMs compared to conventional methods. Moreover, the research results proved that the monolithic IPCMs were more suitable for net-zero carbon buildings. The study highlights the SIAH framework's usefulness as an assessment tool for determining the sustainability performance of affordable housing projects and for successfully selecting optimum IPCMs to implement towards eliciting such performance. It is expected that this study's results will contribute towards advancing the SIAH agenda in Southern Africa.","AI","University of the West of England"
"Developing a framework to guide the evaluation of training in research skills for health and care professionals","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11493204/developing-a-framework-to-guide-the-evaluation-of-training-in-research-skills-for-health-and-care-professionals"," Abigail Sabey;  Michele Biddle;  Issy Bray","Aug 31, 2023","Background: Delivering research skills training to health professionals through short, applied sessions outside a formal higher education program, can help fill gaps in training and build research capacity in clinical settings. This has been the endeavor of some of the Applied Research Collaborations funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research in England since 2014. How to evaluate this type of training in terms of the wider impact it may have, has not featured heavily in the literature and methods have largely borrowed from more generic approaches to training evaluation which can over-simplify outcomes and ignore longer-term impacts. Methods: We developed the framework in four stages: mapping potential impacts of our research skills training courses to identify key concepts; shaping into three domains in which impact could be expected, informed by established definitions of research capacity building; testing the initial framework and adapting wording of impacts; refining the framework into a practical tool. Results: The final framework specifies types of impact in three domains of influence - individual, group/organization and health system, and maps these against key questions to guide inquiry, as well as suggested methods for capturing the impact and expected timeframe for each type of impact. Discussion: The framework provides a structure for guiding the evaluation of research training as well as a focus on medium-longer term impacts, encouraging a broader and continuous approach to evaluation. It is hoped this will support educators in other contexts and fields, in the planning of a wider range of training evaluation activities, to capture impact more fully.","AI","University of the West of England"

J. Mayhew;  Hisham Ihshaish;  Ignacio Deza; A. Del Amo","Sep 22, 2023","In this study, state-of-the-art AI models are employed to classify aerospace maintenance records into categories based on the fault descriptions of avionic components. The classification is performed using short natural language text descriptions provided by specialised repair engineers. The primary goal is to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of a complex and lengthy maintenance dataset, with the objective of determining the likelihood of failures in non-critical components of airplanes. Various methodologies are used, including two vectorisation models to natural language representation, as well as several machine learning algorithms such as BiGRU and BiLSTM, to identify repair and replacement event likelihood from the provided corpora. The resulting performance of the deployed models provide a very high F1 score overall, indicating models’ ability to learn repair patterns from the, typically complex, engineering description of components with high confidence. Two case studies are conducted. The first for a binary classification, with several models achieving an average F1 score of around 95 %. In the second case, a multi-class classification is performed for four different classes, with the BiLSTM model achieving the highest performance, accurately predicting the validation set with a 95.2 % F1 score. The misclassified samples were manually inspected, and it was found that in many cases, the relevant information was simply missing from the text due to errors or omissions by description authors. Only 12 % of the misclassified samples were found to be due to errors made by the model, resulting in an effective accuracy rate of ∼ 99.4 %.","AI","University of the West of England"
"Do fast fashion sustainable business strategies influence attitude, awareness and behaviours of female consumers?","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11044409/do-fast-fashion-sustainable-business-strategies-influence-attitude-awareness-and-behaviours-of-female-consumers","Eva Hageman; Professor Vikas Kumar; Dr Linh Duong; Archana Kumari; Eileen McAuliffe","None","In recent years, the fashion and textile industries have come under pressure to manage customer expectations. Previous research has shown that female consumers tend to buy more clothing than male consumers and are understood to care more about fashion. However, existing studies that have focused on understanding consumer attitudes toward sustainable fast fashion consumption have not been particularly explored from the female consumer's perspective. Neither have they attempted to explore the impact of sustainable business strategies on purchasing behaviour. This study attempts to bridge this gap and focuses on exploring the attitude and purchasing behaviour of female consumers driven by sustainable business strategies of fast fashion firms. The research findings are based on responses from 155 female consumers, followed by interviews to triangulate the findings. The results show that female consumers are sustainably conscious and aware of the sustainable initiatives of fast fashion companies. Furthermore, the study indicates that female consumers' attitudes and purchasing behaviour are both (unconsciously) influenced by the sustainable initiatives of fast fashion companies. Therefore, fast fashion companies should investigate how their sustainable initiatives and strategies influence the female consumer in terms of attitude and purchasing behaviour. This study thus adds to the limited empirical studies investigating female consumers' attitudes, awareness and purchasing behaviours.","AI","University of the West of England"
"Toward sustainable composites: Graphene‐modified jute fiber composites with bio‐based epoxy resin","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11045998/toward-sustainable-composites-graphenemodified-jute-fiber-composites-with-biobased-epoxy-resin","Mohammad Hamidul Islam; Shaila Afroj; Nazmul Karim","Sep 30, 2023","Sustainable natural fiber reinforced composites have attracted significant interest due to the growing environmental concerns with conventional synthetic fiber as well as petroleum-based resins. One promising approach to reducing the large carbon footprint of petroleum-based resins is the use of bio-based thermoset resins. However, current fiber-reinforced bio-based epoxy composites exhibit relatively lower mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural strength, and modulus, which limits their wider application. Here the fabrication of high-performance composites using jute fibers is reported, modified with graphene nanoplates (GNP) and graphene oxide (GO), and reinforced with bio-based epoxy resin. It is demonstrated that physical and chemical treatments of jute fibers significantly improve their fiber volume fraction (Vf) and matrix adhesion, leading to enhanced mechanical properties of the resulting Jute/Bio-epoxy (J/BE) composites. Furthermore, the incorporation of GNP and GO further increases the tensile and flexural strength of the J/BE composites. The study reveals the potential of graphene-based jute fiber-reinforced composites with bio-based epoxy resin as a sustainable and high-performance material for a wide range of applications. This work contributes to the development of sustainable composites that have the potential to reduce the negative environmental impact of conventional materials while also offering improved mechanical properties.","AI","University of the West of England"
"SWEL: A domain-specific language for modeling data-intensive workflows","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/11012114/swel-a-domain-specific-language-for-modeling-data-intensive-workflows","Rubén Salado-Cid; Antonio Vallecillo;  Kamran Munir; José Raúl Romero","None","Data-intensive applications aim at discovering valuable knowledge from large amounts of data coming from real-world sources. Typically, workflow languages are used to specify these applications, and their associated engines enable the execution of the specifications. However, as these applications become commonplace, new challenges arise. Existing workflow languages are normally platform-specific, which severely hinders their interoperability with other languages and execution engines. This also limits their reusability outside the platforms for which they were originally defined. Following the Design Science Research methodology, the paper presents SWEL (Scientific Workflow Execution Language). SWEL is a domain-specific modeling language for the specification of data-intensive workflows that follow the model-driven engineering principles, covering the high-level definition of tasks, information sources, platform requirements, and mappings to the target technologies. SWEL is platform-independent, enables collaboration among data scientists across multiple domains and facilitates interoperability. The evaluation results show that SWEL is suitable enough to represent the concepts and mechanisms of commonly used data-intensive workflows. Moreover, SWEL facilitates the development of related technologies such as editors, tools for exchanging knowledge assets between workflow management systems, and tools for collaborative workflow development.","AI","University of the West of England"

However, taking this stance is short sighted as bringing in natural resource management and environmental issues from the start of the peacebuilding process is crucial to not only prevent potential conflict relapse but to sow the seeds of sustainable peace and development. This chapter therefore considers sustainable development and its principles (sustainable use, cooperation, participation, good governance, integration) as policy and legal guiding tools to integrate natural resource management and environmental protection into the environmental peacebuilding process in order to achieve a durable peace.","AI","University of the West of England"
"Suspects still left in limbo? The continuing challenge of pre-charge bail","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/10946383/suspects-still-left-in-limbo-the-continuing-challenge-of-pre-charge-bail","Roxanna Dehaghani;  Tom Smith; Daniel Newman","2023","Pre-charge bail has undergone significant reform in recent years. In 2017, changes introduced by the Policing and Crime Act 2017 placed time limits on pre-charge bail. Notwithstanding this attempt to regulate the use of bail more effectively, police found a helpful workaround in the form of ""release under investigation"", an informal status which proved hugely problematic for both victims and suspects. As a result, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 introduced further changes to the law in this area, designed to address the detrimental effect on the former, yet seemed to show little concern for the latter. This article, drawing on original interview data with criminal defence solicitors in Wales and analysis of the legislative framework, examines the changes to pre-charge bail and the negative impact this has had and may continue to have on suspects. It explores the role of police culture regarding these changes, offers suggestions for how the most recent reforms may be interpreted, and urges that suspects' rights be more robustly protected.","AI","University of the West of England"
