"Influence of blockchain technology in SME internationalization: Evidence from high-tech SMEs in India ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/129062","Rakshit, S; Islam, N; Mondal, S; et al.","March 2022","This study examines the impact of blockchain technology (BCT) on small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) internationalization. Further, it examines how Amazon as a platform reframes the global partnership environment via the BCT network that enables Indian SMEs to operate globally. Data were collected from 291 employees at 43 high-tech SMEs in India. They revealed untapped interest in how Indian SMEs will use Amazon for global operations. Several factors, such as processes to strategize, synergize, and standardize, are described as needing to be addressed before SMEs can boost integrated business efficiency, especially with regards to marketing capacity, scale, scope, and financial performance. The study represents a critical theoretical contribution to Amazon-based global operations by developing the 3S Triangle Model, which could provide a basis for future business practice. Furthermore, the study defines and addresses the evolution of BCT that Amazon has used—and continues to use—as a global operations platform. At the convergence of BCT, Amazon, and global retail activities, we propose and advance an integrated model of BCT-driven global operations among SMEs that provides a holistic view of state-of-the-art practices and exciting avenues for future study.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Venture capital, credit, and FinTech start-up formation: A cross-country study ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/123428","Kolokas, D; Vanacker, T; Veredas, D; et al.","November 2020","Growing FinTech entrepreneurship is a recent global phenomenon. Drawing on the national innovation systems framework, we examine how countries’ venture capital (VC) and credit markets differently affect FinTech entrepreneurship across countries. We argue that with their established and globally diffused norms and practices, VC investors—but not banks—require a critical mass of FinTech entrepreneurship in a country to more positively influence FinTech entrepreneurship. Moreover, we argue that VC and credit markets are substitutes, especially in countries with more FinTech entrepreneurship. Using quantile regressions on data from 53 countries, we find support for our hypotheses.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Agriculture 4.0: Making it work for people, production, and the planet ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/124988","Rose, DC; Wheeler, R; Winter, M; et al.","July 2020","Three tenets of sustainable intensification should guide the fourth agricultural revolution: people, production, and the planet. Thus far, narratives of agriculture 4.0 have been predominately framed in terms of benefits to productivity and the environment with little attention placed on social sustainability. This is despite the fact that agriculture 4.0 has significant social implications, both potentially positive and negative. Our viewpoint highlights the need to incorporate social sustainability (or simply ‘people’) into technological trajectories and we outline a framework of multi-actor co-innovation to guide responsible socio-technical transitions. Through the greater inclusion of people in agricultural innovation systems guided by responsible innovation principles, we can increase the likelihood of this technology revolution achieving social sustainability alongside benefiting production and the environment.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Distributed ledger technologies (blockchain) in capital markets: risk and governance ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/33301","Lee, J","May 2018","Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have the potential to revolutionise securities trading and the capital market through removing reconciliation and other costs that are no longer needed with the trust and transparency that DLT brings. DLTs have been used to create virtual currencies (crypto-currencies), such as Bitcoin and Ether, and to create an alternative financial services system. DLTs are an innovation that can facilitate peer-to-peer trading, bringing about the democratisation of financial services markets. This promise is based on the assumption that the functionality of DLTs will result in two changes: decentralisation and disintermediation. To this end, the author investigates how DLT can be applied to the entire life cycle of securities trading – listing (issuing), trading, clearing, and settlement – currently operated by financial market infrastructure (FMI) providers. This paper attempts to answer the following questions: will DLT bring about the benefits it promises? Will decentralisation increase market risks? Will disintermediation create more obstacles to securities trading? In particular, this paper will assess securities trading on DLT networks against systemic risk, market conduct risk, and operational risk to the capital market and consider the appropriate regulations to enhance market integrity, operational safety and investor protection.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Sorption and fractionation of rare earth element ions onto nanoscale zerovalent iron particles ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/32466","Crane, RA; Sapsford, DJ","March 2018","The removal behaviour of rare earth element (REE), (Sc, Y, La-Lu), ions onto nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) particles has been investigated. Batch sorption isotherms were conducted using REE-bearing acid mine drainage (AMD) and a range of different synthetic REE solutions, which were exposed to nZVI at 0.1–4.0 g/L. Maximum adsorption capacity of Yb and La was 410 and 61 mg/g respectively (1000 mg/L LaCl 3 and YbCl 3 starting concentration, initial pH = 4.5, T = 294 K), the highest currently reported in the literature. Aqueous REE removal to ultratrace concentrations ( < 1 µg/L, > 99.9% removal) was also recorded after 30 min (the first sampling interval) exposure of ≥0.5 g/L nZVI to 10 mg/L aqueous REE solutions (nitrate counterion). Similar rapidity and near-total removal ability was recorded for the exposure of nZVI to the AMD, however, a greater nZVI concentration was required, with the removal of all REEs (with the exception of La, Ce, Nd and Gd) to < 1 µg/L when exposed to nZVI at 4.0 g/L for 30 min. In all systems nZVI was selective for the removal of HREE ions in preference to LREE ions, with the mechanism determined using HRTEM-EDS and XPS analysis as via surface mediated precipitation. Overall the results demonstrate nZVI as exhibiting great promise as an effective and versatile agent for simultaneous REE ion recovery and fractionation.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Patent Information Retrieval: Approaching a Method and Analyzing Nanotechnology Patent Collaborations ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/26716","Ozcan, S; Islam, N","March 2017","Many challenges still remain in the processing of explicit technological knowledge documents such as patents. Given the limitations and drawbacks of the existing approaches, this research sets out to develop an improved method for searching patent databases and extracting patent information to increase the efficiency and reliability of nanotechnology patent information retrieval process and to empirically analyse patent collaboration. A tech-mining method was applied and the subsequent analysis was performed using Thomson data analyser software. The findings show that nations such as Korea and Japan are highly collaborative in sharing technological knowledge across academic and corporate organisations within their national boundaries, and China presents, in some cases, a great illustration of effective patent collaboration and co-inventorship. This study also analyses key patent strengths by country, organisation and technology.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Institutional transition and the financing of high tech SMEs in China: a longitudinal perspective ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/9702","Xiao, Li; North, David","June 2011","This paper examines changes in Chinese high-tech SMEs' access to both bank and informal finance in response to the institutional changes relating to the private sector and financial transactions.Using a theoretical framework based on institutional theory, the paper distinguishes between changes at different institutional levels and between formal and informal institutional arrangements as they relate to the availability of business finance during the period covered by China's economic reforms. The empirical evidence provides a longitudinal perspective by drawing upon the findings from two rounds of face to face interviews with the owners of high-tech SMEs and finance providers in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi covering two sequential time periods: from the early 1990s to 2004 and then from 2004 to 2009. The findings show that the responses of high-tech SMEs and informal investors to the institutional changes have been more positive compared with those of banks. Consequently, access to informal sources of finance has grown, including to longer term equity finance, whereas that to bank finance has not significantly improved. The paper demonstrates that the effects of the overall institutional framework on the optimal selection of formal and informal arrangements to secure funding differ between types of finance provider and are not necessarily positively associated with the phases of the institutional transitions.","Tech","University of Exeter"
"Thalassophilia and marine identity: Drivers of ‘thick’ marine citizenship ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/135096","Buchan, PM; Evans, LS; Barr, S; et al.","January 2024","Changing humanity's relationship with the ocean is identified as one of ten key challenges in the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021–2030). Marine citizenship is one potential policy approach for reducing anthropogenic harms to the ocean and promoting ocean recovery, and there is a need to better understand marine citizenship motivating factors and their interactions. To contribute to a more holistic understanding, we approached this problem using an interdisciplinary, mixed methodology, which prioritised the voices and experiences of active marine citizens. An online survey and semi-structured interviews were conducted to examine factors spanning environmental psychology (values, environmental identity) and human geography (place attachment and dependency). Our data uncovered a unique marine place attachment, or thalassophilia, which is a novel conceptualisation of the human capacity to bond with a type of place beyond human settlements or defined localities. It is the product of strong emotional responses to the sensorial experience of the ocean and shared social or cultural understanding of ocean place identifications. A key driver of deeper marine citizenship is marine place dependency, and it is positively influence by stimulation and non-conformity values, environmental identity, and thalassophilia. We map significant motivating factors to identity process theory and describe a novel marine identity concept. We propose this as an operational mechanism of marine citizenship action, potentially filling the value- and knowledge-action gaps in the context of marine environmental action. This research provides a cornerstone in marine citizenship research by analysing together in one study a multitude of variables, which cross human-ocean relationships and experiences. The identification and characterisation of thalassophilia and marine identity process theory will enable research and practice to move forwards with a clearer framework of the role of the ocean as a place in environmental action.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Dancing with the devil? Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen and the articulation of a new political divide in France ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/135197","Herman, LE; Lorimer, M","January 2024","This paper investigates how political challengers articulate new political divides in European political party systems and with what implications for representative democracy. Focusing on the case of France and the discourse and practices of Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, the paper identifies three strategies these actors have used to articulate a new political division beyond Left and Right: the discursive rejection of traditional Left/Right politics, the combination of elements from across the Left/Right divide and the identification of each other as opposite sides on a new cleavage. Our analysis also suggests that rather than addressing the democratic pathologies associated with the traditional Left/Right party system, this new divide has largely contributed to deepen them. Specifically, the new dichotomy carries risks in terms of representative deficits, electoral demobilisation and the further legitimation of illiberal politics.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Quantifying and understanding dimethylsulfide variability and its influence on the climate system ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/135075","Manville, G","January 2024","The significance of the role dimethylsulfide (DMS) plays in regulating the Earth’s climate has been the subject of extensive study. In recent years, advancements in measurements, analytical techniques, and Earth system modelling have led to the rapid expansion of DMS research studies from which an increasingly nuanced understanding of DMS within the climate has evolved. This thesis contributes to the community research effort on all three fronts and provides new insights from which recommendations for future work are made.  I present new measurements of DMS concentrations from the southeast Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean marginal ice zone during springtime. The relationship between observations of extremely high DMS concentrations in sea ice (>400 nM) and elevated concentrations in seawater (~40 nM) can be explained by a physical dilution and mixing mechanism. Observed DMS concentrations and estimated fluxes are presented, and their importance is discussed in the context of previous regional observations and large-scale climatological estimates.  An objective global analysis of DMS mesoscale and submesoscale spatial variability is presented. DMS is found to vary on the order of tens of kilometres in all ocean basins, and at different times of the year. DMS variability length scales are uncorrelated with DMS concentrations which enables this analysis to help identify mechanisms underpinning DMS variability. Almost 80 % of DMS variability can be explained using the variability of sea surface height anomalies, density, and chlorophyll-a. These results imply that existing large-scale parameterisations are using appropriate parameters but that regional contrasts in DMS variability point to unresolved drivers.  The sensitivity of aerosol–cloud interactions to the distribution and variability of seawater DMS concentration is tested in UKESM1.1. I test the three latest independent climatological DMS estimates, a previous benchmark climatology, a climatology derived from the model’s native DMS scheme, and a control experiment without marine DMS. The latest observationally driven estimates of DMS concentration produce a similar impact in driving the seasonal cycle of Southern Ocean cloud droplet number concentration. The large negative offset in cloud droplet number relative to satellite data indicates that non-DMS emissions and atmospheric processes remain elusive in the model. The regional contrasts in DMS concentration between different estimates lead to a 12 % (0.11 W m¯²) uncertainty in aerosol effective radiative forcing.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Observing temporally varying synoptic‐scale total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon in the Arctic Ocean ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/134779","Green, HL; Findlay, HS; Shutler, JD; et al.","December 2023","The long-term absorption by the oceans of atmospheric carbon dioxide is leading to the slow decline of ocean pH, a process termed ocean acidification (OA). The Arctic is a challenging region to gather enough data to examine the changes in carbonate chemistry over sufficient scales. However, algorithms that calculate carbonate chemistry parameters from more frequently measured parameters, such as temperature and salinity, can be used to fill in data gaps. Here, these published algorithms were evaluated against in situ measurements using different data input types (data from satellites or in situ re-analysis climatologies) across the Arctic Ocean. With the lowest uncertainties in the Atlantic influenced Seas (AiS), where re-analysis inputs achieved total alkalinity estimates with Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) of 21 μmol kg−1 and a bias of 2 μmol kg−1 (n = 162) and dissolved inorganic carbon RMSD of 24 μmol kg−1 and bias of −14 μmol kg−1 (n = 262). AiS results using satellite observation inputs show similar bias but larger RMSD, although due to the shorter time span of available satellite observations, more contemporary in situ data would provide further assessment and improvement. Synoptic-scale observations of surface water carbonate conditions in the Arctic are now possible to monitor OA, but targeted in situ data collection is needed to enable the full exploitation of satellite observation-based approaches.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Practitioner approaches to trade‐off decision‐making in marine conservation development ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/134529","Fortnam, M; Chaigneau, T; Evans, L; et al.","August 2023","Mounting evidence suggests that win-wins are elusive and trade-offs are the norm in marine conservation development practice. The status quo involves trade-offs, and any change brought to ecosystems, economies and societies will alter the distribution of costs and benefits, creating other winners and losers among ecosystem services, sectors and people. While studies are increasingly acknowledging the prevalence of trade-offs, this article analyses how practitioners working for conservation development agencies consider, facilitate and make trade-off decisions a priori and post hoc when designing and implementing marine conservation development programmes in Southeast Asia. We find that these practitioners recognize both substantive trade-offs, which are diverse social and ecological trade-offs resulting from their programmes, and process trade-offs, related to how they design programmes, including between their prioritization of different locations; between strategic relationships; and between the efficacy, equity and sustainability of projects. Existing decision support tools only capture a limited range of substantive (mainly ecological) trade-offs, however, and are not widely used. Typically, social trade-offs are not systematically assessed. Instead, they are implicitly identified by participants and beneficiaries voicing their concerns during consultation processes. Importantly, whether a trade-off is then deemed acceptable is not determined through transparent assessment of trade-offs and principles of equity or justice but by the uneven political power of stakeholders to project their values in decision-making processes. The article concludes that practitioners should facilitate inclusive, transparent and systematic identification and deliberation of the social acceptability of multidimensional trade-offs, and formulate response options to avoid or minimize adverse consequences. Tackling trade-offs in this way has the potential to make invisible trade-offs visible and improve the sustainability and legitimacy of marine conservation development programmes while promoting the interests of the most marginalized in efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals.

"Antarctic extreme events ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/134604","Siegert, MJ; Bentley, MJ; Atkinson, A; et al.","August 2023","There is increasing evidence that fossil-fuel burning, and consequential global heating of 1.1°C to date, has led to the increased occurrence and severity of extreme environmental events. It is well documented how such events have impacted society outside Antarctica through enhanced levels of rainfall and flooding, heatwaves and wildfires, drought and water/food shortages and episodes of intense cooling. Here, we briefly examine evidence for extreme events in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean across a variety of environments and timescales. We show how vulnerable natural Antarctic systems are to extreme events and highlight how governance and environmental protection of the continent must take them into account. Given future additional heating of at least 0.4°C is now unavoidable (to contain heating to the “Paris Agreement 1.5°C” scenario), and may indeed be higher unless drastic action is successfully taken on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by mid-Century, we explain it is virtually certain that future Antarctic extreme events will be more pronounced than those observed to date.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Using citizen science to understand floating plastic debris distribution and abundance: A case study from the North Cornish coast (United Kingdom) ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133667","Clark, L; Allen, R; Botterell, ZLR; et al.","July 2023","Citizen science is now commonly employed to collect data on plastic pollution and is recognised as a valuable tool for furthering our understanding of the issue. Few studies, however, use citizen science to gather information on water-borne plastic debris. Here, citizen scientists adopted a globally standardised methodology to sample the sea-surface for small (1-5 mm) floating plastic debris off the Cornish coast (UK). Twenty-eight trawls were conducted along five routes, intersecting two Marine Protected Areas. Of the 509 putative plastic items, fragments were most common (64%), then line (19%), foam (7%), film (6%), and pellets (4%). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy identified the most common polymer type as polyethylene (31%), then nylon (12%), polypropylene (8 %), polyamide (5%) and polystyrene (3%). This study provides the first globally comparative baseline of floating plastic debris for the region (mean: 8512 items km−2), whilst contributing to an international dataset aimed at understanding plastic abundance and distribution worldwide.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Environmental Damage Caused by Marine Litter: A Legal Discussion on Responsibility and its Allocation Among States ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133311","Dan, HJ","June 2023","About two-thirds of the Earth is composed of oceans and is home to hundreds of millions of species of organisms. The oceans also absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and play an essential role in mitigating climate change. In addition, the sea provides abundant resources, serves as the most critical transportation route for world trade and has significant value in terms of human economy and industry. As such, the ocean is closely related to our lives, and its importance is indescribable. However, the ocean, which is inextricably related to our lives, is greatly threatened by pollution, and one of the problems is pollution from marine litter.  Various marine organisms are physically affected by being entangled in or ingesting marine litter floating in the sea, and the invasion of alien species threatens the ecosystem through floating debris. Marine litter also affects marine industries such as shipping and tourism and has a serious impact on the human economy, society, and health through the sustainability and food chain of the marine environment. However, marine litter that negatively affects the marine environment and human life is becoming more serious.  Marine litter has a transboundary nature that moves to an area beyond its jurisdiction by currents, winds, and various natural phenomena. It also has the property of being oxidised and decomposed in the atmosphere and fragmented into fine pieces. It also moves through imports and exports of waste between countries. Waste transported to developing countries is often discharged into the ocean due to insufficient management capability. Therefore, marine litter is a pollutant that may differ between the person who initially generated it and the person who finally discharged it into the sea. In addition, marine litter is a pollutant composed of several polluters and victims, and in fact, it is an environmental issue in which we can all become polluters and victims. Moreover, the damage caused by marine litter often doesn't become immediately apparent. It may only become evident after a certain amount of time has passed and pollutants have accumulated. Therefore, identifying the causal relationship and measuring the damage caused by pollutants can be quite challenging.  Even though marine litter that has such a negative impact on the marine environment and human life is a pollutant that must be regulated, there is currently no legally binding treaty at the international level that directly regulates marine litter. In addition, there are many difficulties in determining responsibility for environmental damage caused by marine litter under the current responsibility regime in international environmental law.  Therefore, this thesis aims to present the responsibility and allocation of environmental damage caused by marine litter. To this end, this thesis suggests that it is necessary to adopt and apply international environmental principles to overcome the limitations of marine litter reduction, responsibility, and allocation. Moreover, this thesis will not only present a simple argument that marine litter should be reduced for environmental protection and the international community's attention is needed, but it will also constitute a piece of original research that suggests specific measures for the responsibility and allocation of marine litter.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"A framework for studying ecological energy in the contemporary marine environment ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/134490","Kressler, MM; Dall, SRX; Sherley, RB","June 2023","Historic limitations have resulted in marine ecological studies usually overlooking some well-established concepts from behavioural ecology. This is likely because the methods available were easily overwhelmed by the scale of ecological processes and sampling resolution in the marine environment. Innovations in technology, data management, and statistical modelling now provide the capacity to fully embrace behavioural ecology concepts and study marine ecological interactions from a more holistic perspective. To facilitate this vision, we propose a novel perspective and workflow for marine ecology: the Seascape of Ecological Energy, or SEE-scapes. SEE-scapes contextualizes the accumulated knowledge from marine biology and behavioural ecology research and provides a guide for marine scientists interested in grounding their research in behavioural ecology's first principles. SEE-scapes specifies relevant considerations for contemporary seascapes, with special attention to relationships between individuals and their conspecifics, competitors, predators, and the abiotic environment. It is formulated to account for how the unique features of marine vertebrates require revisions to standard, terrestrially focused methodological approaches, and offers solutions for how to sample and model the eco-evolutionary drivers of behaviour across the dynamic and hierarchical seascape. Simply put, SEE-scapes provides the guidance to translate a dynamic system and reveal opportunities for collaborative and integrative research.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Avian Ecology in a Changing World ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133305","Morten, J","June 2023","Migratory birds rely on different sites throughout their annual cycle to breed, overwinter and to stop and refuel during migration. Dependence on multiple sites means that migratory bird populations are more likely to decline than non-migratory species, and their conservation is often more complicated and requires a holistic approach with international collaborations. In a rapidly changing world there are a suite of potential threats, many caused by human activities, which can threaten the conservation of migratory birds. In this thesis, I examine how changes to prey landscapes and shifts in weather and climate could impact the behaviours of Eurasian oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus and arctic terns Sterna paradisaea. In the four data chapters I use a combination of GPS tracking technology and field observations to investigate the species foraging behaviours, determine how they respond to weather conditions, model oystercatcher survival, and project how future climate change might alter arctic tern migration. This thesis reveals that (i) oystercatchers in the Exe Estuary may be travelling outside of the protected area to forage, with younger individuals travelling further; (ii) the survival rates of juveniles, sub-adults and adult oystercatchers in Exe Estuary were high over the last four years, indicating that the long-term population decline may be caused by factors away from the Exe; (iii) incubating arctic terns forage over seven times further from the colony than previously recorded, they do not alter their behaviour in response to the winds, and they do not forage in the same areas at the same time as fishing operations; and (iv) projected changes to environmental conditions by 2100, including a reduction in Southern Ocean sea ice, reduced primary productivity at a key stopover site and changes to wind support could affect arctic terns during the migration and non-breeding periods. Collectively this work highlights how species may respond to environmental change, and the importance of examining extrinsic factors in combination with biologging and field observations to understand animal behaviour.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Marine big data-driven ensemble learning for estimating global phytoplankton group composition over two decades (1997–2020) ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133153","Zhang, Y; Shen, F; Sun, X; et al.","May 2023","Accurate monitoring of the spatial-temporal distribution and variability of phytoplankton group (PG) composition is of vital importance in better understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. While existing bio-optical algorithms provide valuable information, relying solely on satellite ocean color data remains insufficient to obtain high-precision retrieval of PG due to the intricate nature of the bio-optical signal and PG composition itself. An interdisciplinary approach combining advancements in machine learning with big data from ocean observations and simulations offers a promising avenue for more accurate quantification of PG composition. In this study, an ensemble learning approach, called the spatial-temporal-ecological ensemble (STEE) model, is developed to construct a robust prediction model for eight distinct phytoplankton groups (i.e., Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, Haptophytes, Pelagophytes, Cryptophytes, Green Algae, Prokaryotes, and Prochlorococcus). The proposed method introduces multiple data simultaneously: ocean color, physical oceanographic, biogeochemical, and spatial and temporal information. An ensemble strategy is applied to increase the performance of the model by merging three advanced machine-learning algorithms. The combined validation of multiple cross-validation (CV) strategies (i.e., standard, spatial block, and temporal block CVs) shows that the proposed STEE model has superior robustness and generalization ability. In addition, the analysis shows a high degree of concordance between the independent datasets and the modeled estimations for long-time series sites, indicating that the STEE model is capable of effectively monitoring long-term trends in phytoplankton group composition. Finally, the proposed model was utilized to retrieve global monthly phytoplankton group products (STEE-PG) over an extended period (September 1997 to May 2020), and comparisons demonstrated better rationality of spatio-temporal distribution than existing satellite-derived phytoplankton group products. Hence, this new model comprehensively integrates all kinds of observation data and yields long-term global PG products with high accuracy, which will enhance our understanding of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental and climate change.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Marine turtles: a comprehensive review and an assessment of climate change-associated impacts in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133018","Alameri, H","April 2023","Climate change threatens marine turtles that depend on beaches for nesting with temperature changes affecting embryonic development and sex determination. Sea level rise may destroy their nesting habitats, and warming temperatures may cause complete development failure and imbalanced sex ratios. It is critical, therefore, to understand the likely climate change impacts to ensure mitigation is undertaken. It is particularly useful to examine climate change impacts in areas already facing extreme environmental conditions. The northwestern Indian Ocean (NWIO) is a relatively understudied region regarding marine turtles. Key knowledge gaps helped shape the main aims of this thesis, and these are: 1. to understand the status of marine turtles in the NWIO region from published material and regional expert elicitation; 2. to analyze 20 years of available data on marine turtles in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; 3. to investigate nest temperatures in Abu Dhabi to estimate primary sex ratios and the likely impact of global climate change on population dynamics and conservation, and; 4. to estimate the level of nest inundation that might result from forecast sea level rises associated with climate change. My key findings were that: 1. Significant research and conservation efforts have focused on marine turtles across the NWIO region. I identified major threats, knowledge gaps, impediments to practical conservation, and strengths and opportunities towards creating a knowledge base for future research. 6 2. The long-term marine turtle conservation plan in Abu Dhabi Emirate covers nesting ecology, foraging, mortality investigations, and rehabilitation initiatives. The mean estimate of hawksbill turtle clutches per year was 220 while the foraging population of all species and all sizes found in the emirate is 5,550–7,488 individuals. The majority of mortality was due to drowning in abandoned nets. Further research, including additional in-water foraging studies, population structure, and comprehensive nesting trends, is vital. 3. Primary sex ratios of hawksbill hatchlings are prone to be highly female-biased (> 80 % female), and only nests in the first three weeks of the breeding season were likely to have produced male hatchlings. 4. Beaches at major nesting islands will be profoundly affected by inundation due to sea level rise, however, the core nesting areas will remain as potential nesting sites. I propose additional management approaches under each aspect and a detailed list of research priorities for Abu Dhabi","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Marine plastic: The solution is bigger than removal ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132886","García-Hermosa, MI; Woodall, LC","April 2023","Despite the increase in the documentation on, and interest in marine debris, there remains a gap between the analytic information available and the recommendations developed by policy and decision makers that could reduce this pollutant. Our paper summarizes some successful initiatives across policy, industry, infrastructure and education; and where they sit in the value chain of plastic products. We suggest that a multidisciplinary approach is required to most effectively address the marine plastic litter problem. This approach should emphasize (1) minimizing plastic production and consumption (where possible), and waste leakage; by (2) improving waste management (taking into consideration the informal sector) rather than focussing on clean-up activities. We then suggest some steps that once addressed would assist policy professionals, and a wide variety of entities and individuals with decision-making to reduce marine plastic litter. We suggest the creation of a user-friendly framework (tool) would facilitate transparency and democratization of the decision-making process across stakeholders and the wider community. This tool would be most useful if it comprised information on (i) defining appropriate metrics for quantifying plastic waste for the study/work case; (ii) providing a list of possible interventions with their key associated enabling and disabling factors, (iii) identifying the main influential factors specific to the situation/region; (iv) recognizing the risks associated with the selected interventions and the consequences of these interventions on the most influential factors; (v) objectively ranking solutions using the information gathered (metrics, targets, risks, factors) based on the regional, national, and/or international context. This tool then provides an opportunity for user groups to explore different suites of options for tackling marine plastic pollution and co-create a suite that is optimum for them.","Marine","University of Exeter"

"Coral adaptive capacity insufficient to halt global transition of coral reefs into net erosion under climate change ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132738","Cornwall, CE; Comeau, S; Donner, SD; et al.","March 2023","Projecting the effects of climate change on net reef calcium carbonate production is critical to understanding the future impacts on ecosystem function, but prior estimates have not included corals' natural adaptive capacity to such change. Here we estimate how the ability of symbionts to evolve tolerance to heat stress, or for coral hosts to shuffle to favourable symbionts, and their combination, may influence responses to the combined impacts of ocean warming and acidification under three representative concentration pathway (RCP) emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We show that symbiont evolution and shuffling, both individually and when combined, favours persistent positive net reef calcium carbonate production. However, our projections of future net calcium carbonate production (NCCP) under climate change vary both spatially and by RCP. For example, 19%–35% of modelled coral reefs are still projected to have net positive NCCP by 2050 if symbionts can evolve increased thermal tolerance, depending on the RCP. Without symbiont adaptive capacity, the number of coral reefs with positive NCCP drops to 9%–13% by 2050. Accounting for both symbiont evolution and shuffling, we project median positive NCPP of coral reefs will still occur under low greenhouse emissions (RCP2.6) in the Indian Ocean, and even under moderate emissions (RCP4.5) in the Pacific Ocean. However, adaptive capacity will be insufficient to halt the transition of coral reefs globally into erosion by 2050 under severe emissions scenarios (RCP8.5).","Marine","University of Exeter"

The field is underpinned by knowledge-deficit and technocratic approaches to behaviour change such as awareness raising, ocean literacy, and environmental attitudes research. In this paper we develop an interdisciplinary and inclusive conceptualisation of marine citizenship. We use mixed methods to study the views and experiences of active marine citizens in the United Kingdom to broaden understandings of marine citizens’ characterisation of marine citizenship, and their perceptions of its importance in policy- and decision-making. Our study shows that marine citizenship entails more than individual pro-environmental behaviours, and includes public-facing and socially collective political actions. We contextualise the role of knowledge, finding more complexity than normative knowledge-deficit approaches permit. We illustrate the importance of a rights-based framing of marine citizenship which incorporates political and civic rights to participate in the transformation of the human-ocean relationship for sustainability. Recognising this more inclusive approach to marine citizenship, we propose an expanded definition to support further exploration of the multiple dimensions and complexities of marine citizenship and to enhance its benefits for marine policy and management.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Offshore Logistics: Scenario Planning and Installation Modeling of Floating Offshore Wind Projects ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132627","Torres, ES; Thies, PR; Lawless, M","March 2023","The offshore installation, logistics, and commissioning activities are currently estimated to make up 20% to 30% of the capital expenditures (CAPEX) of offshore wind projects. Technical and geographical factors affect both the CAPEX during construction and the installation schedule, such as a lack of supporting port infrastructure, the availability of specialized vessels, the distance from the wind farm to shore, accessibility, water depths, and seabed conditions. In addition, there are significant risks during the construction phase, such as uncertain durations due to the sensitivity of marine operations to weather conditions. Identifying supply chain requirements is critical in the early stages of project planning in order to avoid time delays and cost overruns during the transport and installation process. This study explores and analyzes the logistic requirements and installation methods of a floating offshore wind (FOW) technology. Using an advanced forecasting and decision support tool, realistic case scenarios are simulated at a variety of potential sites for FOW deployment across the UK. Technical risks associated with installation strategies are identified and classified. The results provide a comparison of key installation performance indicators of each case scenario (e.g., installation rate per wind turbine, weather downtime). This study is of interest to researchers, offshore wind project developers, service providers, and other key stakeholders seeking to optimize planning and logistics to drive down CAPEX costs, reduce the construction downtime, and minimize risks during marine operations.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Interactions between marine megafauna and plastic pollution in Southeast Asia ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132601","Omeyer, LCM; Duncan, EM; Abreo, NAS; et al.","March 2023","Southeast (SE) Asia is a highly biodiverse region, yet it is also estimated to cumulatively contribute a third of the total global marine plastic pollution. This threat is known to have adverse impacts on marine megafauna, however, understanding of its impacts has recently been highlighted as a priority for research in the region. To address this knowledge gap, a structured literature review was conducted for species of cartilaginous fishes, marine mammals, marine reptiles, and seabirds present in SE Asia, collating cases on a global scale to allow for comparison, coupled with a regional expert elicitation to gather additional published and grey literature cases which would have been omitted during the structured literature review. Of the 380 marine megafauna species present in SE Asia, but also studied elsewhere, we found that 9.1 % and 4.5 % of all publications documenting plastic entanglement (n = 55) and ingestion (n = 291) were conducted in SE Asian countries. At the species level, published cases of entanglement from SE Asian countries were available for 10 % or less of species within each taxonomic group. Additionally, published ingestion cases were available primarily for marine mammals and were lacking entirely for seabirds in the region. The regional expert elicitation led to entanglement and ingestion cases from SE Asian countries being documented in 10 and 15 additional species respectively, highlighting the utility of a broader approach to data synthesis. While the scale of the plastic pollution in SE Asia is of particular concern for marine ecosystems, knowledge of its interactions and impacts on marine megafauna lags behind other areas of the world, even after the inclusion of a regional expert elicitation. Additional funding to help collate baseline data are critically needed to inform policy and solutions towards limiting the interactions of marine megafauna and plastic pollution in SE Asia.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Disturbance on any scale is likely to be long lasting and irreversible. Scant research to date has examined the impact that deep sea minerals extraction would have on cetaceans. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) is of particular interest to mining companies aiming to exploit polymetallic nodules. The CCZ, with an average depth of 5,500 m and an area of approximately 11,650,000 km2, is a habitat for cetaceans including baleen (mysticetes) and toothed whales (odontocetes). Of particular concern is anthropogenic noise. If permitted, commercial-scale mining is expected to operate 24-hours a day, at varying depths. The sounds produced from mining operations, including from remotely operated vehicles on the seafloor, overlap with the frequencies at which cetaceans communicate, which can cause auditory masking and behavior change in marine mammals. Cetaceans are already facing numerous stressors, including climate change, and many species are still recovering from centuries of exploitation. We argue the need for urgent research to assess more fully the potential impact of deep seabed mining on cetaceans.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Putting coastal communities at the center of a sustainable blue economy: A review of risks, opportunities, and strategies ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132521","Evans, LS; Buchan, PM; Fortnam, M; et al.","February 2023","New approaches to ocean governance for coastal communities are needed. With few exceptions, the status quo does not meet the diverse development aspirations of coastal communities or ensure healthy oceans for current and future generations. The blue economy is expected to grow to USD2.5–3 trillion by 2030, and there is particular interest in its potential to alleviate poverty in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, and to support a blue recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a selective, thematic review of the blue economy literature to examine: (i) the opportunities and risks for coastal communities, (ii) the barriers and enablers that shape community engagement, and (iii) the strategies employed by communities and supporting organizations, which can be strengthened to deliver a ‘sustainable' blue economy and improve social justice for coastal communities. Our review finds that under business-as-usual and blue growth, industrial fisheries, large-scale aquaculture, land reclamation, mining, and oil and gas raise red flags for communities and marine ecosystems. Whereas, if managed sustainably, small-scale fisheries, coastal aquaculture, seaweed farming and eco-tourism are the most likely to deliver benefits to communities. Yet, these are also the sectors most vulnerable to negative and cumulative impacts from other sectors. Based on our evaluation of enablers, barriers and strategies, the paper argues that putting coastal communities at the center of a clear vision for an inclusive Sustainable Blue Economy and co-developing a shared and accessible language for communities, practitioners and policy-makers is essential for a more equitable ocean economy, alongside mainstreaming social justice principles and integrated governance that can bridge different scales of action and opportunity.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Power and Polycentric Coastal Governance: Livelihoods, Equity, and Environmental Change in the Philippines ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132389","Jack-Kadioglu, T","January 2023","Ocean and coastal spaces are sites of increasing complexity and environmental change, driven by declining resources and a rise in actors seeking to exploit marine environments. In response, recent years have seen a resurgence in scientific interest in polycentric governance as both an analytic tool and solution to coastal resource use and management. Research however has begun to critique polycentric governance’s limited engagement with power, and how this influences the processes and outcomes of governance. Drawing from institutional theory and political ecology, this research explores the role of power in polycentric governance. Specifically, it examines how actors use different types of power to interpret, support, and contest environmental governance processes, and how this impacts the equity, transparency, accountability, and legitimacy of coastal governance. This research adopted a qualitative research approach, combining a qualitative evidence synthesis of existing research and a case-study of coastal governance on Palawan, the Philippines. The research focused on power dynamics within and between a peripheral island community and municipal/provincial meso-scale governance actors, with a specific focus on the rights and livelihoods of small-scale fishers. The research highlights how formal governance processes and outcomes intersect with existing power relations, and the cultural norms, customs, expectations, and obligations that structure the relationships between resource-users, politicians, and state bureaucrats. The research found that elite and marginal actors also construct framings of coastal governance which draw from, and align with, global conservation agendas and the macro-scale political discourse of an oligarchic elite and oppressed rural poor, characterised by narratives of suffering, hardship, corruption, and resistance. This research shows how polycentric governance can be characterised as a fluid system of relational power, as actors both cooperate and compete in pursuit of their respective goals and desired outcomes. Power can be used by dominant and marginal actors to both advance and undermine the equity, transparency, accountability, and legitimacy of coastal governance.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Carbon Capture and Storage and the Marine Environment: Impact assessment and assurance monitoring ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132242","Blackford, J","January 2023","Underground storage of CO2 as part of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) provides an option for significant reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power generation and other industrial processes as well as facilitating direct air capture. Although CCS will mitigate climate change, international regulations and societal expectations require that storage integrity is assured and environmental issues of deployment are considered, in particular related to the unplanned release of CO2. Globally many storage sites are located offshore within continental shelves, necessitating both a marine environmental impact assessment and an appropriate offshore monitoring strategy coupled with appropriate communication to enhance public understanding. This thesis by papers contains a body of work addressing both impact and monitoring challenges, primarily mediated using modelling approaches but also describing a novel real-world CO2 release experiment. The experiment revealed the previously unconsidered complexity of CO2 flow through and reactivity within sediments and behaviour in the water column. This work established the challenges associated with monitoring and detection informing further research programmes focused on increasing the technology readiness levels of sensors and developing monitoring strategies. As a result of the body of work presented here it is possible to constrain potential impacts, relative to leakage rates and conclude that only large-scale catastrophic leaks would have the capacity to inflict significant environmental damage. This work also identifies a potentially cost efficient and highly sensitive detection/assurance methodology, based on an understanding of leakage dynamics and natural variability of the marine system.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Transformation through participation: Democratising the human-ocean relationship ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132520","Buchan, PM","December 2022","This chapter situates marine citizenship as a transdisciplinary tool for transforming the human-ocean relationship for sustainability. It considers marine citizens’ views on knowledge, and the role in particular of scientific and local place-based knowledge for marine management, and how knowledge and learning influence and are a part of marine citizenship. Marine citizens, it will be argued, intuitively integrate a range of knowledges and seek participation in ocean governance both through formal procedural decision-making processes and through informal community-building means. In this analysis, the post-normal science approach is invoked, extending the marine environmental peer community to include citizens, and incorporating knowledges and values from outside of academia, in order to create more effective, acceptable and legitimate solutions to marine issues. Viewing all people as having a right to act as a marine citizen asks the question of how accessible marine citizenship is as a political, individual, and collective act. The argument is made that there is an existing knowledge deficit about the right to environmental procedural participation which ocean literacy could address, and that reform is required to enable this democratisation of the human-ocean relationship.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Accumulation of phycotoxins from HAB phytoplankton in filter-feeding shellfish can poison human consumers, prompting harvesting closures at shellfish production sites. To quantify long-term intoxication risk from Dinophysis HAB species, we used historical HAB monitoring data (2009–2020) to develop a new modelling approach to predict Dinophysis toxin concentrations in a range of bivalve shellfish species at shellfish sites in Western Scotland, South-West England and Northern France. A spatiotemporal statistical modelling framework was developed within the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework to quantify long-term HAB risks for different bivalve shellfish species across each region, capturing seasonal variations, and spatiotemporal interactions. In all regions spatial functions were most important for predicting seasonal HAB risk, offering the potential to inform optimal siting of new shellfish operations and safe harvesting periods for businesses. A 10-fold cross-validation experiment was carried out for each region, to test the models’ ability to predict toxin risk at harvesting locations for which data were withheld from the model. Performance was assessed by comparing ranked predicted and observed mean toxin levels at each site within each region: the correlation of ranks was 0.78 for Northern France, 0.64 for Western Scotland, and 0.34 for South-West England, indicating our approach has promise for predicting unknown HAB risk, depending on the region and suitability of training data.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Animal vision and colour change for camouflage ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/131779","Galloway, J","November 2022","Camouflage is a well-studied form of antipredator defence. A key issue is how animals ensure camouflage effectiveness when the visual environments many camouflage strategies rely on vary. Phenotypic plasticity allows animals to adjust coloration to best match such environmental variation. It is assumed that vision is used in identifying this variation and guides changes in colour. However, questions still exist regarding the opportunities and limitations afforded from vision-guided changes for camouflage. Carcinus maenas, the green shore crab, already a widely used species to investigate a variety of questions regarding camouflage, was used to test the assumption that vision is directly responsible for guiding (and limiting) colour change for camouflage. In the first chapter, tests of spectral sensitivity and colour discrimination were performed, which were then compared to colour change responses. Following this, crabs’ spatial resolution was tested and compared to pattern change responses on uniform and patterned backgrounds. Finally, crabs’ brightness change responses to varying illumination and substrate brightness conditions were recorded to examine directional light’s role in substrate perception for plasticity. My results indicate that C. maenas colour change for camouflage is determined and limited by their vision. First, spectral and colour discrimination results indicate C. maenas cannot perceive differences in colour. This aligns with colour change results, with crabs only showing significant achromatic change despite apparently possessing the chromatophores needed for chromatic change. Following this, crab’s changed patterning by increasing pattern contrast proportionate to background pattern size, without changing pattern shape or size. This change in patterning is indicative of a shift from uniform background matching to disruptive markings. Finally, C. maenas colour change corresponds to the relative reflectance of substrates, accounting for illumination. This indicates some level of assessment of directional light, likely dependent on the differential stimulation of an eye perceiving light from multiple directions at once. These results indicate that while species’ vision can limit colour change for camouflage, effective improvements in camouflage are still capable within these limits.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Realising these ambitions requires concerted, often innovative, political action across several policy domains. To understand the unique political challenges facing offshore wind deployment, this article presents a case study of the Republic of Ireland, where decades of sporadic political ambition to support offshore wind energy has not yet translated into commercial deployment. We use the Multiple Streams Framework to guide data collection, 29 elite interviews and extensive documentary analysis, and offer an historical explanation for why political actors did not meet long-standing market ambition. We analyse the battle of ideas between alternative policy approaches that emerge through distinct policy networks and institutions spanning marine planning, grid development, and energy price support. In Ireland, two key drivers restrained political support for offshore wind for over a decade: competition with onshore wind for limited grid connection capacity and resilience, and calibration of policy instruments to attain decadal renewable energy target at least cost. The study shows the value of a deviant case to demonstrate the political complexities of developing and adopting technology-specific policy instruments to support offshore wind energy in the context of long-term climate change targets, grid development, and grid system services plans.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Whilst mainly developed conceptually and implemented in Europe and North America, marine zoning is becoming a popular tool for addressing diverse coastal marine issues in the tropics. However, we know little about how it is being implemented in practice in that context. In this study, we analysed the factors and strategies that enable and hinder the establishment of marine zoning in the low-income tropics through a case study of the 26-year history of the development of the Environmental Critical Areas Network (ECAN) in Palawan, Philippines. We employed two participatory methods: Innovation Histories to investigate how implementation barriers and opportunities change over time, and the Net-Map method to reveal the social relations and power distributions that enabled, blocked, and stalled its implementation. We found that MSP can be durable in these contexts when institutionalised in national law and adopted by local co-coordinative bodies, yet it remains an externally-driven agenda. Our study shows that the scaling up of zoning does not necessarily help resolve conflicts around marine and coastal space, and highlights the importance and influence of the political economy on MSP implementation and outcomes. We conclude that MSP's insensitivity to contextual power relations and politics raises concerns over social inclusivity, equity and justice. Moving forward, MSP implemented in the tropics needs to make conflicts, trade-offs and power distributions explicit at the outset through participatory decision-making that involves and empowers all stakeholders from the early stages of initiatives.","Marine","University of Exeter"

To halt or reverse this decline they need protection both on land and at sea, requiring site-based conservation initiatives based on seabird abundance and diversity. The Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) programme is a method of identifying the most important places for birds based on globally agreed standardised criteria and thresholds. However, while great strides have been made identifying terrestrial sites, at-sea identification is lacking. The Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean, supports four terrestrial IBAs (tIBAs) and two proposed marine IBAs (mIBAs). The mIBAs are seaward extensions to breeding colonies based on outdated information and, other types of mIBA have not been explored. Here, we review the proposed seaward extension mIBAs using up-to-date seabird status and distribution information and, use global positioning system (GPS) tracking from Red-footed Booby Sula sula – one of the most widely distributed breeding seabirds on the archipelago – to identify any pelagic mIBAs. We demonstrate that due to overlapping boundaries of seaward extension to breeding colony and pelagic areas of importance there is a single mIBA in the central Indian Ocean that lays entirely within the Chagos Archipelago Marine Protected Area (MPA). Covering 62,379 km2 it constitutes ~10% of the MPA and if designated, would become the 11th largest mIBA in the world and 4th largest in the Indian Ocean. Our research strengthens the evidence of the benefits of large-scale MPAs for the protection of marine predators and provides a scientific foundation stone for marine biodiversity hotspot research in the central Indian Ocean.","Marine","University of Exeter"

It is therefore vitally important to increase our understanding of the impacts and risks of plastic pollution to marine ecosystems and the essential services they provide to support the development of mitigation measures in the region. An interdisciplinary, international network of experts (Australia, Indonesia, Ireland, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam) set a research agenda for marine plastic pollution in the region, synthesizing current knowledge and highlighting areas for further research in Southeast Asia. Using an inductive method, 21 research questions emerged under five non-predefined key themes, grouping them according to which: (1) characterise marine plastic pollution in Southeast Asia; (2) explore its movement and fate across the region; (3) describe the biological and chemical modifications marine plastic pollution undergoes; (4) detail its environmental, social, and economic impacts; and, finally, (5) target regional policies and possible solutions. Questions relating to these research priority areas highlight the importance of better understanding the fate of marine plastic pollution, its degradation, and the impacts and risks it can generate across communities and different ecosystem services. Knowledge of these aspects will help support actions which currently suffer from transboundary problems, lack of responsibility, and inaction to tackle the issue from its point source in the region. Being profoundly affected by marine plastic pollution, Southeast Asian countries provide an opportunity to test the effectiveness of innovative and socially inclusive changes in marine plastic governance, as well as both high and low-tech solutions, which can offer insights and actionable models to the rest of the world.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Marine plastics are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria, including human pathogens, posing potential risks to health. Here, we investigate the effect of polymer type, residence time and estuarine location on bacterial colonisation of common household plastics, including pathogenic bacteria. We submerged five main household plastic types: low-density PE (LDPE), high-density PE (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at an estuarine site in Cornwall (U.K.) and tracked bacterial colonisation dynamics. Using both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches, we found that bacteria rapidly colonised plastics irrespective of polymer type, reaching culturable densities of up to 1000 cells cm3 after 7 weeks. Community composition of the biofilms changed over time, but not among polymer types. The presence of pathogenic bacteria, quantified using the insect model Galleria mellonella, increased dramatically over a five-week period, with Galleria mortality increasing from 4% in week one to 65% in week five. No consistent differences in virulence were observed between polymer types. Pathogens isolated from plastic biofilms using Galleria enrichment included Serratia and Enterococcus species and they harboured a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our findings show that plastics in coastal waters are rapidly colonised by a wide diversity of bacteria independent of polymer type. Further, our results show that marine plastic biofilms become increasingly associated with virulent bacteria over time.","Marine","University of Exeter"

Discussion is included on heavy maintenance the implication for accurate weight control during operations. There are weight control challenges for the various substructure types during the temporary phases of construction and offshore installation.  An accurate assessment of the buoyancy of the floating wind turbine for different drafts and trims is required. Allowances need to be included in the weight calculation for temporary buoyancy, sea-fastenings and grillage.   Weight control for installation has an influence on the weather window for the floating substructures during transportation to the offshore site, and for their mooring and electrical connection.  The paper will cover weight calculation methods during early design, detailed design, construction, installation, operation and demolition.   The installation process for a floating wind turbine varies with substructure type and this paper will give an overview of the weight control requirements for loadout, ocean transport and mooring connection.  The floating offshore wind turbine weight and centre of gravity has a direct bearing on draft, intact stability and motions. As part of the weight control process the centre of gravity and radii of gyration need to be accurately determined for each stage of the installation.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Enhancing automated analysis of marine soundscapes using ecoacoustic indices and machine learning ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/129693","Williams, B; Lamont, TAC; Chapuis, L; et al.","May 2022","Historically, ecological monitoring of marine habitats has primarily relied on labour-intensive, non-automated survey methods. The field of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has demonstrated the potential of this practice to automate surveying in marine habitats. This has primarily been through the use of ‘ecoacoustic indices’ to quantify attributes from natural soundscapes. However, investigations using individual indices have had mixed success. Using PAM recordings collected at one of the world’s largest coral reef restoration programmes, we instead apply a machine-learning approach across a suite of ecoacoustic indices to improve predictive power of ecosystem health. Healthy and degraded reef sites were identified through live coral cover surveys, with 90–95% and 0–20% cover respectively. A library of one-minute recordings were extracted from each. Twelve ecoacoustic indices were calculated for each recording, in up to three different frequency bandwidths (low: 0.05–0.8 kHz, medium: 2–7 kHz and broad: 0.05–20 kHz). Twelve of these 33 index-frequency combinations differed significantly between healthy and degraded habitats. However, the best performing single index could only correctly classify 47% of recordings, requiring extensive sampling from each site to be useful. We therefore trained a regularised discriminant analysis machine-learning algorithm to discriminate between healthy and degraded sites using an optimised combination of ecoacoustic indices. This multi-index approach discriminated between these two habitat classes with improved accuracy compared to any single index in isolation. The pooled classification rate of 1000 cross-validated iterations of the model had a 91.7% 0.8, mean SE) success rate at correctly classifying individual recordings. The model was subsequently used to classify recordings from two actively restored sites, established >24 months prior to recordings, with coral cover values of 79.1% (±3.9) and 66.5% (±3.8). Of these recordings, 37/38 and 33/39 received a classification as healthy respectively. The model was also used to classify recordings from a newly restored site established <12 months prior with a coral cover of 25.6% (±2.6), from which 27/33 recordings were classified as degraded. This investigation highlights the value of combining PAM recordings with machine-learning analysis for ecological monitoring and demonstrates the potential of PAM to monitor reef recovery over time, reducing the reliance on labour-intensive in-water surveys by experts. As access to PAM recorders continues to rapidly advance, effective automated analysis will be needed to keep pace with these expanding acoustic datasets.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"High-throughput isolation and ecogenomics of phages infecting fastidious marine heterotrophic bacteria ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/129782","Buchholz, H","May 2022","Marine Bacteria and their associated viruses are key players in shaping microbial community structures and global biogeochemical cycles. Cell lysis through viral predation is a crucial component for the recycling of carbon compounds and other nutrients, and interaction between viruses and hosts can also alter cellular functions via metabolic ‘hijacking’. The culture-based study of phototrophic cyanobacterial virus-host systems has revealed that these constant co29 evolutionary pressures in virus-host systems are further escalated by virally mediate horizontal gene transfer. Viruses of fastidious, heterotrophic bacteria are among the most abundant and ecologically significant virus-host systems in the oceans, but the dearth of cultured model systems has hampered the progression in testing hypotheses and interpretation of meta’omics data. The central goal of this thesis was to establish efficient and high-throughput methodologies for viral isolation, specifically targeting fastidious heterotrophic microbes. Using a novel isolate of the ubiquitous SAR11 clade as a model for highly abundant hosts, and three novel isolates of the methylotrophic OM43 clade for a lower-abundance host, I devised an optimised workflow based on established Dilution-to-Extinction culturing techniques that resulted in the isolation of over 117 viruses. The results show that among these novel viruses were the first known siphoviruses of the SAR11 clade and the first recorded viruses infecting members of the OM43 clade. Genomic evidence by the Methylophilales phage Melnitz indicated that inter-class host transitioning between streamlined heterotrophs may occur, and highlighted unusual viral features such as curli genes and glutamine riboswitches. Furthermore, utilising the power of metagenomics coupled with culture based host range experiments, the Pelagibacter phage Skadi was revealed as a highly abundant polar virus, and as an example for ecotypic niche specificity among the most abundant viruses on Earth. Culture-based identification of virus-host pairs combined with ecogenomic interpretation of metagenomic data will improve our understanding of ecological patterns and of viral strategies. The results from this thesis illuminated parts of the viral “dark matter” and highlighted possible novel viral strategies.

However, there has been a lack of data investigating public perceptions of both the human health impacts from the marine environment, and public priorities for further OHH research. To explore these gaps, two large scale surveys were conducted as part of the current thesis; the pan-European Seas, Oceans and Public Health in Europe (SOPHIE) survey, collecting responses from 14 European countries with 14,167 respondents, and the Seas, Oceans and Public Health in Australia (SOPHIA) survey collecting a further 1,012 responses in Australia. Out of a range of potential threats, European and Australian respondents indicated that they were most concerned about the human health impacts of marine plastic pollution and expressed most support for research into better understanding the health implications of marine species protection. Further, given known heterogeneity among the public in terms of perceptions regarding other environmental issues (e.g. climate change), models were run to identify the individual-level characteristics predicting concern and research priority preferences. Quantifying attitudes, as well as understanding how individual-level differences shape concern and research preferences may enable policy makers and communicators to develop more targeted communications and initiatives aimed at reducing marine plastic pollution and tackling marine biodiversity loss.  * Some abstract data has been removed due to sensitivity.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Improving marine viral metagenomics through long read sequencing ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/128995","Warwick-Dugdale, J","March 2022","As arch manipulators of their host communities’, marine phages (viruses of bacteria) are key players in global biogeochemical cycles. Phage-mediated host lysis is a critical component of nutrient cycles and structures host communities. Horizontal gene transfer and co-evolution alter host-substrate interactions. Phages even ‘hijack’ their hosts, modifying host function to maximise virus production, or to improve host fitness for survival of the infected cell. Unfortunately investigation of marine viruses is hampered by the low proportion of hosts in culture and the resulting dearth of model host-virus systems. As phages lack a universal marker gene for PCR-based survey, metagenomic approaches have become the standard approach for assessments of viral community structure. However, viral ‘populations’ (equivalent: species) which are highly microdiverse (i.e. diverse at single nucleotide level) and/or replete with hypervariable regions (i.e. extremely variable regions within viral populations) fail to assemble from short-read metagenomic datasets. The central aim of this thesis was to leverage long-read sequencing technology for better characterisation of marine viral community diversity and structure. Here, I present ‘VirION’ (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing), a hybrid, short- and long-read sequencing and informatics workflow. After validation with mock viral communities, VirION was applied to both coastal (Western English Channel) and Open Ocean (Sargasso Sea) samples. The results here show that VirION captured: I). Many globally abundant and ubiquitous viruses missing from short-read metagenomic assemblies; II) Viral genomes that were more microdiverse and hypervariable-region rich than those in short-read assemblies; III) Hypervariable regions containing niche-defining genes of host origin, plus genes likely involved in host-virus interactions and host-hijacking; IV) Single-virus resolution in variations of viral hypervariable regions. Although this approach did not improve host-prediction, the identification of many previously ‘invisible’ viruses, including their host-virus interaction hotspots, improved characterisation of marine dsDNA phage communities, and should be used to guide future investigations of viral ecosystem function. Further development of VirION for the capture of cell-associated-, ssDNA and RNA viruses could provide a powerful tool for environmental monitoring whose scope goes beyond marine systems.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Quantifying habitat provisioning at macroalgal cultivation sites ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/128931","Corrigan, S; Brown, AR; Ashton, IGC; et al.","March 2022","Macroalgal cultivation is expanding rapidly, and promises to contribute significantly towards future food and energy security, sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem services and habitat provisioning for a range of associated organisms globally. Habitat provisioning underpins biodiversity and ecosystem structure and functioning, supports many ecosystem services and has possible benefits to other marine industries, including enhancement of commercial fish stocks. In macroalgal cultivation, however, only recently has habitat provisioning started to be assessed at a local scale (within a farm's footprint) and with a range of different approaches. This review evaluates techniques used to quantify habitat provisioning in and around macroalgal cultivation sites, for species ranging from microorganisms to megafauna, and outlines recommendations to enable a more comprehensive ecological valuation of macroalgal cultivation in the future. The majority of information on biodiversity associated with macroalgal cultivation is associated with quantifying biofouling or pest organisms, rather than the contribution of colonising species to healthy ecosystem functioning. We suggest how better monitoring of macroalgal cultivation could enable an ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) in the future. To achieve this, we highlight the need for standardised and robust methods for quantifying habitat provisioning that will enable assessment and monitoring of macroalgal cultivation sites of varying scales and within different regions and environmental settings. Increased evidence for the potential habitat value of macroalgal cultivation sites will help inform and shape marine legislation, licencing and certification for macroalgal farmers and potentially reduce marine user conflicts, helping the industry to continue to grow sustainably using EAA.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Network analysis of sea turtle movements and connectivity: A tool for conservation prioritization ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/128900","Kot, CY; Åkesson, S; Alfaro‐Shigueto, J; et al.","February 2022","Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of animal movements is a critical element in conserving long-lived, highly mobile marine species. Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts.  Location Global.  Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections.  Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links.  Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Reducing conservatism in highest density environmental contours ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/127932","Haselsteiner, AF; Mackay, E; Thoben, K-D","November 2021","Environmental contours are often used to define design loads acting on a marine structure. An environmental contour describes joint extremes of variables such as wave height, wave period and wind speed that are exceeded with a target return period. These extreme environmental conditions should lead to a structural response with a similar return period. Environmental contours can be defined based on different probabilistic definitions, one of them being that a contour surrounds a so-called highest density region. Highest density contours are a conservative concept that implies that any structure that is designed based on it will have an extreme response that has a return period that is higher than the contour’s return period (when short-term variability is accounted for). For some structures, however, the design loads are overly conservative because in the contour construction phase also environmental conditions, which will clearly not lead to an extreme response, are counted as exceedance. Here, we show how this over-conservatism can be avoided by predefining a region in the variable space that will not lead to extreme loads. We give an example where we define such “mild regions” for sea state contours. By assuming a structural response, we explore the effect of mild regions on the estimated extreme response. In the presented example, a normal highest density contour leads to a design response that is 13% too conservative, while a contour that is adjusted using a reasonable mild region can reduce conservatism to 7%.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"Exploring the benefits of a tropical, large-scale marine protected area for breeding seabirds, per mare, per terram ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/127773","Carr, P","November 2021","Debate continues in scientific and popular literature into the benefits of large scale marine protected areas (> 100,000 km2  - LSMPAs), especially for top  predators. Of top marine predators, seabirds are deemed to be the easiest to  study due to their ease of observation and often colonial breeding. The  Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) programme is a method of  identifying the most important places for birds. IBAs are identified using a  globally agreed standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds. In this  thesis I explore the benefits of a LSMPA for top predators. I use IBAs on land  and at sea with seabirds as the qualifying species as the means of exploration  and the tropical British Indian Ocean Territory (Chagos) MPA (hereafter BIOT  MPA) as the study system. Red-footed Booby Sula sula rubripes is the focal  species of the thesis.  My research demonstrates that the BIOT MPA is extremely important regionally  and globally for biodiversity and provides a breeding sanctuary for ≈ 282,000  pairs of seabirds of 18 species annually, four of which breed in internationally  important numbers that trigger IBA status. However, invasive Ship Rats Rattus  rattus and abandoned coconut Cocos nucifera plantations are severely  restricting the islands that seabirds can breed on. I calculate by eradicating rats  and managing invasive coconut plantations on a single 123 ha island, the  number of seabirds breeding in the BIOT MPA could more than double. At sea,  I identified sites that meet IBA status and due to their overlapping boundaries  form a single ‘super’ IBA that covers ≈ 10% of the MPA.  The terrestrial and marine sites I have identified within the MPA warrant  enhanced protection. Red-footed Booby is deemed an umbrella species and  therefore protecting the feeding and breeding habitat of this species will afford  protection on a suite of other species, including sub-surface predators. I  suggest this thesis is a foundation stone from which further research into marine  biodiversity hotspots in the central Indian Ocean can be launched. This thesis  supports the growing evidence that tropical LSMPAs are beneficial to top  predators and unequivocally demonstrates that the BIOT MPA encompasses  the early stages of breeding of a highly mobile, top predator.","Marine","University of Exeter"

As such, there is still a lack of mature standards and guidance for the development and testing of these devices. The sector covers a wide range of disciplines, so there is a need for more comprehensive guidance to cover these. This paper builds on a study undertaken in the MaRINET2 project to summarise recommendations and guidance for testing MRE devices and components, by reviewing recently published guidance. Perceived gaps in guidance are then discussed, expanding on the previous study. Results from an industry survey are also used to help quantify and validate these gaps. The main themes identified can be summarised as: the development progression from concept to commercialisation, including more complex environmental conditions in testing, accurately modelling and quantifying the power generated including grid integration, plus modelling and testing of novel moorings and foundation solutions. A pathway towards a standardised approach for MRE testing is presented, building on recommendations learnt from the MaRINET2 round robin testing; showing how these recommendations are being incorporated into guidance and ultimately feeding into the development of international standards for the marine renewable energy sector.","Marine","University of Exeter"
"The War at Sea: Trafalgar and Beyond ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/126284","Davey, JP","December 2022","This chapter argues that the conflict at sea was an important and frequently overlooked part of the Napoleonic Wars. Focusing primarily on the Royal Navy and French maritime forces, but also mentioning the navies of Spain, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and United States, it outlines the manifold ways in which maritime warfare shaped wider events on land, and helped determine the conflict’s final outcome. It demonstrates that French attempts to invade Britain were successfully rebuffed by the Royal Navy, ensuring that Britain remained in the conflict. The chapter then offers a more modern take on the commonly misunderstood Battle of Trafalgar, arguing that it was far from decisive and did little to change the course of the war. The naval conflict continued in earnest after 1805, and the war of trade became all-consuming, particularly after the inception of ‘Napoleon’s Continental system’. Here the navy offered a stubborn resistance to the French Emperor’s objectives, helping to encourage illicit trade with the European continent while also expanding Britain’s empire and mercantilist reach elsewhere in the globe. Finally, it demonstrates that maritime support was crucial to the land war, not least Wellington’s Peninsula campaign.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The birth of naval history: audience and objectivity in British eighteenth-century historical writing ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/126231","Davey, J","January 2021","During the early decades of the eighteenth century the first general naval histories were published in Britain. Individuals from a range of backgrounds claimed ownership of this new and burgeoning subject, all professing to have produced the most reliable and accurate histories of the navy. Their competing publications provoked considerable debate, with authors drawn into fighting a war of words in the national press. These disputes raised important questions about the study of the past. Who should write naval history? How should it be written? Who was it written for? This article places naval history in the broader context of British politics, society and culture, investigating three works of naval history published between 1720 and 1735. It analyses their authorship and intended audience, suggesting that the production of these works was a symptom of a society quickly becoming enamoured with its naval past, and keen to record and disseminate this history. In addition, this article will explore the debates over objectivity, expertise and authority that were central to discussions over who should write naval history. In doing so, it contributes to a broader historiography that considers the development of the historical profession in the early eighteenth century.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Changes and challenges: The Royal Navy's China Station and Britain's East Asian empire during the 1920s ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/37423","Heaslip, M","June 2019","Examining Britain’s position in 1920s East Asia at a point amid changes in the international balance of power, this thesis bridges the gap between the existing imperial and naval accounts of a key transition point in global history. In doing so, it focuses upon the foremost organisation involved in maintaining and supporting the peripheral regions of imperial influence, the Royal Navy’s China Station. The thesis provides an important new segment to help in explaining the wider story of the slow decline of British imperial and naval dominance in the 1920s. Foremost among the findings is an emphasis on how heavily inter-related Britain’s strategies for China and Japan were during the decade. Indeed, China was expected by the Admiralty to play a pivotal role in any future relationship between the British Empire and the increasingly expansionist Japan, which adds a significant new angle to existing discussion of Britain’s far eastern defence strategy. Providing fresh insights into how those grand strategies were implemented in practice, the thesis shows how naval officers serving in the region willingly and repeatedly deviated from official policy on a day-to-day basis in order to assist their counterparts from friendly powers. Likewise, the evolving threats posed by state and sub-state actors in China are shown to have led to the deployment of vast Royal Navy task force to Shanghai in 1927, which is now generally overlooked and misunderstood. That event marked the last time Britain was able to confidently display its global naval dominance to the world. Among the more controversial findings, the thesis reveals how the Admiralty secretly circumvented the Washington Treaty by developing military aviation capabilities at Hong Kong under the guise of imperial policing. In doing so it provides the first clear evidence that alongside Germany and Japan, Britain was also actively contravening the post-1918 disarmament treaties it had only recently signed. Away from preparations for another major conflict, the thesis also provides a fresh examination of the contrasting accounts of two violent clashes involving Britain in 1920s China. In doing so, the thesis shows that it is possible to establish a more balanced understanding of events such as the Nanjing and Wanxian incidents, despite the highly polarised accounts of what happened. Finally, the human side of the story is explored, during which the thesis discusses changing attitudes towards and use of Victorian gunboat diplomacy. Moreover, the stresses of commanding gunboats in such isolated circumstances are shown to have pushed some young officers beyond breaking point, with disastrous consequences for themselves and others. Archival material that is entirely new to histories of the Royal Navy has been used throughout the thesis, adding crucial details such as the important role of Treaty Port volunteer corps in influencing warship deployments. Likewise, by delving deep into the naval archives, the thesis helps to move the imperial histories beyond the wall of steel and blue uniforms to consider the Royal Navy as a complex entity containing a diverse set of individuals. In combination the thesis provides the first detailed examination of the Royal Navy’s everyday work maintaining the British Empire in East Asia against the wider backdrop of the transformative changes in world geopolitics.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Serving the State: empire, expertise and the British hemp crisis, 1800-1801 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/32689","Davey, JP","March 2018","This article investigates a governmental committee set up in 1800 to address a long-standing problem faced by the British state: how to procure a reliable and cost-effective supply of hemp. This resource, on which the Royal Navy and mercantile marine relied, could be procured only from the Russian territories of northern Europe, a dependence that had proved precarious and increasingly unreliable in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. In 1800, amid a great European war, the supply of hemp was permanently stopped by the Russian tsar, and the British government formed a committee charged with finding new sources of this material, debating which regions should be invested in and encouraging future cultivation. The investigation that followed was truly global in its scope, focusing overwhelmingly on the resources of the British Empire, as botany, agriculture and the global acquisition of resources became issues of governmental concern. The investigation also forced the British state to look beyond its own departments, as numerous civilian, mercantile and agricultural experts were brought in to give evidence and offer suggestions. Studying this committee presents an opportunity to analyse how the state worked to solve problems and how it considered various (and often competing) notions of expertise and authority, as various individuals were called in to serve. Additionally, it demonstrates how people inside and outside government conceived of the broader utility and purpose of the British Empire at the turn of the nineteenth century.","Navy","University of Exeter"

It also studies the language of these ballads, to show how they shaped ideas about the navy, and in turn assess their role in naval recruitment. By considering the social–cultural milieu in which decisions about volunteering took place, it argues that patriotism, duty and identity played an important role in encouraging men to join the navy.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Laird Rams: Warships in Transition 1862-1885 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/24286","English, Andrew Ramsey","April 2016","The Laird rams, built from 1862-1865, reflected concepts of naval power in transition from the broadside of multiple guns, to the rotating turret with only a few very heavy pieces of ordnance.  These two ironclads were experiments built around the two new offensive concepts for armoured warships at that time: the ram and the turret.  These sister armourclads were a collection of innovative designs and compromises packed into smaller spaces.  A result of the design leap forward was they suffered from too much, too soon, in too limited a hull area.  The turret ships were designed and built rapidly for a Confederate Navy desperate for effective warships.  As a result of this urgency, the pair of twin turreted armoured rams began as experimental warships and continued in that mode for the next thirty five years.  They were armoured ships built in secrecy, then floated on the Mersey under the gaze of international scrutiny and suddenly purchased by Britain to avoid a war with the United States.  Once purchased, they were largely forgotten.  Historians rarely mention these two sister ironclads and if mentioned at all, they are given short shrift.  Built with funds obtained in part through the Confederate Erlanger loan, these ironclads were constructed at Lairds shipyard in Birkenhead and represented an advanced concept of ironclad construction through new proposals involving turrets, the ram, heavy guns and tripod masts on an armoured ship, as advocated by Captain Cowper Coles, R.N.  They proved too much of a leap in one design but when their roles caught up to the revised designs, the ships were modified to meet new requirements.  After several mission and design changes they then performed to standard. This belated success occurred when the concept of the ideal armoured warship was in flux throughout the middle Victorian years.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Vikings and victories: sea stories from ‘The seafarer’ to Skyfall and the future of British maritime culture ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/16695","Gibson, Marion","May 2015","In 2011 Nick Harvey, Communication and Campaigns manager for Seafarers UK,  wrote an article for the Maritime Foundation deploring what he called ‘alarming ignorance of our island nation’s dependence on the sea’: ‘Our nationwide survey revealed that general maritime knowledge amongst the public at large is severely lacking, and ‘sea blindness’ is a huge problem’, he stated. Knowledge of Britain’s past and present seafarers appeared patchy and a character from American film was identified by some as Britain’s greatest seaman. But why might Britain have become ‘sea-blind’, as the survey results suggest? Building on Harvey’s claim that the fictional Jack Sparrow has replaced Alfred the Great and Nelson as a national maritime icon, this article seeks to demonstrate the close connection between literary culture, the politics of identity and the fortunes of the British seafaring tradition, especially its navy. The representation of seafarers in a literary trend is seen to be an accurate indicator of the nation’s attitude to maritime activities at any given time. Bringing together interdisciplinary perspectives, the article suggests that the impact of literary and filmic depictions is more important than has been recognised: opinion formers are likely to be influenced by such depictions rather than or alongside overt arguments about hardware or policy.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Elite Discourse on the Political Economy of the Royal Navy and British Naval Sea Power: New Public Management Theory as  Modernisation - Back to the Future ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/15369","Granfield, Mark Howard","January 2014","At the beginning of the twenty-first century a burgeoning global private military sector is increasingly involved in areas of defence and security that, up until recently, were popularly thought of as being within the monopolistic preserve of the nation state. Finding itself at the vanguard of profound political and economic change, today’s Royal Navy is increasingly reliant on relationships with the private sector that only thirty years ago would have seemed unimaginable to many commentators. As naval shipbuilding, dockyard refitting, logistics, training, and even warship ownership and manning, move from a unitary state to an increasingly self-organising private sector bounded by a differentiated and decentered polity, this thesis is concerned with boundaries of elite discourse on legitimacy in the political economy of Royal Navy and British naval sea power and their implications for New Public Management theory. At its core, the study presents original research into the attitudes of fifty elite opinion formers directly concerned with the discourse of Royal Navy modernisation and profiles their ideational boundaries concerning the political economy of force and violence.   The thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge by presenting empirically and framing theoretically the ways in which elite naval attitudes to the political economy of legitimated force have changed and are evolving. The research is important because it challenges what many commentators have come to believe to be an a priori function of the nation state, namely, the monopoly use of force, with the actual views of those opinion formers who currently hold positions of power and influence in and around one of its core ‘ideal type’ institutions: the Royal Navy. The research is also significant because in attempting to clarify the conceptual boundaries of this elite discourse, it also presents a powerful critique of New Public Management with reference to the problematic dimensions of time, economic complexity and socio-political power.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Invasion Question: Admiralty plans to defend the British Isles, 1888-1918 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/13581","Morgan-Owen, David Gethin","July 2013","This thesis presents a new analysis of British naval policy before and during the First World War which challenges both orthodox and revisionist interpretations of the period and highlights a highly significant yet much neglected facet of Admiralty planning. It argues that safeguarding the British Isles from invasion was one of the Admiralty’s prime concerns between 1888 and 1918 and that these defensive considerations played a hitherto unappreciated role in shaping British naval strategy. By exploiting source material generally overlooked by previous writers, it demonstrates that, contrary to popular historical belief, Britain’s naval leadership planned extensively to ensure the inviolability of the British coastline during this period. Before 1900, these plans were characterized by relying upon an extensive flotilla of small vessels, supported by a small number of old armoured warships, to secure the position in the Channel and North Sea, while the Navy’s most modern warships focused upon the main French Fleet in the Mediterranean. The Admiralty’s willingness to rely primarily upon flotilla craft for home defence ended after 1900, however, when German displaced France as Britain’s primary naval rival. Germany posed a very different threat to Britain than had previously been the case with France, since it possessed a merchant marine large enough to transport a significant military force without major disruption to the normal operation of its commerce and had her naval forces concentrated in northern waters. Despite the paucity of German planning for the invasion of the United Kingdom, the Admiralty became haunted by the possibility of a ‘surprise’ German invasion attempt, launched before the outset of war and escorted by a strong German Fleet. The Admiralty identified the danger of a surprise German raid or invasion by early 1907 and formed a series of highly secretive plans to deploy the Navy’s most modern armoured warships into the North Sea at the outset of war to meet this danger. These plans were updated constantly between 1910 and 1918 as perceptions of the German threat developed. The nature and extent of these plans has highly significant implications for our understanding of naval policy throughout the period, and for our appreciation of the role of sea power during the First World War.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"‘Stokers-the lowest of the low?' A Social History of Royal Navy Stokers 1850–1950 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/13844","Chamberlain, Tony","March 2013","‘Stokers-the lowest of the low?' A Social History of Royal Navy Stokers 1850–1950 The introduction of steam propulsion during the early nineteenth century presented the Royal Navy with two interlinked challenges. In the first, steam propulsion had to overcome the sceptics and the challenges of technical development until it proved a reliable and superior alternative to sail. The second was a challenge to the social infrastructure of the Navy which struggled to integrate increasingly large numbers of engine room personnel into a traditional close knit naval hierarchy dominated by seamen. The engineers’ struggle for commissioned status and equality with the executive branch is well documented, as is the history of the engine room artificers’ branch. By comparison, where naval and historical custom has promoted and celebrated the ideal of the Royal Naval ‘bluejacket’ or seaman, its stokers have become subjects of censure while their story has been largely ignored and corrupted by prejudice and myths. Tradition dictates that stokers are portrayed as coarse, uneducated men with a reputation for being trouble makers. As a result, they were judged to have the worst discipline record on the lower-deck. Because of the physical nature of their work and the filth and detritus from the coal they worked with they were also commonly believed to originate from the lowest classes of contemporary society. Yet without stokers no ship could leave harbour let alone engage the enemy. Every item of machinery and equipment onboard a ship relied on the steam produced by stokers. But far from being seen as equals or given any credit for their endeavours in the miniature hell of the stokehole, stokers became social outcasts. No other branch of men in the Navy has been subjected to such longstanding and deep seated censure. The negative stereotypes which surround stokers continue to perpetuate a disservice to a much overlooked and maligned branch of men. In order to determine the reasons why stokers attracted such negative sympathies this thesis will separate the facts from the myths and offer a new perspective on the men condemned by history as ‘the lowest of the low.’","Navy","University of Exeter"
"To the Nadir and Back: The Executive Branch of the Royal Navy 1918-1939 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/4451","Farquharson-Roberts, Michael Atholl","October 2012","The Royal Navy, and especially its leadership, is perceived to have performed poorly in the First World War and its officers have been described as being automatons who only came alive when directed by superiors. By contrast in the Second World War the Royal Navy and its officers are seen as having ‘done well,’ displaying flair and initiative. There does not appear to have been any attempt to look in any detail at what, if anything, changed in the twenty years between the wars to explain the perceived improvement. This thesis critically examines the executive branch of the Royal Navy, and contends that the navy adapted and modified the training of its officers to meet whatever was required of them; when they were required to passively obey orders as in the Grand Fleet of the First World War, they had been trained for that eventuality, when to show initiative likewise.   During the 1920s the officer corps was mismanaged and morale and motivation suffered badly. The influence of the Admiralty civil service, the repository of institutional memory, which managed junior officers’ careers, was conservative and resistant to change. Changes in training both before and after the mutiny at Invergordon (September 1931) brought the officer corps up to date and set it on track for its outstanding performance in the next war, in particular recognising that leadership was not an innate class based ability, but had to be taught and developed. However, the navy had since the latter part of the nineteenth century changed the emphasis of officer’s career paths; specialist training was seen as the ‘route to the top’ and command was downgraded as a necessary part of an officer’s career development. It was only during the latter part of Second World War that having exercised command at sea was recognised as being an important part of an officer’s experience.   The thesis also addresses the ‘RNVR myth’ that the Royal Navy was only able to prosecute the Second World War successfully because of an influx of well educated temporary officers and that they were the major driving force.   This thesis has been largely based on primary sources, including personnel records which have not been studied before and have been examined in such a way as to allow statistical analysis.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"Selection and Early Career Education of Executive Officers in the Royal Navy c1902-1939 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/10701","Romans, Elinor Frances","March 2012","This thesis is concerned with the selection and early career education of executive branch officers in the Royal Navy c1902-1939. The thesis attempts to place naval selection and educational policy in context by demonstrating how it was affected by changing naval requirements, external political interference and contemporary educational reform. It also explores the impact of the First World War and the Invergordon mutiny upon officer education. The thesis discusses the selection of potential executive officers, exploring what methods were used, why they were used and how they were developed over time. It discusses the increasing openness of the officer corps of the Royal Navy to boys of talent, irrespective of their background; and shows that this trend was driven by political demand, fuelled by the increasing number of well educated lower middle class boys, and welcomed by many in the Royal Navy. The thesis demonstrates that the Fisher-Selborne Scheme of officer education combined existing naval practice with recent educational developments to produce a unique and innovatory educational system. It shows how many of the assumptions on which the scheme was founded were subsequently proven to be wrong, and demonstrates its gradual dismantling through the inter-war years.  The thesis considers the development of the Special Entry scheme, initially in response to a shortage of junior officers but later as a means of broadening entry to the officer corps. It contrasts the fortunes of the two schemes in the inter-war period, in which the educational side of the Special Entry scheme was largely unaltered. Overall the thesis seeks to place the development of the Royal Navy’s systems for the selection and early career education of executive officers in context by exploring how and why they were developed and their response to the changing fortunes and shape of the Royal Navy.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Navy in the English Civil War ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/4078","Lea-O'Mahoney, Michael James","September 2011","This thesis is concerned chiefly with the military role of sea power during the English Civil War. Parliament’s seizure of the Royal Navy in 1642 is examined in detail, with a discussion of the factors which led to the King’s loss of the fleet and the consequences thereafter. It is concluded that Charles I was outmanoeuvred politically, whilst Parliament’s choice to command the fleet, the Earl of Warwick, far surpassed him in popularity with the common seamen. The thesis then considers the advantages which control of the Navy provided for Parliament throughout the war, determining that the fleet’s protection of London, its ability to supply besieged outposts and its logistical support to Parliamentarian land forces was instrumental in preventing a Royalist victory. Furthermore, it is concluded that Warwick’s astute leadership went some way towards offsetting Parliament’s sporadic neglect of the Navy.  	The thesis demonstrates, however, that Parliament failed to establish the unchallenged command of the seas around the British Isles. This was because of the Royalists’ widespread privateering operations, aided in large part by the King’s capture of key ports in 1643, such as Dartmouth and Bristol. The Navy was able to block many, but not all, of the King’s arms shipments from abroad, thus permitting Charles to supply his armies in England. Close attention is paid to the Royalist shipping which landed reinforcements from Ireland in 1643-44.  	The King’s defeat in the First Civil War is then discussed, with the New Model Army, and greater resources, cited as the key factors behind Parliament’s victory, with recognition that the Navy provided essential support. Finally, the revolt of the fleet in 1648 is examined. It is concluded that the increasing radicalism of Parliament alienated a substantial section of the Navy, but that the Royalists failed to capitalise on their new-found maritime strength.","Navy","University of Exeter"
"The Health of British Seamen in the West Indies, 1770 - 1806 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/3918","Convertito, Coriann","August 2011","This thesis examines the impact of disease and mortality on the Royal Navy in the West Indies from 1770 to 1806.  It also investigates the navy’s medical branch which was established to manage the care of sick seamen.  Using an interdisciplinary approach, this thesis produces a cohesive understanding of how disease and mortality affected the navy’s presence in the West Indies and the ways in which the navy attempted to mitigate their impact.  This thesis explores various aspects of naval medicine including the history of the Sick and Hurt Board, the diseases which distressed seamen, the medicines distributed by the navy, the key personnel who were integral in generating changes to the medical system and the development of hospital facilities. Largely based on Admiralty records including correspondence and minutes from the Sick and Hurt Board, ships’ muster books and surgeons’ journals, this thesis investigates the most prevalent diseases in the West Indies and the prescribed treatments advocated by the navy.  It then examines how these diseases and treatments affected seamen on board ships in that region through a quantitative analysis; then focuses on a number of the integral naval personnel who ushered in sweeping changes to naval medicine; and explores the navy’s increasing desire to transition from hired sick quarters to purpose-built naval hospitals on various West Indies islands.  It concludes with a case study of the development of Antigua naval hospital which demonstrates the effectiveness of these facilities in convalescing sick seamen. Through a quantitative analysis of ships’ muster books, this thesis argues that the levels of sickness and mortality in the navy in the West Indies during the late eighteenth century are largely exaggerated in historical studies while also discrediting the myth that those islands were the ‘white man’s graveyard’ for many naval personnel.  By surveying over 100,000 seamen on board ships in that region, sickness and mortality figures emerge which indicate that, on average, less than 4 per cent of seamen were on the sick list at any given time and only a small percentage died, meaning that the majority remained on active duty.  This thesis then argues that many of the changes to the navy’s medical system that facilitated such low percentages were primarily instigated by surgeons, physicians and captains who identified beneficial medicines and championed their general distribution among the entire fleet.  By looking at these aspects of naval medicine through a multidisciplinary lens rather than a purely administrative one, it is possible to understand the true state of health of British seamen in the West Indies during the last quarter of the eighteenth century.","Navy","University of Exeter"

"British personnel in the Dutch navy, 1642-1697 ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10036/67714","Little, Andrew Ross","May 2008","An international maritime labour market study, the thesis focuses on the Dutch naval labour market, analysing wartime Zeeland admiralty crews.  The research is based primarily on unique naval pay sources.  Analysis of crew compositions has not been made on this scale in the period before.  The 1667 Dutch Medway Raid is the starting point, where a few British played a leading role – amongst many others reported on the Dutch side.  Pepys and Marvell primarily blamed their joining the enemy on the lure of superior Dutch payment.  The thesis asks how many British there were really, how they came to be in Dutch service, and whether this involvement occurred, as indicated, at other times too.   Part One is thematic and explores the background mechanisms of the maritime environment in detail, determining causation.  First, the two naval recruitment systems are compared and completely reassessed in the light of state intervention in the trade sphere.  Two new sets of ‘control’ data – naval wages and foreign shipping – are amongst the incentives and routes determined.  British expatriate communities are examined as conduits for the supply of naval labour and civilian support.  British personnel are compared and contrasted with other foreigners, against the background of Anglo-Dutch interlinkage and political transition from neutrality through conflict to alliance.  Part Two is chronological, covering four major wars in three chapters.  Micro-case studies assembled from the scattered record streams enable analysis of the crews of particular officers and ships.  Seamen were an occupation that made them a very little known group: the thesis examines the different career types of British personnel of many different ranks, shedding light on their everyday lives.  The thesis shows that British personnel were an integral part of Dutch crews throughout the period, even when the two nations were fighting each other.  The basic need of subsistence labour for employment took precedence over allegiance to nation/ideology, demonstrating limitations in state power and the continual interdependence forced on the maritime powers through the realities of the labour market.","Navy","University of Exeter"

"Algorithmic profiling as a source of hermeneutical injustice ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/135158","Milano, S; Prunkl, C","January 2024","It is well-established that algorithms can be instruments of injustice. It is less frequently discussed, however, how current modes of AI deployment often make the very discovery of injustice difficult, if not impossible. In this article, we focus on the effects of algorithmic profiling on epistemic agency. We show how algorithmic profiling can give rise to epistemic injustice through the depletion of epistemic resources that are needed to interpret and evaluate certain experiences. By doing so, we not only demonstrate how the philosophical conceptual framework of epistemic injustice can help pinpoint potential, systematic harms from algorithmic profiling, but we also identify a novel source of hermeneutical injustice that to date has received little attention in the relevant literature: epistemic fragmentation. As we explain below, epistemic fragmentation is a structural characteristic of algorithmically-mediated environments that isolate individuals, making it more difficult to develop, uptake and apply new epistemic resources. This, in turn, can impede the identification and conceptualisation of emerging harms in these environments. We trace the occurrence of hermeneutical injustice back to the fragmentation of the epistemic experiences of individuals, who are left more vulnerable by the inability to share, compare, and learn from shared experiences.","AI","University of Exeter"
"The rise of AI urbanism in post-smart cities: A critical commentary on urban artificial intelligence ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/134542","Cugurullo, F; Caprotti, F; Cook, M; et al.","November 2023","Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as an impactful feature of the life, planning and governance of 21st-century cities. Once confined to the realm of science fiction and small-scale technological experiments, AI is now all around us, in the shape of urban artificial intelligences including autonomous cars, robots, city brains and urban software agents. The aim of this article is to critically examine the nature of urbanism in the emergent age of AI. More specifically, we shed light on how urban AI is impacting the development of cities, and argue that an urbanism influenced by AI, which we term AI urbanism, differs in theory and practice from smart urbanism. In the future, the rise of a post-smart urbanism driven by AI has the potential to form autonomous cities that transcend, theoretically and empirically, traditional smart cities. The article compares common practices and understandings of smart urbanism with emerging forms of urban living, urban governance and urban planning influenced by AI. It critically discusses the limitations and potential pitfalls of AI urbanism and offers conceptual tools and a vocabulary to understand the urbanity of AI and its impact on present and future cities.","AI","University of Exeter"
"Role of substantive and rhetorical signals in the market reaction to announcements on AI adoption: A configurational study ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/133674","Nishant, R; Nguyen, TK; Teo, TSH; et al.","August 2023","How do shareholders respond to technologies hyped in general discourse, e.g. artificial intelligence (AI), if a common understanding is lacking and the technologies are still evolving? Do they respond primarily to substantive signals in technology announcements, such as AI capabilities, or do rhetorical signals also play a significant role? Adopting signalling theory as a theoretical lens, we conceptualise announcements of AI capabilities as substantive signals and linguistic elements in the announcements pertaining to organisational time horizon and risk- reward considerations as rhetorical signals. Departing from the typical focus on bijective relationships, we consider holistic, complex configurations of interdependent factors using the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) methodology. Notably, announcements pertaining to AI capabilities are not necessarily associated with positive market reactions; in fact, when all three types of AI are included in announcements without explicit consideration of risks, shareholders react negatively. We find that shareholder response is based on joint evaluation of substantive and rhetorical signals, and that these signals interact in a complex way to produce positive and negative market reactions. These findings motivate several propositions for market reactions to IT announcements, providing implications for both theory and practice.","AI","University of Exeter"

"Taking Words Literally: Cratylism in the Post-Truth Age ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132838","Pragier, D","April 2023","Since 2016, the term “post-truth” has become ubiquitous in news-reporting as a catch-all for the present age: a time of seemingly unprecedented mistrust over public truth, and the deliberate weaponisation of this uncertainty. While the consequences of this state are widely discussed, for example during political election campaigns and global health crises such as COVID-19, a clear understanding of its systemic causes is more tenuous. Consequentially, the post-truth state may even be viewed as a distinctly contemporary phenomenon, for which there is no historical precedent. This thesis rejects such a notion. In its two chapters, ‘truth’ and ‘reality’ are explored as expressions of language and, ultimately, as constructs, ideas which have existed in philosophical and spiritual texts for thousands of years. The study begins with Plato’s Cratylus, and traces a path through history to the 20th century and into the post-truth age. It considers scholars and ideas including Genette’s fallen language, Wittgenstein’s beetle in a box, Benjamin’s sphere of art, Heidegger’s origins of art, Cassirer’s myth of the state, Boorstin’s image state, and Baudrillard’s hyperreality. By doing so, this thesis refutes the notion that the post-truth age exists in isolation by presenting it as the logical development of long-standing debates as to the natures of reality, art, and truth. Further, it considers the ongoing role of writer, across media and form, in investigating these natures, using their works as sites of exercise. As a result of this study, two key conclusions are drawn: (1) our current language system is no longer able to adequately describe its surrounding world; (2) societal misunderstandings as to the nature (or existence) of “objective truth” and “objective reality”, intensified by ever-expanding media systems, will inevitably lead to consequences synonymous with those of “post-truth”. If society wishes to alleviate such consequences of the post-truth age, this thesis suggests that these two root causes must first be addressed.","AI","University of Exeter"
"Voicing Kinship with Machines: Diffractive Empathetic Listening to Synthetic Voices in Performance. ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132253","Bentivegna, F","January 2023","This thesis contributes to the field of voice studies by analyzing the design and production of synthetic voices in performance. The work explores six case studies, consisting of different performative experiences of the last decade (2010- 2020) that featured synthetic voice design. It focusses on the political and social impact of synthetic voices, starting from yet challenging the concepts of voice in the machine and voice of the machine. The synthetic voices explored are often playing the role of simulated artificial intelligences, therefore this thesis expands its questions towards technology at large. The analysis of the case studies follows new materialist and posthumanist premises, yet it tries to confute the patriarchal and neoliberal approach towards technological development through feminist and de-colonial approaches, developing a taxonomy for synthetic voices in performance. Chapter 1 introduces terms and explains the taxonomy. Chapter 2 looks at familiar representations of fictional AI. Chapter 3 introduces headphone theatre exploring immersive practices. Chapters 4 and 5 engage with chatbots. Chapter 6 goes in depth exploring Human and Artificial Intelligence interaction, whereas chapter 7 moves slightly towards music production and live art. The body of the thesis includes the work of Pipeline Theatre, Rimini Protokoll, Annie Dorsen, Begüm Erciyas, and Holly Herndon. The analysis is informed by posthumanism, feminism, and performance studies, starting from my own practice as sound designer and singer, looking at aesthetics of reproduction, audience engagement, and voice composition. This thesis has been designed to inspire and provoke practitioners and scholars to explore synthetic voices further, question predominant biases of binarism and acknowledge their importance in redefining technology.","AI","University of Exeter"

From memorials and shrines to photos and saved voicemail messages, we engage with the dead through the technologies available to us. As our technologies evolve, so does how we grieve. In this paper, we consider the role chatbots might play in our grieving practices. Influ-enced by recent phenomenological work, we begin by thinking about the character of grief. Next, we consider work on developing ‘con-tinuing bonds’ with the dead. We argue that, for some, chatbots may play an important role in establishing these continuing bonds by help-ing us develop what we term ‘habits of intimacy’. We then turn to the ‘ick factor’ some may feel about this prospect, focusing especially on ethical concerns raised by Patrick Stokes and Adam Buben about the risk of replacing our dead with chatbots. We argue that replacement worries are not as pressing as Stokes and Buben suggest. We resist these replacement worries by appealing to the ‘thin reciprocity’, as we refer to it, that such bots offer, as well as the fictionalist stance that we think users of the bots adopt when engaging with them. We conclude by briefly raising some additional concerns and highlighting future research questions.","AI","University of Exeter"

"An energy-efficient and trustworthy unsupervised anomaly detection framework (EATU) for IIoT ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/131337","Huang, Z; Wu, Y; Tempini, N; et al.","June 2022","Many anomaly detection techniques have been adopted by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for improving self-diagnosing efficiency and infrastructures security. However, they are usually associated with the issues of computational-hungry and “black box”. Thus, it becomes important to ensure that the detection is not only accurate but also energy-efficient and trustworthy. In this paper, we propose an Energy-efficient And Trustworthy Unsupervised anomaly detection framework (EATU) for IIoT. The framework consists of two levels of feature extraction: 1) Autoencoder-based feature extraction and 2) Efficient DeepExplainer-based explainable feature selection. We propose an Efficient DeepExplainer model based on perturbation-focused sampling which demonstrates the most computational efficiency, amongst state-of-the-art explainable models. With the important features selected by Efficient DeepExplainer, the rationale of why an anomaly detection decision was made is given, enhancing the trustworthiness of the detection as well as improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. Three real-world IIoT datasets with high-dimensional features are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that in comparison with the state-of-the-art, our framework has the attributes of improved accuracy, trustworthiness (in terms of correctness and stability of the explanation) and energy-efficiency (in terms of wall-clock-time and resource usage).","AI","University of Exeter"

The study of 'AI ethics' has emerged to confront these challenges, and connects perspectives from philosophy, computer science, law, and economics. Less represented in these interdisciplinary efforts is the perspective of cognitive science. We propose a framework – computational ethics – that specifies how the ethical challenges of AI can be partially addressed by incorporating the study of human moral decision-making. The driver of this framework is a computational version of reflective equilibrium (RE), an approach that seeks coherence between considered judgments and governing principles. The framework has two goals: (i) to inform the engineering of ethical AI systems, and (ii) to characterize human moral judgment and decision-making in computational terms. Working jointly towards these two goals will create the opportunity to integrate diverse research questions, bring together multiple academic communities, uncover new interdisciplinary research topics, and shed light on centuries-old philosophical questions.","AI","University of Exeter"
"A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma: How semantic black boxes and opaque artificial intelligence confuse medical decision-making ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/132282","Pierce, R; Sterckx, S; Van Biesen, W","August 2021","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare comes with opportunities but also numerous challenges. A specific challenge that remains underexplored is the lack of clear and distinct definitions of the concepts used in and/or produced by these algorithms, and how their real world meaning is translated into machine language and vice versa, how their output is understood by the end user. This ""semantic"" black box adds to the ""mathematical"" black box present in many AI systems in which the underlying ""reasoning"" process is often opaque. In this way, whereas it is often claimed that the use of AI in medical applications will deliver ""objective"" information, the true relevance or meaning to the end-user is frequently obscured. This is highly problematic as AI devices are used not only for diagnostic and decision support by healthcare professionals, but also can be used to deliver information to patients, for example to create visual aids for use in shared decision-making. This paper provides an examination of the range and extent of this problem and its implications, on the basis of cases from the field of intensive care nephrology. We explore how the problematic terminology used in human communication about the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of concepts of intensive care nephrology becomes a much more complicated affair when deployed in the form of algorithmic automation, with implications extending throughout clinical care, affecting norms and practices long considered fundamental to good clinical care.","AI","University of Exeter"
"Access to finance for Artificial Intelligence regulation in the financial services industry ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/120686","Lee, J","November 2020","This paper discusses the design of the legal and regulatory framework for using artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services markets to enhance access to finance (financial inclusion). The author argues that the development of AI should continue to adhere to the regulatory objectives of market safety, consumer protection, and market integrity. However, to ensure equality and fairness, access to finance should be made a clear policy choice. In Part I, the paper discusses how AI can lead to systemic risks and market manipulation on trading platforms. For example, by examining the use of algorithms for trading on the capital market, the author outlines the regulatory objectives and the possible methods of regulation for peerto- peer platforms. In Part II, it discusses how the use of AI to provide consumers with investment advice, such as financial advice provided from robo-advisers, can close the investment advisory gap and provide consumers access to finance. The current regime does not provide adequate protection to financial consumers in this regard. In Part III, the paper focusses how AI can be used as a form of RegTech to streamline compliance processes, thereby increasing competition in financial markets and providing a benefit to consumers. However, this use may be in conflict with privacy, data protection, and ethical concerns. The author makes policy recommendations and suggests some directions for governance in the use of AI in financial services to enhance access to finance. The findings of this paper are relevant to research on the future governance of artificial intelligence in financial services, public policy innovation, and urban development.","AI","University of Exeter"

We argue that this has now evolved, and outline the rapidly emerging phenomenon of platform urbanism, which we conceptualise as not only confined to the policy sphere, but as stretching across the policy-governance-corporate nexus, the market, and urban consumption practices and broader culture. We do so by focusing on key themes emerging in contemporary platform-based digital urban development in China: a.) the rapidly developing geography of urban platforms; b.) a swiftly expanding mass of data and its implications for state-private sector power geometries; c.) domestic urban policy and practice mobilities, and consequences for the circulation of digital urban platforms between cities and across national boundaries; d.) implications for a reconfiguration of urban citizenship; e.) new configurations of urban materialities in the digital platform era.

"A novel approach to estimate the distribution, density and at-sea risks of a centrally-placed mobile marine vertebrate ","https://ore.exeter.ac.uk//repository/handle/10871/32052","Pikesley, SK; Agamboue, PD; Bayet, JP; et al.","March 2018","Formulating management strategies for mobile marine species is challenging, as knowledge is required of distribution, density, and overlap with putative threats. As a step towards assimilating knowledge, ecological niche models may identify likely suitable habitats for species, but lack the ability to enumerate species densities. Traditionally, this has been catered for by sightings-based distance sampling methods that may have practical and logistical limitations. Here we describe a novel method to estimate at-sea distribution and densities of a marine vertebrate, using historic aerial surveys of Gabonese leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting beaches and satellite telemetry data of females at sea. We contextualise modelled patterns of distribution with putative threat layers of boat traffic, including fishing vessels and large ship movements, using Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. We identify key at-sea areas in which protection for inter-nesting leatherback turtles could be considered within the coastal zone of Gabonese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Our approach offers a holistic technique that merges multiple datasets and methodologies to build a deeper and insightful knowledge base with which to manage known activities at sea. As such, the methodologies presented in this study could be applied to other species of sea turtles for cumulative assessments; and with adaptation, may have utility in defining critical habitats for other central-place foragers such as pinnipeds, or sea bird species. Although our analysis focuses on a single species, we suggest that putative threats identified within this study (fisheries, seismic activity, general shipping) likely apply to other mobile marine vertebrates of conservation concern within Gabonese and central African coastal waters, such as olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea), humpback dolphins (Sousa teuszii) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae).","AI","University of Exeter"
