What counts as a ‘stake’? Who has a ‘stake’?In this report, we present an analysis of 195 UK tech policy documents, assessed for the usage of the term stakeholder and citational practices. We also present results of a workshop with government, academia and civil society discussing policy practices, and provide recommendations for more representative processes for tech policy.","Tech","Solent University"
"Viral marketing and the new competitive advantage","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/viral-marketing-and-the-new-competitive-advantage","Ren, Q.; Tsang, D.","1 Dec 2015","The role played by viral marketing has received considerable academic and digital media attention recently. Key issues in viral marketing have been examined through the lens of the mode of marketing message transmission, including self-replicating on the basis of quality difference, individuals’ emotional needs, as well as how users are connected across various social networks. This paper presents a review and analysis of viral marketing studies from 2001 to the present day. It investigates how viral marketing facilitate the diffusion of social media products and the relationship between marketers and these product users by taking a look at the implementation of viral marketing in two European online game firms Jagex Games Studio and Rovio Entertainment. The results from this review and analysis indicate that viral marketing plays an important role in accelerating the interaction between marketers and users (as well as the user groups) in the field of digital media and high tech consumption. Therefore, it is evident that firms should understand the social contagion process and target well-connected users purposefully in order to create its competitive advantage.","Tech","Solent University"
"Safety first: The risk of over-reliance on technology in navigation","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/safety-first-the-risk-of-over-reliance-on-technology-in-navigatio","Wu, J.; Thorne-Large, J.; Zhang, P.","20 Apr 2021","Modern navigation heavily relies on technology. A modern ship's bridge is a high-tech centre with various equipment, such as Radar/ARPA, Automatic Identification System (AIS), Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite communications, and so on. The ability to operate various maritime technologies is among the most important part of navigation officers’ knowhow. However, as any technology can be an error, there will be failure happen on maritime technologies, such as navigational sensors and computer-based bridge systems. As an unsafe behaviour, over-reliance on technologies in watch keeping may have disastrous consequences. This article analysed the relationship between safe navigation of a ship and an increasing reliance placed on technology by master and officers. It identified at which stage a reliance on technology becomes an over-reliance, and the major causes of this, such as insufficient training and fatigue. Finally, it examines the consequences of an over-reliance on technology and makes some proposals on how these consequences can be prevented.","Tech","Solent University"

H.; Wenlong, T.; Ananthakrishnan, P.","1 Nov 2017","Analytical algorithms developed and optimized for quantifying the wake behind in-stream hydrokinetic turbines are presented. These algorithms are based on wake expressions originally developed for wind turbines. Unlike previous related studies, the optimization of empirical coefficients contained in these algorithms is conducted using centerline velocity data from multiple published experimental studies of the wake velocities behind in-stream hydrokinetic turbine models or porous disks and not using computational fluid dynamics. Empirical coefficients are first individually optimized based on each set of experimental data, and then empirically based coefficient expressions are created using all of the data sets collectively, such that they are functions of ambient turbulence intensity. This expands the applicability of the created algorithms to cover the expected range of operating conditions for in-stream hydrokinetic turbines. Wind turbine wake model expressions are also modified to characterize the dependence of wake velocities on radial location from the centerline of in-stream hydrokinetic turbines. Thus, expressions with empirically optimized coefficients for calculating wake velocities behind in-stream hydrokinetic turbines are described in terms of both centerline and radial positions. Wake predictions made using the Larsen model for radial dependence are shown to diverge from experimental measurements near the wake radius defined by the Jensen model, suggesting that this is a good indication of the cutoff point beyond which numerical estimations no longer apply. Results suggest that using a combined Larsen/Ainslie approach or combined Jensen/Ainslie approach for characterizing wake have similar mean errors to using only a Larsen approach.","Tech","Solent University"
"Supervision during resistance training: a comparison of trainer and trainee perceptions","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/supervision-during-resistance-training-a-comparison-of-trainer-an","Fisher, J.; Androulakis-Korakakis, P.; Giessing, J.; Helms, E.; Schoenfeld, B.; Smith, D.; Winett, R.","1 Dec 2023","Background: Resistance training has well-documented health benefits; however, participation and adherence remain overwhelmingly low. Supervision has been evidenced to improve adherence, and produce favourable adaptations compared to unsupervised resistance training. A recent exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis on supervision during resistance training noted a lack of clarity as to the purpose/intent of the supervisor within the body of literature.Methods: An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted in English and distributed primarily across social media platforms and through the authors’ personal and professional networks. The aim of the survey was to compare the perceptions of supervision between trainers and trainees. Secondary outcomes included exploratory analyses of the impact of training experience, sex of participant, and comparison based on supervision type.Results: 468 participants completed all elements of the survey (68% male, 32% female). Of which 236 were personal trainers/strength coaches, and 232 were trainees. In brief, descriptive data from the survey suggest that trainers perceived supervision as more important than trainees for the characteristics and variables measured. Females perceived supervision in resistance training as more important than males. Trainees who engage in supervised resistance training reported supervision to be more important compared to those training alone or with a training partner. Technical coaching was reported to be the most important characteristic of supervision. Finally, trainers and trainees engaging in supervised strength training reported lower injury rates compared to those strength training unsupervised or with a training partner. Qualitative data are presented regarding perceptions of how and why supervision should differ based on sex, age, and experience, as well as reporting injury experiences.Conclusion: Our data suggest that the perceived benefits of supervision vary based on population. We posit that the present data have implications for both trainers and trainees, which might serve to strengthen a relationship by aligning roles and realising goals in supervised resistance training. Further, this data might provide insight and prompt future research as to how to engage more people into resistance training.","Tech","Solent University"
"Digital Society: Regulating privacy and content online","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/digital-society-regulating-privacy-and-content-online","Benjamin, G.","Sept 2020","Society increasingly relies on digital platforms. But regulation of how we interact with social media, search engines or other online platforms has so far been unsuccessful in preventing harms, ensuring rights are upheld or empowering citizens to engage in digital society. Current laws tend to separate issues out into privacy and online content. This has the advantage of giving clear remits to regulators and focusing energy, resources and expertise on specic issues. But it also holds regulators and policy-makers back when it comes to tackling larger systemic issues. This report argues for broader regulation that brings together the ways data about individuals goes out (privacy or data protection) and how the information they receive comes in (recommendations for online content, particularly when harmful and/or political). This currently spans multiple government departments and regulators in the UK, creating overlaps in some areas but leaving gaping holes in others. At a time when we are relying more and more on large platforms with huge amounts of power, it is essential to empower citizens, communities, smaller organisations, and government, to tip the balance away from a few big tech executives. Only by taking a more comprehensive and cohesive approach can regulation promote rights, justice and equity for a more positive digital society.","Tech","Solent University"
"The effects of adding high-intensity of effort resistance training to routine care in persons with type II diabetes: an exploratory randomized parallel-group time-series study","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effects-of-adding-high-intensity-of-effort-resistance-trainin","Giessing, J.; Eichmann, B.; Kemmler, W.; Westcott, W. L.; Winett, R.; Busuttil, K.; Steele, J.; Fisher, J. P.","15 Dec 2021","Aims This study considered the effects of supervised, low volume, high intensity of effort resistance training compared to continued routine care in persons with type II diabetes. Methods We utilized a randomized parallel-group time-series design. All participants completed baseline testing (T0) and then participated in an educational training intervention regarding the management of their diabetes and were followed up for six months, during which they received routine care before being retested (T1). Participants were then randomly allocated to either continue with routine care (CON) or receive the high intensity of effort resistance training intervention (HIT). Participants from both groups were retested again after six months (T2). All participants were followed up for a further 12 months before being finally tested (T3). Data were available from 57 participants who completed the whole duration of the study (HIT, n = 29; CON, n = 28) for measures of anthropometry (body mass, waist circumference, and BMI), body composition (body fat mass, body fat percentage, lean mass, and visceral fat mass), total body water, phase angle, HbA1c, fasted blood glucose, and subjective wellbeing (WHO-5). Results During the initial 6-months of routine care significant improvements were noted for waist circumference, body fat mass, lean mass, body fat percentage, lean mass percentage, visceral fat mass, HbA1c, fasted blood glucose, and subjective wellbeing. During the successive 6-months (intervention) and 18-months (follow-up), data suggest that many of these positive changes during the initial 6-months were negated or reversed for CON. In contrast, participants engaging in HIT continued to show positive changes for waist circumference, body fat mass, lean mass, body fat percentage, lean mass percentage, and visceral fat. For blood markers and wellbeing, HbA1c continued to decrease, fasted blood glucose decreased, and subjective wellbeing continued to increase. These positive responses were still evidenced and significantly different compared to CON after the 12-month follow-up. ConclusionThe results of this exploratory pragmatic trial suggest that the addition of high intensity of effort RT alongside routine care can have a positive impact on a range of outcomes in type 2 diabetics having undergone prior routine care.","Tech","Solent University"

However, to date, no comprehensive quantitative review exists to support or refute this claim. We address this through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of VSB on heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we focus on HRV parameters indexing PNS activity regulating cardiac functioning, referred to as vagally-mediated (vm)HRV: 1) during the breathing session (i.e., DURING), 2) immediately after one training session (i.e., IM-AFTER1), as well as 3) after a multi-session intervention (i.e., AFTER-INT). From the 1842 selected abstracts, 223 studies were suitable for inclusion (172 DURING, 16 IM-AFTER1, and 49 AFTER-INT). Results indicate increases in vmHRV with VSB, DURING, IM-AFTER1, and AFTER-INT. Given the involvement of the PNS in a large range of health-related outcomes and conditions, VSB exercises could be advised as a low-tech and low-cost technique to use in prevention and adjunct treatment purposes, with few adverse effects expected.","Tech","Solent University"
"Playing at control: writing surveillance in/for gamified society","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/playing-at-control-writing-surveillance-infor-gamified-society","Benjamin, G.","10 Dec 2019","Gamification has entrenched constant monitoring throughout society. From education to work to shopping, our activities are tracked, our progress is monitored and rewards are meted out. But this enforced acceptance of constant surveillance constructs a social narrative in which privacy ceases to exist, and the technological tools at work can easily be shifted from reward to control. This is furthered through the shift from a Bentham/Foucault model of power and the threat of surveillance to the actualisation of complete protocological surveillance enabled by cloud computing, data centres and machine learning. It is no longer the case that anything we do might be surveilled; we can be fairly certain that everything we do probably is being monitored, judged and recorded. How can we negotiate these changing narratives? Of what fictions do we convince ourselves when we play the ‘game’ called digital society? This article uses the work of Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross, Dave Eggers and Ernest Cline to assess how fictionality can act as thought experiments for the social conditions of surveillance technologies. Through stories such as Halting State and Walkaway, we explore the collisions between the control-based society of tech companies and the disciplinary structures of traditional states - the points of tension between illusions of freedom, guided game paths and the exercise of power over users’ data and behaviours. The article argues for expanding our perspectives on the reach of game analysis to the broader connected networks of cultural and political systems, to assess ways of responding to the idea that we are being played with, turned into characters in the gamified narratives of control-based surveillance societies.","Tech","Solent University"

A significant part of this development is the mobile web, which allows people to access location-based information on their smartphones, real-time, as they traverse their environment. For de Souza e Silva (2006) the overlaying of space with such information produces what she refers to as ?hybrid space?. This hybrid space means the city is increasingly a fusion of both the digital and the physical. The various potentials of this fusion are presently being realized through smartphones and locative applications. More recently locative media, such as location-based social networks (LBSNs), have replaced text-message-based social networks, such as Dodgeball. A prime example of this is Foursquare, an LBSN that combines elements of social networking alongside components of pervasive play. Users can share their physical location with friends by ?checking-in?, just as check-ins and combinations of check-ins are awarded points, badges and mayorships. The visualization of social connections through this LBSN, as well as the gamification of space and place, has the potential then to impact how people coordinate social interactions and approach the city. Based on an original qualitative study involving interviews with a number of Foursquare users, and while drawing on early understandings of play (Caillois, 2001; Huizinga, 1992) alongside Simmel?s (1950) work on the metropolis, this paper explores Foursquare and its impact on space, place and social connections in two ways. Firstly it examines the various ways in which this LBSN is used to arrange social interactions, paying close attention to the new social opportunities this is enabling. Secondly it investigates the effect Foursquare and the reframing of play is having on spatial relationships and the mobility choices of users.","Tech","Solent University"

This paper therefore presents a hydrodynamic comparison of three contemporary options, namely a Dynamic Stability System, a Dali-Moustache and a Chistera foil, that have been towing tank tested on a 1:10 scale model of a 50 ft racer-cruiser hull. The analysis presented focuses on the resistance, side force, heave and trim, as well as the induced drag factor and effective draft of each design, eventually resulting in a conclusion on the most suitable configuration for leisure craft applications, and providing experimental data relative to hydrofoils. At this stage, the interest is purely hydrodynamic, and does not yet account for the additional righting moment provided by the foils and the impact on sailing performance.","Tech","Solent University"

Cost savings can be realized through reduction in raw   material required, reduced manufacture times and removing the need for expensive tooling. AM can offer both an economical alternative to the existing aluminum alloy vanes. The current designs of available vanes are limited to flat/angled or hemispherical profiles. Much more sophisticated vane profiles are possible by using 3D CAD designs that can be tested by means of manufacturing vanes through AM techniques. The paper will analyze experimental and CFD simulation results of identical vanes made from AM  materials to existing aluminum alloy vanes. New vane designs will also be tested, which will allow for comparisons to theoretical models for simple geometries as well as experimentation to produce more complex designs to reduce weight and increase the performance.  In addition, other significant factors will also be reviewed, such as cost, build-time, finish and fitness for purpose related to AM manufactured vanes.","Tech","Solent University"

However, research in this field has been mainly centred on the efficacy of the simulation tool whereas there is a lack of comparative studies between the associated teaching and learning procedures. To address the gap, this study facilitates an evidence-driven discussion on learning and teaching, as well as their relationship, in simulation-based programming education. Investigation areas include virtual and physical environments of simulation sessions, relevant learning enablers and impediments, and roles of students and faculty members in the process. The study followed qualitative methodology using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Thirty-seven students and four lecturers on a computing course at a British university shared experiences and perceptions on simulation-based programming sessions. The data were analysed thematically and through cross-evaluation. The findings have provided fresh insights on several enabling and challenging aspects of simulation-based programming education. On the one hand, visualisation, consistency of learning procedures, and student engagement emerged as empowering factors. On the other, the negative implications of collaborative tasks, students’ attention diversion while shifting between virtual and physical environments of learning, and lecturers’ over-emphasis on technology in teaching preparation, appeared as challenges. The paper contributes to understanding the advantages and challenges of using simulation in programming education. It suggests essential teaching principles and their application procedures, which add value to the overall computing education at tertiary level. The learning is transferrable among other engineering programmes and academic disciplines that use simulation for educational purposes.","Tech","Solent University"

In critiquing focus on the drone’s apparent ‘autonomy’, it argues that such devices function as part of a socio-technical network. They are relational parts of human-machine interaction that, in our changing geopolitical realities, have a powerful influence on politics, reputation and warfare. Drawing on Žižek’s conception of parallax, the article stresses the importance of culture and perception in forming the role of the drone in widening power asymmetries. It examines how perceptions of autonomy are evoked by drones, to claim that this misperception is a smokescreen that obscures the relational socio-technical realities of the drone. The article therefore argues that a more critical culture of the drone emerges by shifting the focus and perception from autonomy to anonymity. This allows us to engage more fully with the distributed agency and decision-making that define how drones are developed and deployed. Rather than focusing on the drone as a singular, fetishised, technical object, a relational approach to the drone assemblage is proposed that highlights the competing human interests that define and resist drones in global politics and culture.","Tech","Solent University"

One historical, yet enduring, theory of the human subject is René Descartes’s philosophy of the mind distinct from the body – this is termed ‘Cartesian dualism’. Whilst this is a classical, if outmoded, model of conceiving of a philosophy of the subject, it also provides a useful conceptual framework through which to critique, and arrive at, a different concept of how the terms ‘mind’ and ‘body’ might operate. For example, the mind/body binary distinction can be interrogated and deconstructed to accommodate the role of technology as having an ontologically embedded position within the very definition of ‘humanity’. Indeed, ‘anthropogenesis’ – the very becoming of humanity – might instead incorporate the role of technological prosthesis to any mind/body dualism in defining the ‘human subject’. We will propose that this ‘dualism’ should be reconsidered for a fundamentally entangled mind-body-technology ‘trialism’ in the emergence of a distinct human being. However, at the same time, this interconnected relationship is also the object of power and control.","Tech","Solent University"

The design of a contemporary wooden Thames A Rater will be presented, aiming at retaining the spirit of tradition of the class, while incorporating the latest design evolutions, and complying with the current rules and regulations. Techniques such as computational fluid dynamics and parametric optimisation will be employed, leading to a significant increase in performance quantified thanks to a velocity prediction programme, thus demonstrating the applications of modern naval architecture techniques to historical crafts.","Tech","Solent University"

"Technology enhanced teacher-learning in rural Bangladesh: a critical realist inquiry with secondary teachers of English","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/technology-enhanced-teacher-learning-in-rural-bangladesh-a-critic","Jamil, M. G.","2015","In this thesis I explore the feasibility of technology enhanced teacher-learning approaches in rural Bangladesh. The secondary teachers of English are my research focus and, apart from them, the core stakeholders include the head teachers and the local teacher trainers. My research questions cover specific inquiries on the learning culture of these teachers, their attitudes about the application of technology in teacher-learning, and realistic pedagogical and management procedures for operationalising technology enhanced teacher-learning in rural Bangladesh. In my investigation I follow the critical realist and mixed-method research approaches by addressing the psychological, social, educational and technological perspectives of the stakeholders. Based on an extensive literature review on learning, pedagogy and technological interventions in professional development, I propose that the post-constructivist approaches (I use this term to refer to social constructivism and connectivism) are appropriate for the teacher-learning programmes for rural Bangladeshi teachers. The approaches are also compatible to various technological interventions. I initially design a technology enhanced teacher-learning framework emphasising the applications of teachers’ experiences and reflections which, based on my research findings, extends to the applied form by incorporating the management, application of teacher-learning in teaching, and monitoring procedures. For collecting the research data I conduct a questionnaire-based survey and a series of six workshop-led focus group discussion sessions in a rural district of Bangladesh. In the process I emphasise the inclusion of different stakeholders and their higher participation to gain relevant indigenous knowledge representing realistic findings. The collected research data and their analysis provide useful baseline information particularly about the learning culture of the stakeholders and their perceptions about technology enhanced teacher-learning approaches. It also provides practical guidelines on the effective and sustainable approaches of technology enhanced teacher-learning in rural Bangladesh context. I expect that the learning from this research would help design and implement effective technology enhanced teacher-learning schemes for rural Bangladesh and, at the same time, provide guidelines to operationalise similar professional development programmes for the teachers of other subjects of other institutional levels representing different educational contexts.","Tech","Solent University"

Increasingly, most of these systems are starting to be based on the Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs). SOAs enable the automatic creation of business applications from independently developed and deployable Web services. When a SOA component suffers failure it results in sub-par operational performance and ultimately hampers the revenue stream of the organization. There are two approaches to minimize the failure risk in SOA: (a) Fault Intolerance tries to eliminate the faults before it occurs in a system. (b) Fault-Tolerance techniques deal with faults that occur on run time and try averting that faults from turning into system failures. Most of the current fault management techniques focus on the latter. However, in our study we develop a hybrid model. The method proposed in this paper (FT-SOA) predicts the failure based on HSMM and clustering techniques for SOAs and Web services. We focus on failure prediction because it plays a major role in having a highly available system. The objective of the online fault prediction is to predict the occurrence of faults in the system, based on the current information such as: service weight, previous history and reputation. A new prediction method is created to assess the fault likelihood in the near future execution of a specific service in a composite solution. We compare our approach with similar techniques to show the applicability of our approach.","Tech","Solent University"

To fulfill these goals, this article argues the need for a clearer, shared understanding of the social value of protected areas in creating new designations and managing existing ones. Although marine and coastal environments attract many people and are vitally important in terms of realized and potential social value, the majority of the public in the United Kingdom lacks understanding and awareness regarding them. Combined with this, the social value of marine and coastal protected areas (MCPAs) have been largely ignored relative to conservation and economics, with the latter invariably taking precedence in environmental policymaking. Social value reflects the complex, individual responses that people experience in a given place. Many reasons determine why one area is valued above another, and this research investigates the social value of MCPAs from a practitioner?s perspective through a series of interviews. Understanding why we ?socially? value MCPAs will ultimately equip managers with an informed understanding of these spaces, influence management decisions, and, potentially, policymaking. This article defines social value in the context of MCPAs in England and Wales from a practitioner perspective, explores key concepts, and suggests possible improvements in decision-making.","Marine","Solent University"

The emissions of these vessels, in concert with the wider maritime industry are under increasing scrutiny and pressure to achieve reductions. Ambitious policy targeting reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG), NOx and SOx emissions will require significant changes in vessel propulsion and fuel use. This paper examines the environmental impact of various alternative low-emission fuels for a super yacht. The study investigated well-to-wake energy consumption and the environmental impact of alternative low-emission fuels over the complete vessel lifetime. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment was performed on Marine Gas Oil (MGO), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), methanol, biodiesel and hydrogen with various energy production pathways. Results suggested that hydrogen produced using a  wind energy pathway offers the most environmentally sound alternative to MGO; with a 93.95% reduction in GHG emissions and 91.95% acidification potential (AP) emissions. Fossil based alternatives have very limited potential to achieve regulatory reduction targets. Global warming potential (GWP) suggest that LNG fuel can reduce 20% to 25%  CO2 emission in the Tank-to-Wake phase in comparison with MGO. However, considering CH4 emissions, may result in a 5.4% higher GWP. The results highlight the differences in life-cycle emissions as a result of different production pathways. The paper concludes with recommendations for hydrogen from a renewable production.","Marine","Solent University"

Considerable concern relates to their reported xenoestrogenicity and the microbial-based attenuation of environmental PE concentrations is of interest to combat harmful downstream effects. Fungal PE catabolism has received less attention than that by bacteria, and particularly marine fungal species remain largely overlooked in this respect. We have compared the biocatalytic and biosorptive removal rates of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP), chosen as two environmentally prominent PE representatives (exhibiting differing structures and hydrophobicities), by marine- and freshwater fungal strains. Bisphenol A, both an extensively used plastic additive and prominent environmental xenoestrogen, was included as a reference compound due to its previously well-documented fungal degradation. Partial pathways for DBP metabolization by these ecophysiologically diverse ascomycetes were proposed with the help of UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. Species-specific biochemical reaction steps contributing to DBP metabolism were also observed. The involved reactions include initial cytochrome P450-dependent monohydroxylations of DBP with subsequent further oxidation of related metabolites, de-esterification via either hydrolytic cleavage or cytochrome P450-dependent oxidative O-dealkylation, transesterification, and demethylation steps - finally yielding phthalic acid as a central intermediate in all pathways. Beyond previous research into fungal PE metabolism which emphasises hydrolytic de-esterification as the primary catabolic step, a prominent role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-catalysed reactions is established.","Marine","Solent University"

These are often linked with a sense of place, culture, heritage and identity. The assessment of cultural ecosystem services, particularly in the marine environment is an inherently complex and difficult task, because they often involve making value judgments which can be hard to quantify. Methods applied to determining the value of these services are often focused on their financial value. Whilst methodologies have been developed to assess the non-material importance of these services, this paper argues that Q methodology provides a highly appropriate way of examining unmeasurable values by being able to convert qualitative, subjective data into quantitative information. The research presents two data sets derived from Q methodology which examined stakeholder views of the cultural values from two marine protected areas; the Pacific Rim National Park, Vancouver Island, Canada and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Chichester Harbour, UK. The relevance of using Q methodology as a valuation mechanism in this type of study is examined and justified; whilst highlighting the advantages of tackling a subject of values and intangibility, highly qualitative information, with a structured, semi-automated and primarily quantitative methodology. The findings show that the case-study areas hold three predominant ‘factors’ of value for its stake holders. These include the protected areas; as a place of care for each other and oneself through the natural world; a place of spirituality; and as a place of freedom and refuge. The paper strongly argues for the use of Q methodology in such a study, which ultimately helps to bring about a depth of information that arguably traditional methods are incapable of in the same capacity.","Marine","Solent University"

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed MPA-OBL, the effectiveness of conjunction of OBL with the original MPA and the other counterparts are calculated and compared with LSHADE with semi-parameter adaptation hybrid with CMA-ES (LSHADE_SPACMA-OBL), Restart covariance matrix adaptation ES (CMA_ES-OBL), Differential evolution (DE-OBL), Harris hawk optimization (HHO-OBL), Sine cosine algorithm (SCA-OBL), Salp swarm algorithm (SSA-OBL), and the original MPA.

In this context, the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (MLC 2006) can be regarded as focusing the concept in a manner that is not found elsewhere (whether in treaties or in case law). The implementation of the Convention will change shipowners' obligations to ensure ship safety and constitute an essential element of the standard of seaworthiness. Moreover, it is submitted that the MLC 2006 shifts the centre of emphasis in a manner that is both focused and necessary.

A significant contributor to economic development, emissions from vessels using these waterways are contributing to climate change, pollution, and other issues. Ambitious policies to reduce greenhouse gas, SOx, and NOx emissions, require sweeping changes in propulsion and fuel technology. Hydrogen and electricity are recognised as pathways for vessel decarbonisation; however, mismanagement of production may increase overall lifecycle emissions. This study identifies appropriate alternative fuel technologies for inland vessels to mitigate climate change and deliver emission reduction over the fuel lifecycle.

This volume of waste produces pressures on the environment, particularly with respect to ship-generated waste disposal at home ports and ports of call. Southampton, home port for both Cunard and P&O, and a port of call for Royal Caribbean Cruises, is the focus of this study. This paper investigates current waste management and disposal options for cruise ship generated waste and the associated impacts of this waste for ports. It is concluded that all cruise vessels should vigorously pursue a waste reduction strategy and for ports to provide adequate recycling, reduction and re-use facilities for cruise ship generated waste, optimising use of local facilities whenever possible.","Marine","Solent University"
"Comparison of perceived fatigue levels of seafarers and management approaches in fatigue mitigation: case studies from two Chinese and two European shipping companies","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/comparison-of-perceived-fatigue-levels-of-seafarers-and-managemen","Zhao, Z.; Wadsworth, E.; Jepsen, J.; van Leeuwen, W.","26 Feb 2020","There is a substantial literature on fatigue among seafarers, but very little comparison of the experiences and perceptions of seafarers working for different companies and, in particular, those working for companies based in developed and developing countries. Using data from 880 questionnaires to seafarers and 60 interviews conducted with seafarers and managers, from two Chinese and two European shipping companies, this study takes a first step to addressing this gap. It reveals perceptions of higher fatigue, and poorer working and employment conditions, among seafarers working for Chinese as compared with European shipping companies. This difference was related to a relative lack of commitment from the Chinese shipping companies' managers to fatigue mitigation and a participatory approach. Overall, the findings suggest that although the merchant shipping industry has internationally regulated working and on-board living conditions, management practices and compliance standards within companies in different countries vary. International regulatory arrangements, therefore, do not result in a level playing field – which has potentially serious consequences both for seafarers' safety, health and wellbeing, and for the safety of the world's fleets and marine environments. The findings also indicate that, despite differences in degree, fatigue continues to be a significant problem across the shipping industry. Finally, ways are suggested in which stakeholders could contribute to improving fatigue mitigation and management.","Marine","Solent University"

We find that NSR transit numbers have generally been low (μ=34 transits per year), varying between 71 transits per year (in 2013), 18 transits (in 2015, 2016), and 27 transits each in 2017 and 2018. On an aggregate basis, tankers and dry cargo ships have been the largest users of the NSR (123 and 122 transits respectively, accounting for 82% of all transits), followed by ice breakers, OSVs and SAR vessels (12% or 35 transits). Only 15 transits (5%) were by passenger, cruise and research ships followed by coastguard and fishing vessel (1%). Factors preventing its wider adoption include the comparatively lesser, but still existent presence of sea ice thus constituting a hazard to navigation, few cargo ports along the NSR, higher insurance premiums, inadequate coverage of charts, inadequate SAR facilities, the need for ice breaker assistance and resultant higher transit costs. Due to the presence of ice, NSR was open for navigation for < 155 days each year (132 days in 2018). Due to these pertinacious obstacles to safe navigation, the thinning of arctic ice has not resulted in waters sufficiently free of ice to enable safe commercially viable passage of commercial conventional cargo ships.","Marine","Solent University"

Many are operated by global companies with strong corporate rhetoric espousing zero tolerance of injury and ill-health. Yet operational practices often contribute to the intensification of work and outsourcing of labour; conditions associated with poor safety and health. Serious and fatal injuries and ill-health continue to occur in these terminals. With reference to the findings of a study of occupational safety and health (OSH) arrangements in terminals operated by four of the largest operators, key contextual determinants in the terminals’ labour relations and regulatory environments that influence practice and outcomes are identified. The influences are compared in different national settings and, the paper finds, like multinational companies generally, global operators are obliged to adapt and reflect local contexts. In relation to OSH best practice, a critical influence is the way that local context acts to constrain and challenge business logics and interests. This acts to make 'best practice' more likely where companies are constrained in this way, regardless of the claims of their corporate rhetoric.","Marine","Solent University"

Using a numerical simulation of a representative ocean current turbine it is shown that harmonic blade oscillations with amplitudes of 1.5° can be used to displace an ocean current turbine laterally by a distance equal to one rotor diameter, when the mooring cable length is approximately 30 times the diameter of the rotor blade. For current flow directions that would result in a downstream turbine operating in the wake of an upstream system at a distance of 10 diameters, this technique could be used to reduce the power loss of the downstream system from about 50% (caused by the reduced flow speed available in the turbine wake) to the 1.2% power loss associated with the suggested control approach.","Marine","Solent University"
"What Chance Adaptive Coastal Management For Climate Change?  A Legal Dysfunction in Vertical Governance","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/what-chance-adaptive-coastal-management-for-climate-change-a-lega","Gallagher, A.; Park, P.; Galley, M.","2010","Mitigation has been the dominant approach to dealing with climate change to date. Perceived limitations of this approach, however, led Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) to agree in Bali, 2007 that the alternative approach of adaptation should play a significantly greater role in the future global response, and this is now embedded as one of the post 2012 pillars. There is evidence of adaptation already taking place but this is currently piecemeal in manner. A more strategic approach is therefore needed to ensure that timely and effective adaptation measures are taken, ensuring coherence across different sectors and levels of governance. To this end the European Union produced a White Paper in April 2009, aimed at reducing vulnerability. Similarly, on a national basis many countries are consulting on a range of adaptive instruments, with the UK being no exception and issuing a consultation document on the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in October 2009. A major problem, however, is the disconnect between the vertical structure of legal instruments from international conventions, through European Community law, state legislation, and what happens within the coastal communities through local government and agencies. Adaptive management shows up in coastal management plans, regional development plans, and agency guidance documents; yet it appears almost nowhere within codified statutory and regulatory text. The research presented in this article is geographically concerned with exploring the capacity of coastal areas to adapt to change and what legal impediments might hinder such responses. In order to further the research, a case study approach is used with a particular focus on Christchurch Bay, UK, the conclusions from which may be transferred horizontally to other vulnerable areas of the UK coast and beyond.","Marine","Solent University"

H.; Wenlong, T.; Ananthakrishnan, P.","1 Nov 2017","Analytical algorithms developed and optimized for quantifying the wake behind in-stream hydrokinetic turbines are presented. These algorithms are based on wake expressions originally developed for wind turbines. Unlike previous related studies, the optimization of empirical coefficients contained in these algorithms is conducted using centerline velocity data from multiple published experimental studies of the wake velocities behind in-stream hydrokinetic turbine models or porous disks and not using computational fluid dynamics. Empirical coefficients are first individually optimized based on each set of experimental data, and then empirically based coefficient expressions are created using all of the data sets collectively, such that they are functions of ambient turbulence intensity. This expands the applicability of the created algorithms to cover the expected range of operating conditions for in-stream hydrokinetic turbines. Wind turbine wake model expressions are also modified to characterize the dependence of wake velocities on radial location from the centerline of in-stream hydrokinetic turbines. Thus, expressions with empirically optimized coefficients for calculating wake velocities behind in-stream hydrokinetic turbines are described in terms of both centerline and radial positions. Wake predictions made using the Larsen model for radial dependence are shown to diverge from experimental measurements near the wake radius defined by the Jensen model, suggesting that this is a good indication of the cutoff point beyond which numerical estimations no longer apply. Results suggest that using a combined Larsen/Ainslie approach or combined Jensen/Ainslie approach for characterizing wake have similar mean errors to using only a Larsen approach.","Marine","Solent University"

None of these, however, could produce a definitive conclusion. This is because both the use of safety outcome as well as the use of perception have inherent problems and are not reliable. This paper takes a different approach. It draws on wider research on management of workplace health and safety to ascertain whether or not employment and social conditions that support effective implementation of self-regulation are present in the maritime context. The findings reveal a considerable disparity between managers’ and seafarers’ understanding of the use of the Code resulting in a wide gap between its intended purpose and practice. The analysis shows that the critical factor is the lack of seafarers’ participation in management of workplace health and safety. The underlying causal factors for such lack of participation were located in seafarers’ poor employment condition and low-trust relationship with their managers.","Marine","Solent University"

It was found that coastal defence is the key concern of stakeholders, that complex legislation is the main barrier to effective management of the Solent, that most drivers of change relate to national and European policy, and that sea level rise is the key future management challenge for the Solent. In this context, the evidence suggested that the Solent Forum should retain a role that facilitates co-ordinated management and brokers stakeholder involvement in coastal decision-making.

A survey of boat owners determined corrosion rates and estimated zinc loading at between 6.95 and 7.11 t/year. The research confirms the variable anode corrosion within the Hamble and highlighted a lack of awareness of anode technology among boat owners.

The development and deployment of a Port Sustainability Management System for smaller ports in an environmentally sensitive but economically peripheral UK area is discussed. In-depth collaboration with Harbour Masters to identify sustainability management practice revealed few applications of the theoretical elements of triple bottom line accounting. Rather, semi-structured interviews unearthed the essential elements of port management and facilitated mapping of the forces which underpin port sustainability practices. A constructivist grounded theory approach identified emerging concepts, common patterns and sustainability themes, which were synthesised into a Sustainability Management System based on 11 indicators of knowledge criteria and a self-scoring mechanism. Adopters reported a more proactive stance towards sustainability and safeguarding of local communities, improved understanding, and more effective discourse with stakeholders. Benefits spanned port improvements; awareness of progress, performance, strengths and weaknesses; enhanced communication and reporting; and improved thought processes. Almost all reacted positively and identified multiple benefits, equating to two new jobs in each port.","Marine","Solent University"

Project HORIZON is a highly significant European funded research project that seeks to investigate the problem of seafarer reliability, and to deliver measures that will help alleviate the safety hazards caused by fatigue. For this purpose, a realistic scenario was developed, in which watch keeper cognitive performance and fatigue levels were measured, using the bridge, engine and cargo operations simulator facilities at Warsash, linked together to provide a 7 day continuous voyage. Ten simulations runs have been performed with 40 certificated seafarers of varying experience. Analysis of the results shows a significant impact of the 6 on / 6 off watch pattern on the fatigue and performance of seafarers. It is hoped these results will lead to better fatigue management systems being developed, in order to improve the safety and reliability of ship operations and the welfare of seafarers.

In July 2011, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee of the International Maritime organisation (IMO), imposed a reduction of pollutants, such as NOx and SOx, by 90% before 2025, and a complete end to CO2 emission by 2050. Consequently, several alternative fuel options have been proposed and investigated in the literature, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and hybrid, with however some issues regarding their long term implementation. On the other hand, a combination of full electric and fuel cells have not yet been fully considered as a means of propulsion in the marine industry. Some promising examples of fuel cell applications have highlighted up to 15% savings on a hybrid system onboard offshore supply vessels. Moreover, fuel cells have been applied to river ferries. Nevertheless, the technology has yet to be adapted to the leisure craft market as a main source of propulsion, building on extensive research of the automotive industry, with wide scale applications for public transport. The proposed system will be applied to the design of a cruising catamaran, but its application will be generalised to both new constructions as well as retrofitting installation on existing vessels. Utilising solar energy to perform hydrolyses, the vessel will be able to run on hydrogen fuel autonomously with no more restriction in range. Among the numerous advantages of this system are the absence of fuel consumption, the unlimited range capabilities, and absence of noise and vibrations for enhanced comfort. Furthermore, the considerable space savings compared to a tradition propulsion system will allow for more accommodation volume than similar vessels of the same size, with a tremendous step forward towards a more sustainable marine industry.","Marine","Solent University"

L.","28 Nov 2023","Introduction: Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKIs) are common during military and other occupational physical training programmes, and employers have a duty of care to mitigate this injury risk. MSKIs account for a high number of working days lost during initial military training, contribute to training attrition and impact training costs. Poorer movement quality may be associated with increased MSKI risk. Methods: The present study evaluated the relationship between the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) Score, as a measure of movement quality, and injury risk in Royal Navy (RN) recruits. A cohort of 957 recruits was assessed using the FMS prior to the 10-week phase I training programme. Injury occurrence, time, type and severity were recorded prospectively during the training period. Results: Total FMS Score was associated with injury risk (p≤0.001), where recruits scoring ≥13 were 2.6 times more likely to sustain an injury during training. However, FMS Score accounted for only 10% of the variance in injury risk (R2=0.1). Sex was the only additional variable to significantly affect the regression model. Mean FMS Scores for men (14.6±2.3) and women (14.4±2.4) were similar, but injury occurrence in women was 1.7 times greater than in men. Examining the influence of individual FMS movement tests on injury prediction did not improve the model, where those movements that significantly contributed to injury prediction only accounted for a small amount of the variance (R2=0.01). Conclusion: There was a weak relationship between FMS and injury risk in RN recruits.

The remoteness, risk and complexity in the workplace itself necessitates a range of training facilities to emulate and simulate the workplace for the trainee or student. Different institutions internationally have developed their facilities for courses offered and compliance with the national training requirements, international training requirements and specialist local industry requirements. This has resulted in a diverse approach to the development of facilities across different institutions. This document outlines the facilities at each of the partners within the project and identifies common trends and baselines by means of categorising facilities and recording the distribution of facilities within categories. This supports the overall project aims of identifying the curriculum, pedagogical approaches and facilities required to support different disciplines in the industry, draw conclusions and make recommendations for development for the partners. Based on both the commonality of facilities between partners and requirements set out in international legislation, a series of recommendations for required facilities are therefore given. The enhancement of facilities during the project is discussed, with a narrative explaining the change in the context of facilities use due to the global Covid-19 Pandemic.","Navy","Solent University"

During one of those voyages, I captured a photo of Arrys, a 67-year-old officer, who had spent most of his life at sea. Despite several attempts of shifting ashore, Arrys was pushed back to sea due to different circumstances. Seafaring is considered a difficult line of work, with long hours and constant isolation from life ashore. For these and other reasons, many seafarers expressed their intentions to leave seafaring after a short time to seek employment elsewhere. In the context of my research, despite the intention of many seafarers to leave the sea and continue their employment ashore, they are hindered from doing so for various reasons, including difficulties to adjust to life ashore. As a result, even if seafaring is initially intended to be a short-term job, for many, it is liable to become a lifelong occupation.","Navy","Solent University"

Four currently serving, male Royal Marines ranging from 40-42 years participated in semi-structured one-to-one interviews that explored perceptions of social support. Using thematic analysis, comradeship was found to be important in terms of maintaining support networks. However, this resource was used to avoid the reconciliation of traumatic memories. Social support from family members was sought when veterans were reassured that relatives would understand their experiences, and could support reconciliation. The importance of positive societal reaction was also emphasized. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential for early life reconciliation of traumatic war memories through the creation of a meaningful personal narrative.","Navy","Solent University"

Much of the literature on themental and physical health battles faced bymen and women who leave the Armed Forces is dominated by research in the United States (US) (1), and is particularly focused on exposure to deployment, combat conditions, and effects on mental health. Research in the United Kingdom (UK) tends to focus on depression or alcohol misuse and the impact these issues have on currently serving personnel. This study aimed to present UK veterans’ first-hand experiences related to military service,access to and use of mental healthcare and interventions, and the impact of transition on the military family. Semi-structured interviews explored experiences of 30 participants (27 male, 3 female). Participants ranged in age from 26 to 92 years (M = 53.33), and across multiple war cohorts (from WWII to Iraq and Afghanistan). Data were analyzed using Thematic Analysis and Narrative Analysis. Findings show meaning-making from experiences of transition across veteran cohorts. Main themes were reasons for leaving Armed Forces, life outside the military, and mental health concerns after service. Subordinate themes additionally focused on evaluation of identity and mental healthservice provision. Future clinical research should include the experiences of UK serving personnel and the effects of pre-and post-military adversity, alongside the impact of deployment experiences.

With reference to works by the artist Henry Tonks and photographs of surgical procedure, the paper highlights the fundamental principles upon which medical science discourse has traditionally sought to treat the subject: through the Cartesian mind–body duality, treating the ‘wounds’ of the mind and the body as separate entities. More specifically, it examines the new crisis in embodied being that occurred as a result of the First World War. The state’s treatment of the traumatized soldier attempted to recoup him through, what came to be known as the ‘contact barrier’. The nature of the wound, and the restoration of mental and bodily ‘contact barriers’, is in constant negotiation as the technologies of the state attempt to re-engineer the subject to perform the will of the state. Psychoanalysis, plastic surgery and electrification are interventions that are seen as having radical effects, although fundamentally conservative, in their attempt to recoup the mind–body by restoring the barrier between self and ‘other’. Tonks’ drawings reveal a tension between his objective anatomical education and the subjective trauma of the wound.","Navy","Solent University"

"The Case Against Militarism","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/the-case-against-militarism","Cox, Q.","1 Sept 2011","Having met, worked and socialised with a myriad of Maritime University and Academy staff around the world, many courtesy of my privileged membership of IMLA , it has struck me how the approach to MET varies throughout these many institutions. There appear to be a series of very distinct regimes across the world. Many flag states choose to train their officer trainees under degree programmes whilst others choose a less academic process. Whether on a degree programme or not, there are also many regimes whom choose a militaristic approach to the training of officers. This militaristic approach is not limited to domestic discipline enforcement; it stretches into the classroom. One might question the function of a military style instructional teaching programme, where the entire premise of producing a watch keeping officer, is to encourage independent problem solving skills. The problem is that instructional teaching methods do little to instil the required capabilities into a trainee. In the early stages of their training new entrants often have their personality crushed in order for it to be re-built under an enforced discipline regime. They are deliberately overloaded with work, both physical and study, on the premise that life on board a merchant ship will be similarly challenging. This is not necessarily the case. The argument offered by this paper is based on the contention that a militaristic approach to training breeds ?followers? not ?leaders?. Trainees learn how to follow ?orders?. One concern is that even as a senior officer they will expect Captains to be the only decision maker on board. During a period when the global shipping industry is suffering from an alarming lack of recruits, this is especially concerning.","Navy","Solent University"
"The China Clippers","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/the-china-clippers","Daniels, S.","2015","The idea of ""one belt, one road"" in the UK-China relationship reached its pinnacle of maritime enterprise in the mid-19th Century. The commodity was tea. Captain Arthur Clark summed up what drives the maritime road when he observed that the demand for tea in the mid-19th Century created a breed of shipmaster who could deliver their cargoes to the tea auctions in London as rapidly as possible, in order to fetch the highest price. For very good reasons, the clipper Masters were the finest seafarers in the world, with a vested interest in beating their rivals in the race home to the London tea auctions. A successful Master could earn the enormous sum of £5,000 a year - approximating to £450,000 in 2016 - and so he drove his ship to the limits of her endurance, slashing home through the English Channel, a hundred days out of China. Some Masters only went below to change their clothes or take a bath; others used the settee in the chart room or even a deck-chair as a bed. The tea race of 1866 proved to be the most thrilling of all. From the traders in the City of London to the locals in the humblest village inn, bets were placed and arguments raged over the favoured contenders. Indeed, the crews of the Serica and Fiery Cross bet a month's pay against each other that they would be first home to London. It proved to be one of the most thrilling events in maritime history. As the Smithsonian has put it: The Tea Race of 1866 caused an enormous stir in the sporting and nautical circles of Britain. Ariel and Taeping had left Foochow together and arrived home on the other side of the globe still together, Ariel's winning time being seven thousandths of one per cent faster than her rival's. The Tea Race was never so close again in its 30-year history. By a remarkable coincidence, delegates from Southampton Solent University were participating in the International Conference on Maritime Policy, Technology and Education, Shanghai, on the 150th anniversary, to the very day, when the leading contenders left China; so it was fitting that the anniversary should be commemorated with this monograph.","Navy","Solent University"

R. G.; Pignone, F.","13 Apr 2018","The contemporary concerns inherent to sustainability have become predominant in a number of industries, including the marine one. In July 2011, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee of the International Maritime organisation (IMO), imposed a reduction of pollutants, such as NOx and SOx, by 90% before 2025, and a complete end to CO2 emission by 2050. Consequently, several alternative fuel options have been proposed and investigated in the literature, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and hybrid, with however some issues regarding their long term implementation. On the other hand, a combination of full electric and fuel cells have not yet been fully considered as a means of propulsion in the marine industry. Some promising examples of fuel cell applications have highlighted up to 15% savings on a hybrid system onboard offshore supply vessels. Moreover, fuel cells have been applied to river ferries. Nevertheless, the technology has yet to be adapted to the leisure craft market as a main source of propulsion, building on extensive research of the automotive industry, with wide scale applications for public transport. The proposed system will be applied to the design of a cruising catamaran, but its application will be generalised to both new constructions as well as retrofitting installation on existing vessels. Utilising solar energy to perform hydrolyses, the vessel will be able to run on hydrogen fuel autonomously with no more restriction in range. Among the numerous advantages of this system are the absence of fuel consumption, the unlimited range capabilities, and absence of noise and vibrations for enhanced comfort. Furthermore, the considerable space savings compared to a tradition propulsion system will allow for more accommodation volume than similar vessels of the same size, with a tremendous step forward towards a more sustainable marine industry.","Navy","Solent University"

This paper draws on the findings of a study that considered both the experiences of women seafarers working in the UK shipping industry and the views of key industry stakeholder representatives, and asks what must be done to improve those experiences? Respondents across the industry suggest that all women seafarers will experience some form of harassment during their careers, which has significant implications for their occupational health, safety and wellbeing. These experiences reflect failures of leadership in developing and promoting a safe and inclusive onboard culture. This paper calls for fundamental change within the industry, including improvements in training and leadership to reflect modern seafaring and diversity on board. It also calls for relevant policy and strategic changes to be based on the views of seafarers and their representatives. It concludes that improving the experiences of women on board will improve the occupational health, safety, and wellbeing of all seafarers, regardless of gender or any other characteristic or classification.","Navy","Solent University"

The paper provides an overview of three research initiatives: the first is to gain a better theoretical understanding of the nature of shared situational awareness and mental models in ""real world"" maritime operations. A second initiative is to identify a set of behavioural markers for assessing the non-technical skills of crisis management. The third initiative is to explore the role of organisational factors in safe operation, in recognition of the limitations of operator training as a panacea to prevent the re-occurrence of accidents.","Navy","Solent University"

This article explores their experiences in an industry operating under international legislation designed to ensure and maintain their employment and working conditions. Three hundred and fifty-two British seafarers completed an online questionnaire. The findings revealed two key themes: the erosion of the terms and conditions of those who work at sea, and the differing experiences of those who were precariously employed on single voyage contracts in comparison to those in permanent employment. In contrast with precariously employed individuals, more seafarers with permanent contracts were joining the vessel as normal and fewer were not being paid having been unable to join a ship as scheduled. In a similar vein, fewer permanently employed seafarers were adversely financially impacted during the pandemic. The article concludes that those with the weakest employment relationships have experienced the greatest challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic –– a scenario which was possible as a result of the limited enforcement of the regulatory framework intended to protect those who work at sea.","Navy","Solent University"

Where the industry fails in one or more of these respects it can have a profound impact on communities, the environment and the economy. Given the demands on the industry and the consequences of failure it is important to understand the factors impacting the performance of those employed at sea in order to permit the creation of an optimum working environment where negative outcomes are less likely.The merchant shipping industry in common with others maintains a constant focus on its cost base. As crewing is the largest controllable part of a vessel’s operating budget it often receives a great deal of scrutiny in terms of salaries and associated costs such as travel. This narrow focus on cost, if taken in isolation, risks missing the contribution of crewing strategies to other value-added aspects of vessel performance, however little research has been conducted in this respect.The Effective Crew Research Project, sponsored by the Lloyds Register Foundation and the TK Foundation, was a two-year study which examined the benefits and challenges of implementing stable and fluid crews within the merchant shipping industry. The focus was on vessels types with more than 20 crew including: tankers, car carriers, containers, bulk carriers and chemical carriers, although some additional data was collected. The research incorporated a review of literature and collected data from an industry wide survey and 29 interviews with experienced maritime stakeholders and experts from other industries, including healthcare and aviation.3The research has shown that the fluid nature of crewing within the sea-going area of the industry negatively impacts on crew welfare, crew and vessel safety, and does not encourage employment retention. Stable crewing, however, is shown to develop a greater sense of ownership and responsibility which promotes better safety outcomes including improved vessel maintenance and knowledge of specific equipment on board.Team familiarity generated by stable crewing was also found to promote trust and good working relations, which can increase productivity and provide better mental health outcomes for the crew. Other benefits from stable teams included improved vessel maintenance and reduced maintenance costs as well as shorter handover times and recruitment costs. These outcomes have longer term financial benefits for vessel operations and the shipping company. However, those implementing stable teams, particularly for the top 4 senior officers, should be aware that this can mean fewer promotional opportunities and, over time, an increased risk of complacency. Although there are some clear benefits to stable crewing, the uniqueness of individual shipping companies means that one size does not fit every situation. It is therefore vital that crewing strategies are continuously and consistently evaluated and adjusted where necessary. Changes to a different crewing strategy, or combination of strategies within a fleet, should be considered if evaluation highlights this as the best option for maximising cost efficiency, safety and crew well-being.Regardless of the manning strategy adopted, it is important to recognise the influence that leadership and management can have on on-board culture. Poor leadership, despite the crewing strategy implemented, can have a detrimental effect on crew wellbeing and safety and ultimately on the budget. Recommendations from this project therefore include greater support for the senior officers both from shore side personnel, and on-going leadership training and development.It is paramount for the ethical and sustainable advancement within shipping, that the highest levels of on-board team working are understood and achieved. This in turn will promote efficient, safe and sustainable working practices that support the best outcomes for the crew.","Navy","Solent University"

However, it can also encourage unhelpful ways of coping, such as avoidance, or may be absent altogether. This project borrowed from the growing peer support literature to explore the suitability of peer support services to enhance wellbeing for older veterans, when naturally occurring support is absent or unhelpful.Methodological approach: This was a sequentially staged research programme involving a scoping review of current practice and evidence, and a consultation with veterans. In total, 10 veterans (nine male, 1 female) took part in the consultation (M = 66 years).Findings: Peer support was considered a suitable, particularly in addressing loneliness and social isolation. There was an understandable concern regarding its use with more complex issues such as trauma. An added issue was the implicit assumption that this consultation concerned transition; supporting younger veteran as they move from military to civilian life. This mirrored the focus of current UK policy and affected the focus of the consultation. Issues were also raised around sustainability of services more broadly.Social implications: Peer support is appropriate in supporting older veterans, but must be implemented in a sustainable way. Raising awareness of the needs of older veterans in older adult services is an important implication for service development and delivery.Originality: There is a considerable lack of research concerning older veterans, particularly concerning their formal and informal social support needs.

However, those implementing stable teams, particularly for the top 4 senior officers, should be aware that this can mean fewer promotional opportunities and, over time, an increased risk of complacency. Although there are some clear benefits to stable crewing, the uniqueness of individual shipping companies means that one size does not fit every situation. It is therefore vital that crewing strategies are continuously and consistently evaluated and adjusted where necessary. Changes to a different crewing strategy, or combination of strategies within a fleet, should be considered if evaluation highlights this as the best option for maximising cost efficiency, safety and crew well-being.Regardless of the manning strategy adopted, it is important to recognise the influence that leadership and management can have on on-board culture. Poor leadership, despite the crewing strategy implemented, can have a detrimental effect on crew wellbeing and safety and ultimately on the budget. Recommendations from this project therefore include greater support for the senior officers both from shore side personnel, and on-going leadership training and development.It is paramount for the ethical and sustainable advancement within shipping, that the highest levels of on-board team working are understood and achieved. This in turn will promote efficient, safe and sustainable working practices that support the best outcomes for the crew.","Navy","Solent University"
"Exploring the suitability and acceptability of peer support for older veterans.","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-the-suitability-and-acceptability-of-peer-support-for-o","Burnell, K.; Needs, A.; Gordon, K.","12 Jun 2017","Purpose: Informal social support is often sought by veterans to support reminiscence or cope with traumatic memories. However, it can also encourage unhelpful ways of coping, such as avoidance, or may be absent altogether. This project borrowed from the growing peer support literature to explore the suitability of peer support services to enhance wellbeing for older veterans, when naturally occurring support is absent or unhelpful.Methodological approach: This was a sequentially staged research programme involving a scoping review of current practice and evidence, and a consultation with veterans. In total, 10 veterans (nine male, 1 female) took part in the consultation (M = 66 years).Findings: Peer support was considered a suitable, particularly in addressing loneliness and social isolation. There was an understandable concern regarding its use with more complex issues such as trauma. An added issue was the implicit assumption that this consultation concerned transition; supporting younger veteran as they move from military to civilian life. This mirrored the focus of current UK policy and affected the focus of the consultation. Issues were also raised around sustainability of services more broadly.Social implications: Peer support is appropriate in supporting older veterans, but must be implemented in a sustainable way. Raising awareness of the needs of older veterans in older adult services is an important implication for service development and delivery.Originality: There is a considerable lack of research concerning older veterans, particularly concerning their formal and informal social support needs. This paper addresses the current gap in the literature.","Navy","Solent University"
"The forgotten keyworkers: challenges faced by British seafarers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/the-forgotten-keyworkers-challenges-faced-by-british-seafarers-as","Devereux, H.; Wadsworth, E.","Aug 2021","The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been far-reaching and one important area which has been impacted is people’s working lives. Workers in many industries have had to navigate new ways of working and organisations have had to make changes to how they operate. One industry in which workers have carried on working much the same as before but in which new – and somewhat unusual – challenges have arisen is the international seafaring industry.This research project used an online questionnaire to explore the experiences of British workers in the seafaring industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its aim was to consider the impact of the pandemic on seafarers and in particular to provide indicative summary evidence from which the industry could develop supports for its workforce at this most challenging time. In this report, we present a descriptive summary of seafarers’ experiences. We structure the findings around five broad themes:1. Organisation of employment2. Health and well-being3. Recruitment, retention and career progression4. Financial impact5. SupportIn doing so we present some of the experiences of an often-forgotten group of workers – totalling around 22,970 men and women – who at the outbreak of the pandemic, were designated as keyworkers by the UK Government (Department for Transport 2021). Given the fact that the UK shipping sector moves 95% of all UK trade it is clear to see why seafarers were considered key workers (UK Chamber of Shipping 2020). Yet, despite the importance of the shipping industry to the UK economy – and the importance of the supply chain as a whole – little attention has been paid to the experiences of these workers.This report therefore sheds light on the experiences of British seafarers during the pandemic. In addition to this report an animated film highlights the key findings from the research project. This report and the animation will be further complemented by discursive publications which consider our key findings in greater depth for particular audiences.","Navy","Solent University"

In doing so, the chapter explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seafarers as individuals and the potential for serious repercussions of such impact for the UK seafaring industry as a whole. The findings indicate a clear need for a coordinated effort from the key stakeholders, including national government and shipping companies, to work together to support the seafaring labour force. Providing sufficient support has the potential to mitigate the risk of increasing numbers of seafarers leaving the profession and reduced numbers choosing to join it, both of which could have profound consequences for the industry and more widely.","Navy","Solent University"

Also, more stringent regulations on exhaust emissions have generated a significant impact on the already delicate market. Leadership in costs is one of the classic strategies to succeed in a competitive environment. Fuel is one of the most important items in the budget to consider when moving cargo across the oceans. However, up to now, there are just a few ships equipped with wind-assisted technologies to reduce fuel expenditures. Positioned in an interdisciplinary framework, this study aims to increase knowledge and understanding about the utilisation of Flettner rotors and parafoil as alternative sources of power to propel merchant vessels. To achieve this purpose, this research draws on data, information, techniques and theories from a variety of sources in both public domain and private databases. The TERA simulation of a parafoil system and Flettner rotors system assisting a 60,000 DWT bulker carrier under different wind patterns was presented. Based on the existing knowledge and scholarship, and the primary data gathered by interviews and questionnaire survey, this paper intends to critically examine the economic benefits derived from the use of two alternative propulsion systems.","Navy","Solent University"

Despite governments’ efforts to improve labour standards and encourage employer-centred voluntary compliance programmes, infringements of workers’ rights are widely reported. Using a qualitative socio-legal study of Chinese seafarers’ workers’ compensation rights, we investigate whether shipping companies and their crewing agencies comply with their legal obligations following workplace injuries and fatalities. Through 74 semi-structured interviews and analysis of crew management policies from 7 shipping companies, we identify a failure of most shipowners’ internal policies to comply with legal obligations. Furthermore, multinational shipping companies use crewing agencies to evade their liabilities to injured seafarers. We propose the establishment of a joint liability mechanism between employers and labour intermediaries to fill this compliance gap that exists in global human resource supply chains.

This contribution is exciting and has the potential to generate significant debate on how best to educate project practitioners both in workplace settings and University courses.  In 2006 the Rethinking Project Management (RPM) network, a collaboration between academics and practitioners reported on their work proposing five directions for future research and practice. The fifth of these proposed a move ‘…from practitioners as trained technicians towards practitioners as reflective practitioners.’ (Winter, Smith, Morris, & Cicmil, 2006, p.642). Critical to this change was a move away from technical training against an established body of knowledge or methodology (Crawford, et al, 2006, p.724) and towards an approach based in active learning and engagement. This thesis demonstrates how such an approach supports participants to develop as reflective, adaptive practitioners who are able and willing to learn on a continuing basis.   The literature review demonstrates a clear gap in knowledge, as Svejvig and Andersen (2015) found only seven published contributions discussing this topic. My review of the literature discovered 15 contributions on educating project managers, mainly practitioner development through University courses; with none mentioning the development of reflective practitioners in the workplace. My research contributes knowledge to this gap by designing a development programme which the collected data shows developed reflective practitioners. The data comes form 25 interviews of delegates on this development programme and a clear improvement in performance is indicated by business metrics.  The research was conducted in a UK unitary authority and applied a dual cycle insider action research approach. There was a business issue to dissolve and the research interests that emerged from this issue formed the dual cycle. ","Navy","Solent University"

A.","10 Aug 2023","Technological advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pursued by artificial intelligence (AI) are improving remote sensing applications in smart agriculture. These are valuable tools for monitoring and disease identification of plants as they can collect data with no damage and effects on plants. However, their limited carrying and battery capacities restrict their performance in larger areas. Therefore, using multiple UAVs, especially in the form of a swarm is more significant for monitoring larger areas such as crop fields and forests. The diversity of research studies necessitates a literature review for more progress and contribution in the agricultural field. In this review, the comparative analysis of existing literature surveys is explored. This paper aims to provide an overview of AI-based UAV swarms, different cameras and sensors, image processing, and machine learning (ML) algorithms for image analysis having the purpose of monitoring and disease identification. Brassica plants are focused as they are grown on wider scales globally. Brassica species, the commonly infected diseases, and different types of disease detection methods are discussed. Investigations show the significance of using UAV swarms for growth monitoring growth for yield estimation, health monitoring, water status monitoring and irrigation management, nutrition disorders monitoring, pest and disease detection, and pesticide and fertilizer spraying in Brassica plants. Finally, some challenges of swarm-based applications are also addressed that require future consideration. The significance of this paper is that it suggests its readers embrace swarm-based technologies in the pursuit of more efficient production with relevant economic benefits.","AI","Solent University"

These changing/challenging conditions have instigated us to revisit the usage of telehealth services to improve the quality of life for people with ASD. This study aims to identify mobile applications that suit the needs of such individuals. This work focuses on identifying features of a number of highly-rated mobile applications (apps) that are designed to assist people with ASD, specifically those features that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. In this study, 250 mobile apps have been retrieved using keywords such as autism, autism AI, and autistic. Among 250 apps, 46 were identified after filtering out irrelevant apps based on defined elimination criteria such as ASD common users, medical staff, and non-medically trained people interacting with people with ASD. In order to review common functionalities and features, 25 apps were downloaded and analysed based on eye tracking, facial expression analysis, use of 3D cartoons, haptic feedback, engaging interface, text-to-speech, use of Applied Behaviour Analysis therapy, Augmentative and Alternative Communication techniques, among others were also deconstructed. As a result, software developers and healthcare professionals can consider the identified features in designing future support tools for autistic people. This study hypothesises that by studying these current features, further recommendations of how existing applications for ASD people could be enhanced using AI for (1) progress tracking, (2) personalised content delivery, (3) automated reasoning, (4) image recognition, and (5) Natural Language Processing (NLP).

In critiquing focus on the drone’s apparent ‘autonomy’, it argues that such devices function as part of a socio-technical network. They are relational parts of human-machine interaction that, in our changing geopolitical realities, have a powerful influence on politics, reputation and warfare. Drawing on Žižek’s conception of parallax, the article stresses the importance of culture and perception in forming the role of the drone in widening power asymmetries. It examines how perceptions of autonomy are evoked by drones, to claim that this misperception is a smokescreen that obscures the relational socio-technical realities of the drone. The article therefore argues that a more critical culture of the drone emerges by shifting the focus and perception from autonomy to anonymity. This allows us to engage more fully with the distributed agency and decision-making that define how drones are developed and deployed. Rather than focusing on the drone as a singular, fetishised, technical object, a relational approach to the drone assemblage is proposed that highlights the competing human interests that define and resist drones in global politics and culture.","AI","Solent University"

Prior studies indicate that AI has the ability to change the ownership and responsibility for managerial decision making, information accumulation and strategic management. Following this line of research, we review the literature of AI and discuss its application in personnel management, particularly from the context of Higher Education Sector (HES). We draw insights from three theoretical perspectives (job replacement, psychological contract and demands-resources), aiming to understand the influence of AI-driven management on the organizations, managers and employees. Specifically, two questions are proposed and critically discussed. First, what might be the opportunities and challenges of AI-driven management? Second, how AI-driven policies could be implemented to the personnel management? Based on the analysis of theoretical perspectives and empirical research findings, we have learnt that managers’ attitude is crucial to the implementation of AI in personnel management, leading to different organizational outcomes. If not handled well, AI-driven management may cause job insecurity and dissatisfaction to the employees. Research findings has brought new insights into the AI-management literature and clarified AI’s applicability in HES. Implications for future studies are discussed.","AI","Solent University"

This process of nationalism was accompanied by colonialism. It was in this context that Venice decided to promote itself by showcasing Italian art alongside the art of other nations. National pavilions were thus offered to participating nations who wanted to take place and showcase their own art. These nations were given the right to own and manage their national pavilion, almost as they saw fit. However, not all countries were invited or wanted to participate in the first instance. Since then the number of participating countries has been growing steadily, but not all national requests have been granted. China joined in 2005 under the condition that Taiwan will no longer be given the right to hold a national exhibition. However, the collateral events have shown work by artists from China well before China's official pavilion. It was predominantly Europeans working in China who invited well known European curators who in turn invited artists from China to participate in collateral events. What the Venice Biennale has shown was the gap between the art promoted by European curators and that promoted by the official government. The paper will focus on the case study of China and will explore the relationship between participation in collateral events and the official pavilion. It will engage with the very different representations of China the official and unofficial, including the participation of artists from China in other nations' pavilion such as Ai Weiwe in the German. The paper will show the different narratives of art and its role in construction national and collective identities which emerged out of the official participation of China and that of artists participating in the collateral events.

From unlocking the secrets of the universe to improving the understanding of our own homeworld, the benefits that the utilisation of space brings are only just being realised. This is particularly true for industry sectors, which are becoming growing ‘users’ of space including the Health & Life Sciences sector. This paper brings voices from within the Health & Life Science Sector and the Space Sector together to ask what are the possibilities of space? How can these be realised? What could this mean for our future? Advances in remote monitoring are already providing information on disease outbreaks & natural disasters to aid response management. Growing ubiquitous connectivity is better enabling the provision of health management particularly in remote locations and utilisation of earth observation techniques are helping inform farming practices. These are just a few examples of how existing space assets are being used to support life on Earth. Platforms ranging from small satellites (e.g. cube-sats) in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), to dedicated laboratories on the International Space Station (ISS) are being utilised to advance our understanding of how certain fundamental processes adapt outside of our home environment. Studying how plants can create root structures in the absence of Earth’s gravity to radiation effects on biological systems, are helping us understand not just how to enhance life on Earth, but also to provide the tools and knowledge for humanity's next age of exploration. Through an open call process this paper has gathered >50 authored contributions from across the research community to help broaden our horizons of the still untapped potential for cross-sector innovation. As the global community seeks to recover post covid-19, the opportunity to galvanise our proven excellence in health and life sciences, and the strong investments in developing sovereign space launch capability, could ultimately become a powerful catalyst for future innovation and strengthen existing global ties. Without the right funding, infrastructure, relationships and agreements, it is challenging for UK scientists to develop and sustain long-term research programmes in collaboration with the international agencies, principally ESA, and other commercial partners. From the thematic chapters and underpinning individual author contributions, there is a need for bridging mechanisms between capability and access to overcome the barriers to do space-related research for both exploration and terrestrial benefit. The recommendations outlined in this paper draw from these diverse inputs to address the current challenges faced by this sector. From life science and human factors, to biomedical, AI and education there are key steps which can help facilitate the unlocking of this potential. Beyond dedicated funding, facilitated community building and knowledge exchange centres will be paramount to ensure a joined up and collaborative exploitation of this cross-sector interface, which can raise the UK’s profile on the International stage. This paper is one of these steps and over time it could become an exercise to take stock, reflect on what other opportunities are on the horizon and create new R&D connections. Beyond the Health and Life Sciences will be other sectoral opportunities, including in energy, materials chemicals and more. This paper provides a potential blueprint for these areas to explore their own ‘Why Space’ journey to ensure that the existing excellence in research is harnessed, cross-sector ideation is championed and new collaborative opportunities for innovation are fostered.","AI","Solent University"

"Dancing to enhance the destination image: Co-Creating a Guinness World Record","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/dancing-to-enhance-the-destination-image-co-creating-a-guinness-w","Arvanitis, P.","11 Jun 2020","Destinations try to become creative in order to enhance, rejuvenate or change their destination image. It is vital to engage local communities in this task and take them on board since the actions of the planners are going to be welcomed and the local community engagement and co creation will be more effective (Black and Veloutsou, 2017). A Guinness world record is a prestigious and effective method to create noise about an event, let alone if the event involves the cooperation of thousands of participants who attempt to break a world record. The local authorities of a city decided that a means to create that was to attempt to break the previous Guinness World Record held by another city when 1650 people danced coordinated and simultaneously. In August 2012 the attempt was made under the strict surveillance of Guinness World Record Officials who validated the attempt of 6514 volunteers who danced syrtaki for their city. The aim of this paper is to address how volunteering and cocreation can enhance a destination’s resilience, use creative marketing strategies and promotional activities to enhance a destination’s image. The paper follows a qualitative approach discussing the preparation and build up to the event considering the challenges of co-creating such an event by volunteer groups and local authorities. The application of choreography in order to enhance the destination image and the co creation of the sense of belonging in conjunction with the cooperation of volunteers organisations and local authorities is explored in this paper (Haanpää, 2017; Wesley et al, 2011).

"Event co-creation in street events: Evidence from Athens Pride","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/event-co-creation-in-street-events-evidence-from-athens-pride","Karadimitriou, C.; Arvanitis, P.","11 Jun 2020","Street events usually provide a unique experience closely related to co-creation, since there is a high potential for peoples’ participation that travel in order to attend the street event and interact with the other participants. (Binkhorst & Dekker, 2009). The main character of a street event is that all the individuals act together to create a specific value, which is a structural element of the event co-creation (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004; Vargo & Lusch, 2004). This reciprocal relationship between all the involved parts is vital for co-creation (Friedman et al., 2004). The main characteristics of event co-creation fit in with the stakeholder theory, where event organizers tend to create suitable conditions in order to utilize the capabilities of all the participants (Freeman, 1984). The study was conducted during 2019 Athens Pride, which was held on 8th June 2019. Through structured questionnaires 400 adult attendees were asked to participate on the research, whilst 312 useful questionnaires were collected. The aim of the study was to examine Athens Pride co-creation aspects by evaluating emotional closeness, community commitment, community support, participation incentives, emotional impact, and the brand image of the event. The research also included the examination of three socio-demographics (age; level of education; sexual orientation). Data analysis was based on the use of Structural Equation Modeling, whilst Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used since all items were adopted from previous studies. Reliability and Validity were examined through Cronbach A, Average Variance Expplained (AVE) and Composite Reliability (CR). The results indicate that all the examined socio-demographics have an effect upon the independent constructs, whilst age and the level of education appear to be the most important ones. Moreover, all the examined constructs appear to influence event cocreation. Participation incentives seem to have the highest effect upon event co-creation, followed by the emotional closeness, and the community commitment. The theoretical contribution of the research lies on the provision of a better understanding in terms of street events’ co- creation, with special reference to Athens Pride.

The study conducted a comprehensive systematic review, after meticulous screening, 20 eligible papers were selected, forming the foundation for deriving the key components of the DAP framework. Subsequently, a qualitative focus group study engaged 18 participants from diverse sectors to evaluate the practical applicability of the DAP conceptual framework. Thematic analysis of the focus group sessions revealed five key themes: practical value, pragmatic performance, ethical perspective, clarity of the framework, and enhancement tools. These findings offer valuable insights for refining the DAP framework and optimising its integration into real-world scenarios, in empowering individuals in smart cities, especially those with disabilities. Future research should explore larger and more diverse samples to generalise findings and assess the framework's long-term impact through longitudinal evaluations. By adopting user-centred methodologies, the DAP framework can be further enhanced as a strategic tool, empowering data to actively participate in organisational decision-making processes.","AI","Solent University"
"Domestic Tourism at Mountain Destinations; evidence from Central Greece","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/domestic-tourism-at-mountain-destinations-evidence-from-central-g","Arvanitis, P.","11 Jun 2020","Domestic Tourism is an area that has not been extensively researched in comparison to international tourism. Moreover, mountain tourism is highly linked to skiing and other snow related activities. This area becomes even less researched when the country is considered a popular sea and sun summer destination where international and domestic tourist arrivals peak during the summer months. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the value of domestic mountain tourism at a popular domestic destination which is not accessible by plane, therefore international tourists find it harder to reach since there are not nearby flights available. From a regional perspective, the paper addresses the impact the financial crisis had on domestic tourism length of stay and spending based on official reports and studies. Domestic tourism in Greece since the financial crisis was severely affected resulting to a decrease of over 65%.Destinations that have been predominantly popular amongst the domestic market have been the ones affected the most and they had to show resilience to adapt to the challenges that occurred. The empirical part of the study consists of primary data randomly selected by questionnaire during the holiday period between Christmas and New Year, a period where the destination is experiencing high occupancy rates and visitor numbers. The analysis of the data indicates that there are some dominant source markets followed by a high proportion of day visitors who could potentially convert to tourists. The findings of this paper contribute to the literature regarding domestic and mountain destinations, not necessarily linked to snow activities. Conclusions can be applied to otherpopular domestic destinations not only in Greece but other countries too and applied accordingly for their benefit.","AI","Solent University"

Box-Behnken   design   was   applied   to   investigate the effects of pH, the amount of carriers, initial H2O2 and initial Fe2+ concentration on the treatment performance in terms of 2,4-DCP, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total iron removal efficiencies. Results showed that H2O2 concentration had more profound effect than Fe2+ in terms of 2,4-DCP removal while, pH and the amount of carriers did not have an obvious effect on 2,4-DCP degradation.  Increasing  H2O2  concentrations  could  improve  COD  removal  whereas  increasing  Fe2+concentration more than 0.55 mM would decrease COD removal. The decreased COD performance was  probably  due  to  hydroxyl  radical  scavenging  effects.  Results  also  revealed  the  optimum  condition for degrade 2,4-DCP, from the Box-Behnken design prediction: pH 3, 100 g of SiO2, 0.25 mM  of  Fe2+  and  10  mM  of  H2O2.  Under  this  conditions,  2,4-DCP,  COD  and  total  iron  removal  efficiencies  were  >  99,  55  and  14%,  respectively.

Workers in many industries have had to navigate new ways of working and organisations have had to make changes to how they operate. One industry in which workers have carried on working much the same as before but in which new – and somewhat unusual – challenges have arisen is the international seafaring industry.This research project used an online questionnaire to explore the experiences of British workers in the seafaring industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its aim was to consider the impact of the pandemic on seafarers and in particular to provide indicative summary evidence from which the industry could develop supports for its workforce at this most challenging time. In this report, we present a descriptive summary of seafarers’ experiences. We structure the findings around five broad themes:1. Organisation of employment2. Health and well-being3. Recruitment, retention and career progression4. Financial impact5. SupportIn doing so we present some of the experiences of an often-forgotten group of workers – totalling around 22,970 men and women – who at the outbreak of the pandemic, were designated as keyworkers by the UK Government (Department for Transport 2021). Given the fact that the UK shipping sector moves 95% of all UK trade it is clear to see why seafarers were considered key workers (UK Chamber of Shipping 2020). Yet, despite the importance of the shipping industry to the UK economy – and the importance of the supply chain as a whole – little attention has been paid to the experiences of these workers.This report therefore sheds light on the experiences of British seafarers during the pandemic. In addition to this report an animated film highlights the key findings from the research project. This report and the animation will be further complemented by discursive publications which consider our key findings in greater depth for particular audiences.","AI","Solent University"

These two conceptions of privacy can be seen as successive historical epochs brought together under digital technologies, yielding increasingly complex socio-technical dilemmas. By simplifying the taxonomy to its socio-cultural function, the article provides a generalisable, interdisciplinary approach to privacy. Drawing on new technologies, historical trends, sociological studies and political philosophy, the article presents a discussion of the value of privacy as a term, before proposing a defense of the term cyber security as a mode of scalable cognitive privacy that integrates the relative needs of individuals, governments and corporations.","AI","Solent University"

MALSEND is an analytical platform that consists of information about UK Destinations Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey results from 2012 to 2017. The dataset of 270,934 student records with a known disability provides anonymised information about students' age range, year of study, disability type, results of the first degree, among others. Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, characteristics of disabled candidates during and after school years were investigated to identify their engagement patterns. This article builds on constructing and selecting subsets of features useful to build a good predictor regarding the engagement of disabled students 6 months after graduation using the big data approach with machine learning principles. Features such as age, institution, disability type, among others were found to be essential predictors of the proposed employment model.

OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this literature review was to determine, whether or not the currently published anthropometric studies of school children, related to ergonomics, mentioned or evaluated the variables precision, reliability or accuracy in the direct manual measurement method. METHODS:Two bibliographic databases, and the bibliographic references of all the selected papers were used for finding relevant published papers in the fields considered in this study. RESULTS:Forty-six (46) studies met the criteria previously defined for this literature review. However, only ten (10) studies mentioned at least one of the analyzed variables, and none has evaluated all of them. Only reliability was assessed by three papers. Moreover, in what regards the factors that affect precision, reliability and accuracy, the reviewed papers presented large differences. This was particularly clear in the instruments used for the measurements, which were not consistent throughout the studies. Additionally, it was also clear that there was a lack of information regarding the evaluators’ training and procedures for anthropometric data collection, which are assumed to be the most important issues that affect precision, reliability and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS:Based on the review of the literature, it was possible to conclude that the considered anthropometric studies had not focused their attention to the analysis of precision, reliability and accuracy of the manual measurement methods. Hence, and with the aim of avoiding measurement errors and misleading data, anthropometric studies should put more efforts and care on testing measurement error and defining the procedures used to collect anthropometric data.","AI","Solent University"

However, observing such ecological violence and their implications often requires finding the right perspective, moving beyond the spatial and temporal limits of individual humans. This article builds on discussion of the Anthropocene as a term and the anthropocentrism it implies to critique the relations between humanity, technology and ecology through posthuman perspectives. Focusing on Google’s widely available tools, its problematic relation to the environment as a company, and critical interventions by media artists Mishka Henner, Paolo Cirio and Geraldine Juárez, the article examines technologies that enable a ‘posthuman’ position from which to view the fractal activities of humanity: Google maps and Earth; Street View; and the Google search engines. Fractals are offered as a mode of assessing the self-similar processes of mediation that define not only humanity’s scalar expansion but also its shift into informational dimensions and the virtualisation of ecology.","AI","Solent University"

This review synthesizes the evidence regarding the influence of asthma on PA and sedentary time and evaluates the role of key moderators for this relationship. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, six electronic databases and gray literature were searched. Primary studies in English were included if they reported device-assessed PA in youth with and without asthma. Random effects meta-analyses examined the effect of asthma on PA and, separately, sedentary time. Mixed-effect meta-regression analyses were conducted using age and sex as moderators, with sub-group comparisons for study quality and asthma diagnosis criteria. Overall, of 3944 citations retrieved, 2850 were screened after the removal of supplication and 2743 citations excluded. Of the 107 full-text publications reviewed, 16 were included in data extraction and analysis, with 15 and five studies included in the PA and sedentary time meta-analyses, respectively. The robust effect size estimate for the influence of asthma on PA and sedentary time was -0.04 [95% CI = -0.11, 0.03] and -0.09 [95% CI = -0.12, -0.06], indicating a non-significant and significant trivial effect, respectively. The effect of asthma on PA levels or sedentary time was not associated with age or sex. Youth with controlled asthma are equally physically (in)active as their healthy peers, with asthma associated with less sedentary time. However, methodological limitations and a paucity of clear methodological reporting temper these conclusions. More rigorous device-based assessments, with a particular focus on sedentary time, and more robust diagnoses of asthma, especially with regard to severity, are needed.","AI","Solent University"

"Digital Society: Regulating privacy and content online","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/digital-society-regulating-privacy-and-content-online","Benjamin, G.","Sept 2020","Society increasingly relies on digital platforms. But regulation of how we interact with social media, search engines or other online platforms has so far been unsuccessful in preventing harms, ensuring rights are upheld or empowering citizens to engage in digital society. Current laws tend to separate issues out into privacy and online content. This has the advantage of giving clear remits to regulators and focusing energy, resources and expertise on specic issues. But it also holds regulators and policy-makers back when it comes to tackling larger systemic issues. This report argues for broader regulation that brings together the ways data about individuals goes out (privacy or data protection) and how the information they receive comes in (recommendations for online content, particularly when harmful and/or political). This currently spans multiple government departments and regulators in the UK, creating overlaps in some areas but leaving gaping holes in others. At a time when we are relying more and more on large platforms with huge amounts of power, it is essential to empower citizens, communities, smaller organisations, and government, to tip the balance away from a few big tech executives. Only by taking a more comprehensive and cohesive approach can regulation promote rights, justice and equity for a more positive digital society.","AI","Solent University"

As the globe works to cut greenhouse gas emissions and lessen the effects of climate change, decarbonizing the maritime sector has become an urgent problem in recent years. Fossil fuel combustion is the leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, which have a role in climate change and global warming. It entails moving away from energy based on fossil fuels and toward greener, lower-carbon options, including renewable energy, energy-saving devices, and sustainable mobility. The necessity of coordination and cooperation between various stakeholders is one of the significant obstacles to decarbonizing the maritime sector. Governments, shipping firms, and other stakeholders must collaborate to develop and put into practice sustainable solutions because shipping is a global sector. In this research, the author examines the difficulties and possibilities of decarbonizing the shipping sector and the development achieved in this direction. This study investigates the decarbonization prospects available to shipping businesses, the regulatory framework, and alternatives to fossil fuels through a thorough assessment of the literature and data analysis.

"Applications of concurrent access patterns in web usage mining","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/applications-of-concurrent-access-patterns-in-web-usage-mining","Lu, J.; Keech, M.; Wang, C.","1 Aug 2013","This paper builds on the original data mining and modelling research which has proposed the discovery of novel structural relation patterns, applying the approach in web usage mining. The focus of attention here is on concurrent access patterns (CAP), where an overarching framework illuminates the methodology for web access patterns post-processing. Data pre-processing, pattern discovery and patterns analysis all proceed in association with access patterns mining, CAP mining and CAP modelling. Pruning and selection of access pat-terns takes place as necessary, allowing further CAP mining and modelling to be pursued in the search for the most interesting concurrent access patterns. It is shown that higher level CAPs can be modelled in a way which brings greater structure to bear on the process of knowledge discovery. Experiments with real-world datasets highlight the applicability of the approach in web navigation.","AI","Solent University"

"Translating design details to construction details – with both eyes open","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/translating-design-details-to-construction-details-with-both-eyes","Sajjadian, S. M.","Dec 2017","Sustainable designs will come to nothing if they are lost in construction process. Therefore, the accuracy of design details and the transformation to the construction details is vital to achieve initial design thinking targets. This is driven most importantly by the fact that the UK Government strategy for all newhomes is on the basis of “fabric first” approach to design. This illustrates that priority is on improving energy efficiency through building envelope by increasing insulation thickness; reducing thermal bridging risks as wellas making buildings more airtight. This study uses a residential building in Wales, UK as a case study to demonstrate how UK government approach is applied both in design stage and construction stage to meetessential building standards. The methodology includes dynamic thermal simulations, 2D thermal bridge analysis of the construction details and diagnostic test using air permeability test. Results demonstrate thatfabric-first approach applied by contractors in housing development is not only able to rectify design errors but also is able to achieve even higher standard levels in some cases.

"High Education: towards development of innovative human capital","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/high-education-towards-development-of-innovative-human-capital","Penev, K.; Rees, J.","1 Apr 2009","This article discusses an activity based approach for teaching and learning applied in Higher Education to the development of Human Capital capability. According to the Leif Edvinsson, in one of the classic works in the area of Knowledge Management, Human Capital plays a significant role in overall Intellectual Capital. ?? Intellectual capital is the sum of structural capital and human capital. Human capital refers to the knowledge, skill, and experience of the employees. Structural capital refers to the extension and manifestation of human capital. It includes tangibles such as the information technology systems, brand and company images, customer databases, organizational concepts and manuals.? [Bucklew and Edvinsson, 1999] From other, social and economics points of view, Eva Gamarnikow and Antony Green summarised Human Capital thus: ?In economic, capital refers to resources (whether financial or physical) that are used for the production of goods. It can also refer to all resources that bring in income. Social Capital and Human Capital are terms used in the social science to discuss analogous concepts with regard to social resources derived from social interaction (social capital) and individual development (human capital).? [Gamarnicow, 2003] For Higher Education in general, and for the development of activity based teaching and learning in particular, a comprehensive understanding of human capital is essential. Gamarnikow and Green clarify: ?There are at least four ways of thinking about human capital. For economists, human capital has a specific, narrow meaning: It refers to the opportunity cost of individuals' or states' investing in education-forgone earnings plus the cost of education set against expectations of future (higher) earnings and economic productivity, respectively. At the other extreme, the term human capital is often as used merely as popular shorthand for education in general. The two intermediate perspectives are much more critical and compare the human capital approach to education unfavourably with other approaches. The first of these critical perspectives focuses on the social role of education. ? The other critical perspective focuses on the ways in which education operates at the level of the individual. It criticises the human capital approach for reducing education to the inculcation of marketable skills rather than taking a holistic approach and educating the whole person.? As part of its strategic plans to support development of the Knowledge-based Economy, Southampton Solent University (SSU) aims to advance appropriate programmes of study. For this purpose an activity based approach for teaching and learning is in process of deployment at Faculty of Technology at SSU. The article discusses definitions of Intellectual Capital, Human Capital, Social Capital, Knowledge Management and Knowledge, their interaction in the global information environment and in the particular context of Higher Education. It presents also the principles and design of an activity-based model for learning and teaching and relevant illustrations.","AI","Solent University"
"The validation of non-technical behavioural markers for Merchant Navy officers","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/the-validation-of-non-technical-behavioural-markers-for-merchant-","Devitt, K.; Holford, S.; Pantaleev, B.; Sharma, D.","2012","Resource Management principles, first established in the aviation industry, have been adapted and adopted for other safety critical applications where the importance of the blend of effective technical and non-technical skills is recognised. The revisions to the STCW Code include requirements for deck and engineering officers to show competence at the operational level in the non-technical skills of Resource Management. These Resource Management competencies do not align fully with other industries? established criteria. The many unique aspects of the international maritime industry make the wholesale adoption of established criteria from another industry inappropriate. The initial stage of this research ? presented at the 4th International Conference on Maritime Human Resource Solutions in 2010 - set out to identify if the broad competence criteria described in the STCW revisions would be consistently interpreted by a range of industry stakeholders, in the context of the behaviours that they would expect to see, hear or experience that would demonstrate compliance with, and evidence competence in, the criteria. To this end, data was collected by purposeful sampling of industry stakeholders and semi-structured interviews undertaken. Effective and ineffective markers were then developed. The second stage of research has now been completed. This paper will report on how these markers were validated for effectiveness and utility in WMA deck and engine simulators, and consider some implementation considerations. These behavioural markers will enable industry to assess the performance of the deck and engine room teams and to improve selection, training and promotion processes and procedures for Merchant Navy officers.","AI","Solent University"

It happens overtly and behind the scenes. It is a specific moment of legal obligation, the point at which the purpose and conditions of the data are legitimised. But what does the term data collection mean? What does it say or not say? Does it really capture the extraction or imposition taking place? How do terms and practices relate in defining the norms of data in society? This article undertakes a critique of data collection using data feminism and a performative theory of privacy: as a resource, an objective discovery and an assumption. It also discusses alternative terms and the implications of how we describe practices of ‘collecting’ data.","AI","Solent University"
"Human Rights in the Time of HIV/AIDS","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/human-rights-in-the-time-of-hivaids","Maina, R.","2020","Over the last decade or so, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has reported a marked decline in AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections. Yet people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs), especially those in the most affected, less industrialized regions of the global south, continue to face problems associated with the illness, among them stigma, discrimination and limited access to healthcare needs such as life-prolonging antiretroviral drugs (ARVs, also referred to as antiretroviral therapy (ART)). PLWHA and HIV/AIDS advocacy groups have long employed human rights as a weapon in the struggle to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and the suffering of PLWHAs, and to attain and secure better conditions and health provisions for the infected and the affected. This article, based on research conducted in Kenya at the height of the AIDS crisis in the early to mid 2000s, examines PLWHAs’ awareness of human rights, the sources that they cite for such information, and any perceived links that they identify between their illness and the subject of human rights. In doing so, it approaches the rights discussion from the less familiar perspective of the PLWHAs themselves, seeking to gain an insight into how this group encounters, internalises and articulates – or not – the language and norms of human rights, and what this may tell us about the role of HIV/AIDS in shaping their subjectivities.

"Air transport liberalisation and airport dependency: developing a composite index","https://pure.solent.ac.uk/en/publications/air-transport-liberalisation-and-airport-dependency-developing-a-","Arvanitis, P.; Papatheodorou, A.; Koo; Halpern, N.; Graham","2016","Air transport liberalisation in Europe has produced some major changes to the networks operated by airlines and the services available at airports. Within this context the degree of airport dependency in terms of market, spatial and temporal concentration is important to know from an economic geography and risk management perspective. A composite index called the Airport Dependency Index (ADI) is developed to measure airport dependency based on the concept of the relative Gini coefficient. Liberalisation has had varying impacts depending on the size and type of airport and so a comparison is made of the degree of dependency at a large sample of European airports using the ADI. The ADI has the potential to provide insight on the sustainability and worthiness of financing airport projects, and on whether airports should diversify further their activities by investing in the growth and expansion of their network.","AI","Solent University"

Participants People with dementia and their family carers were the participants.Interventions Treatment as usual (TAU) plus one of the following: one-to-one peer support to family carers from experienced carers (Carer Supporter Programme; CSP), group reminiscence therapy (Remembering Yesterday, Caring Today; RYCT) for people with dementia and carers, both or neither.Main outcome measures Primary outcomes included health-related quality of life (SF-12) for carers and quality of life (QoL-AD) for people with dementia; secondary outcomes included quality of relationship for carers and people with dementia; both were collected by blinded assessors at baseline, 5 and 12 months ( primary end point).Results Of 291 pairs recruited, we randomised 145 (50%) to CSP (71% uptake) and 194 (67%) to RYCT (61% uptake). CSP and RYCT, separately or together, were not effective in improving primary outcomes or most secondary outcomes. For CSP versus ‘no CSP’, adjusted difference in means was 0.52 points on the SF- 12 (95% CI −1.28 to 2.32) and −0.08 points on the QoL-AD (95% CI −1.70 to 1.56). For RYCT versus ‘no RYCT’, the difference was 0.10 points on the SF-12 (95% CI −1.72 to 1.93) and 0.51 points on the QoL- AD (95% CI −1.17 to 2.08). However, carers reported better relationships with the people with dementia (difference 1.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.21, p=0.05). Comparison of combined intervention with TAU, and of intervention received, suggested differential impacts for carers and persons with dementia.Conclusions There is no evidence from the trial that either peer support or reminiscence is effective in improving the quality of life.Trial registration number ISRCTN37956201; Results.","AI","Solent University"
