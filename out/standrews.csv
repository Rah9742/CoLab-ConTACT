"Financial literacy and responsible finance in the FinTech era : capabilities and challenges  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/23739","Panos, Georgios; Wilson, John O. S.","February 2020","A growing body of evidence suggests that financial literacy plays an important role in financial well-being, and that differences in financial knowledge acquired early in life can explain a significant part of financial and more general well-being in adult life. Financial technology (FinTech) is revolutionising the financial services industry at an unrivalled pace. Views differ regarding the likely impact that FinTech is likely to have on personal financial planning, well-being and societal welfare. In an era of mounting student debt, increased (digital) financial inclusion, and threats arising from instances of (online) financial fraud, financial education and enlightened financial advising appropriate policy interventions that enhance financial and overall well-being. This special issue engages in this important academic and policy agenda by presenting a set of seven new papers emanating from four parallel streams of literature related to financial literacy and responsible finance.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"On the persistence of output fluctuations in high technology sectors  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/652","Lasselle, Laurence; Aloi, Marta; McMillan, David G.","April 2000","Fatás (2000) argues that in a cross-section analysis of countries there exists a positive correlation between long-term growth rates and the persistence of output fluctuations. The current paper extends this line of research by examining manufacturing sectors of an economy which can be characterised by two levels of technology; a low level and a high level. Analysis of the data reveals a positive correlation between long-term growth rates and the persistence of output fluctuations in ‘high-tech’ sectors. This empirical analysis is further supported by reformulating the model of Matsuyama (1999b) in a stochastic environment. Within this framework the model is able to capture the two main theories of growth, namely; the Solow model and the Romer model. The stochastic nature of the long run output trend is endogenous and based on technological shocks. Despite the cyclical nature of the shocks we are able to show that output fluctuations are more persistent in ‘high-tech’ sectors.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"High technology firm performance, innovation, and networks : an empirical analysis of firms in Scottish high technology clusters  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/539","Ujjual, Vandana","April 2008","This thesis is an empirical analysis of the performance, innovation and networks of high technology firms. It is conducted at the micro-economic level, based on new empirical evidence by fieldwork methods, from the primary source data on firms in the five Scottish hi-tech clusters. The questionnaire design is cross-sectional, to which was added a time series element, and involves many unique features. It enabled the gathering of rich quantitative and qualitative data on all stages of the dynamic innovation process. The database was used in cross-sectional analysis of many key hypotheses in the hi-tech context, by robust econometric models of export, innovation (e.g. Schumpeterian hypothesis), and growth (e.g. Gibrat’s Law of Proportionate Effect) performances. The hi- tech firm’s networks, internationalisation and embeddeddness, are analysed using novel measures. A structural simultaneous equations model is developed to explain the relationship between networks, innovation and performance, by establishing a link between the innovation input, the innovation output, and performance, based on the empirical knowledge production function model. The 2-stage, 4 equations model, (using Heckman’s procedure) deals with both simultaneity and sample selection bias. Robust estimation techniques (I3SLS, Tobit) are used for estimation. The results highlight the simultaneity and selectivity issue. The hi-tech firms with aggressive innovation strategies, international markets and global products, still find it vital to be embedded in local networks, which in turn raise their performance. Technology-push factors, research networks, knowledge spillovers from markets, and a firm’s radical innovation attempts determine its innovation input intensity. Firms are unable to attain innovation success through innovation investments alone; integration of internal and external resources is important. The innovation sales intensity are not determined by innovation input, but by the demand-pull factors like customer networks, exporting, and market expansion strategies. This also applies to their export intensity. Lack of internal resources, capabilities, and government support are the major obstacles to commercialisation of innovation.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Exploring the experiences and views of doctors working with Artificial Intelligence in English healthcare : a qualitative study  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/27575","Ganapathi, Shaswath; Duggal, Sandhya","March 2023","Background The National Health Service (NHS) aspires to be a world leader of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, however, there are several barriers facing translation and implementation. A key enabler of AI within the NHS is the education and engagement of doctors, however evidence suggests that there is an overall lack of awareness of and engagement with AI. Research aim This qualitative study explores the experiences and views of doctor developers working with AI within the NHS exploring; their role within medical AI discourse, their views on the implementation of AI more widely and how they consider the engagement of doctors with AI technologies may increase in the future. Methods This study involved eleven semi-structured, one-to-one interviews conducted with doctors working with AI in English healthcare. Data was subjected to thematic analysis. Results The findings demonstrate that there is an unstructured pathway for doctors to enter the field of AI. The doctors described the various challenges they had experienced during their career, with many arising from the differing demands of operating in a commercial and technological environment. The perceived awareness and engagement among frontline doctors was low, with two prominent barriers being the hype surrounding AI and a lack of protected time. The engagement of doctors is vital for both the development and adoption of AI. Conclusions AI offers big potential within the medical field but is still in its infancy. For the NHS to leverage the benefits of AI, it must educate and empower current and future doctors. This can be achieved through; informative education within the medical undergraduate curriculum, protecting time for current doctors to develop understanding and providing flexible opportunities for NHS doctors to explore this field.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

We study the dynamics and features of the so-called Optics Valley of China (OVC) in Hubei, aiming to explore the characteristics of an embryonic local innovation system constructed in a less-favoured region. The results show that institutional factors are the leading forces in a cultivated science park like the OVC. However, along with the shifting focus of the local government, the OVC’s industrial scale has remained small and its industrial chain has remained incomplete. Moreover, the lack of trust and interactions between various components in this innovation system has been highly noticeable. All these features may be seen as warnings to the OVC that a revision of this innovation system is needed in order to avoid the fate of becoming an ‘optical illusion’.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"The Virtual Time Travel Platform : engineering a generic framework for immersive cultural heritage scenes  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/29420","McCaffery, John","June 2015","This thesis presents the Virtual Time Travel Platform (VTTP), a flexible platform for creating, sharing and deploying interactive cultural heritage content across a diverse range of contexts. The interactive scenes created using the VTTP enable experiential learning on cultural heritage topics. The VTTP supports the creation of scenes using freely available tools. These scenes can then be deployed into museums, schools and across the Internet through a process of reconfiguration rather than  redevelopment. The VTTP enables high tech, immersive exhibits to be produced with a budget and a flexibility that is suitable for co-creation with community museums as opposed to national institutions. To date the VTTP has been used to deploy three heterogenous museum exhibits across Scotland which have been visited by more than 10,000 visitors in the 18 months since the first one went  live. This thesis presents an evaluation of the success of these exhibits at engaging the public with the topics they present.  The VTTP was created by augmenting existing Open Virtual World (OVW) software (OpenSim) to support installation into museums. The component which adds this functionality is a bespoke application called Chimera. Chimera supports immersive displays, Natural User Input (NUI) control and the embedding of experiential exploration as part of a larger context suitable for museums. The extension of OVW technology to enable museum deployment is the major contribution of this work.  To support the museum deployments a quantitative analysis of the VTTP Viewer component is presented. This evaluates the impact  of Viewer quality of service onuser quality of experience and suggests heuristics for optimising VTTP deployments.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

"Myth-busting and entrepreneurship policy : the case of high growth firms  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/15819","Brown, Ross; Mawson, Suzanne; Mason, Colin","April 2017","Promoting high growth firms (HGFs) has become a strong fixation within enterprise policy. This is a debate article seeking to examine and challenge the mythology perpetuated by policy makers and embedded within high growth entrepreneurship policy frameworks. Within the article we argue that a number of distinctive ‘myths’ have become deeply embedded within these policy frameworks. Such myths have been built on misconceived preconceptions of HGFs, which has resulted in policy-makers taking a myopic view of these firms. A key aim of the paper is to highlight how false perceptions of HGFs translate into inappropriate policy interventions. The paper challenges some of the most commonly held myths about these firms (that they are predominantly young, small, high-tech, VC-backed, university spin-outs, who grow in an orderly organic fashion, operating similarly irrespective of location) and identifies a clear mismatch between how policy makers perceive HGFs and what they actually look like in reality. Suggestions for the design of future policy approaches are forwarded.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

"Comparing pre- and post-construction distributions of long-tailed ducks Clangula hyemalis in and around the Nysted offshore wind farm, Denmark : a quasi-designed experiment accounting for imperfect detection, local surface features and autocorrelation  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/2008","Petersen, Ib Krag; MacKenzie, Monique Lea; Rexstad, Eric; Wisz, Mary S.; Fox, Anthony D.","April 2011","We report a novel technique to model abundance patterns of wintering seaducks in relation to the construction of an offshore wind farm (OWF) based on seven years of aerial survey transect data. Distance sampling was used to estimate seaduck densities adjusted for covariates affecting detection probabilities. A generalized additive model (GAM) generated seaduck densities in sampling units in relation to spatially explicit covariates, using bootstrapping to account for uncertainties in both processes. Generalized estimating equations generated precision measures for the GAM robust to spatial and temporal autocorrelation. Comparison of pre- and post-construction model generated surfaces showed significant reductions in long-tailed duck numbers only within the OWF (despite the fact that the model was uninformed about the OWF location), although the absolute numbers involved were trivial in a flyway population context. This method provides quantification of distributional effects on organisms over a gradient in space and time that offers an alternative to Before-After/Control-Impact designs in environmental impact assessment.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Mapping the lethal autonomous weapons debate : an introduction  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/29039","Jackson, Josephine","December 2023","The UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) can, on the one hand, be considered vital for the global governance process—in the sense of urging international cooperation on the ethical, developmental, and standards aspects of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). On the other hand, the CCW may also embody a global trend that does not augur well for international solidarity, namely the lack of credible and comprehensive collaboration to advance global objectives of peace and security. In 2022, a majority of the 125 nations that belong to the CCW requested limits on a specific type of lethal autonomous weapons: “killer robots.” Yet, most of the major global powers—namely the United States, Russia, and China—opposed not only a ban on LAWS but also on any restrictions on the development of these weapons, not least because the United States, Russia, and China are actively developing this weapons technology. While there is currently much focus on the technological evolution of LAWS, less has been written about how ethical values can exert influence on a growing global consciousness around factors such as power, technology, human judgment, accountability, autonomy, dehumanization, and the use of force. This introduction lays the groundwork for dealing with these issues. It does so by showing that all these factors warrant a pluralist approach to the global governance of LAWS, based on multiple grounds, including the military, tech, law, and distinctive theoretical-ethical orientations; the rationale being to combine this expertise into a collection for publication. Reflecting the contributing authors’ firsthand experiences of the ethics surrounding the management of LAWS to address decisive and critical questions at an expert level, it provides a framing for the collection, showing that the use of international legal mechanisms like the CCW are crucial to considering both the potential and the limits of LAWS, as well as what it can contribute to areas such as international law, human rights, and national security.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Cooperative financial institutions : a review of the literature  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/24353","McKillop, Donal; French, Declan; Quinn, Barry; Sobiech, Anna L.; Wilson, John O. S.","October 2020","Financial cooperatives play an important role in the financial systems of many countries. They act as a safe haven for deposits and are major sources of credit for households and small- and medium-sized firms. A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases) and a focus on maximising benefits to members have ensured the enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives. This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis when financial cooperatives continued to extend credit to members as many profit-orientated commercial banks restricted credit to households and firms. The overarching theme of the first part of this review is the structural and behavioural characteristics of financial cooperatives. In this part we consider, the origin and diffusion of financial cooperatives, network arrangements, the business model, relationship banking, balancing the interest of members, tax treatment and regulatory framework. The second part has performance and contribution to the real economy as the overarching theme. In this part we consider, efficiency and sustainability, mergers, acquisitions and failures, the benefits (and challenges) of FinTech and the contribution of financial cooperatives to the real economy including during times of crisis. The paper concludes with a summary of what we now know (and do not know) about financial cooperatives and provides suggestions as to where future research may usefully concentrate.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Despite being relatively low grade (c. 2 wt% TREO) compared to conventionally exploited REE phases, eudialyte is attractive for exploitation because of its (1) associated enrichment in other critical metals e.g. Zr, Nb and Ta; (2) high proportions of heavy relative to light REE (up to 1:1), (3) low U and Th contents, and (4) easy magnetic separation.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Entrepreneurial acquisitions, open innovation and UK high growth SMEs  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/13147","Mawson, Suzanne; Brown, Ross Crawford","April 2017","This paper examines the dynamics of entrepreneurial acquisitions undertaken by UK high growth small and medium enterprises (SMEs). While entrepreneurial acquisitions are increasingly deployed by SMEs, little is known about their antecedents, motivational drivers and organisational outcomes. Drawing on detailed case study evidence from Scotland, the key factor found to be driving these acquisitions was the desire to augment and exploit technological complementarities between the acquiring and acquired firms. Acquisition can therefore be conceptualised as an advanced stage of the outside-in ‘open innovation’ strategies proactively used within these innovative SMEs. Firms executing this strategy typically have an acute propensity for risk, a desire for close customer engagement, effective business models and strong external orientation. The work suggests that greater attention should be paid within M&A theory to the dynamics of these kind of smaller scale entrepreneurial acquisitions.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Targeted support for high growth firms : theoretical constraints, unintended consequences and future policy challenges  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/7899","Brown, Ross Crawford; Mawson, Suzanne","August 2016","High growth firms are now a major focus within enterprise policy. This paper provides a theoretically informed analysis of the rationale and effectiveness of targeted public sector support designed to support these firms. Drawing on empirical research undertaken in the UK, this paper challenges the appropriateness of the theoretical assumptions embodied in these state-backed support instruments. It outlines the nature of these programmes and provides a critique of some of their inherent weaknesses, revealing that the assumptions underpinning these programmes are often flawed. The paper examines the limitations of their selection procedures, the thematic nature of support and exit dynamics. It found that offering early stage firms intensive levels of resources may have important unintended consequences previously overlooked by policy makers. The paper offers some suggestions for how policy instruments could be better attuned to the needs of these growth-oriented firms.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Rather than just the total fatty acid compositions, the analysis of individual lipid species within these oils and fats has become increasingly important. Within the past decade several mass spectrometric lipidomics methods have been adapted and applied to the analysis of edible oils and fats. These methodologies are vital for the analysis of a plethora of lipid species that will be important for numerous health and sustainability issues in the future.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a non‐volatile memory using a material whose resistance changes under electrical stimulus can be seen as the most promising candidate for next generation memory both as embedded memory and a stand‐alone memory due to its high speed, long retention time, low power consumption, scalability and simple structure. Among carbon‐based materials, graphene has emerged as wonder material with remarkable properties. In contrast to metallic nature of graphene, the graphene oxide (GO) is good insulating/semiconducting material and suitable for RRAM devices. The advantage of being atomically thin and the two-dimensional of GO permits scaling beyond the current limits of semiconductor technology, which is a key aspect for high‐density fabrication. Graphene oxide‐based resistive memory devices have several advantages over other oxide materials, such as easy synthesis and cost‐effective device fabrication, scaling down to few nanometre and compatibility for flexible device applications. In this chapter, we discuss the GO‐based RRAM devices, which have shown the properties of forming free, thermally stable, multi‐bit storage, flexible and high on/off ratio at low voltage, which boost up the research and development to accelerate the GO‐based RRAM devices for future memory applications.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Confusion and collectivism in the ICT sector : is FLOSS the answer?  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/10188","Marks, Abigail; Chillas, Shiona; Galloway, Laura; Maclean, Gavin","February 2020","Information and communication technology (ICT) workers rarely join trade unions. This is usually explained by the individualised nature of work. We examine broader forms of collectivism for these workers, drawing on survey and interview data. Our focus is on social class, attitudes towards unions and professional bodies and participation in the broader ICT community - specifically Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). The findings reveal absence of formal collective frames of reference or organisation, yet the creativity, autonomy and initiative, central to the identity of ICT workers, may offer opportunities for collectivisation particularly when we look at participation in FLOSS communities.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Chemical analysis of multicellular tumour spheroids  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/6794","Jamieson, L.E.; Harrison, David James; Campbell, C.J.","June 2015","Conventional two dimensional (2D) monolayer cell culture has been considered the ‘gold standard’ technique for in vitro cellular experiments. However, the need for a model that better mimics the three dimensional (3D) architecture of tissue in vivo has led to the development of Multicellular Tumour Spheroids (MTS) as a 3D tissue culture model. To some extent MTS mimic the environment of in vivo tumours where, for example, oxygen and nutrient gradients develop, protein expression changes and cells form a spherical structure with regions of proliferation, senescence and necrosis. This review focuses on the development of techniques for chemical analysis of MTS as a tool for understanding in vivo tumours and a platform for more effective drug and therapy discovery. While traditional monolayer techniques can be translated to 3D models, these often fail to provide the desired spatial resolution and z-penetration for live cell imaging. More recently developed techniques for overcoming these problems will be discussed with particular reference to advances in instrument technology for achieving the increased spatial resolution and imaging depth required.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Technology development for the early detection of plant pests : a framework for assessing Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) in environmental science  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/25554","White, Rehema; Marzano, Mariella; Fesenko, Elena; Inman, Alan; Jones, Glyn; Agstner, Barbara; Mumford, Rick","June 2022","Innovation in environmental fields such as plant health is complex because of unbounded challenges and lack of certainty of commercial uptake. In this paper we present a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) framework, specifically to assist with assessment of technologies to support detection of tree pests and pathogens, but also for wider potential adaptation. Biosecurity can be enhanced by improved early detection of pests and pathogens, but development and deployment of new technologies requires robust scrutiny. We critically analyse the concept, practice and applicability of TRLs. Interviews revealed scientist perspectives during the development process of five novel early plant pest and pathogen detection technologies. A retrospective, collective narrative of one technology from concept to commercial deployment was undertaken. We then developed a calculator tool for assessment of biosecurity TRLs. Our findings illustrate the iterative process of technology development, the challenges in final TRLs of acquiring funding to move from proven success to viable product, inefficiencies created through the need for multiple projects for each technology and the imperative to consider the wider socio-ecological technical landscape, including policy context. End user engagement was particularly valuable at beginning and end of the TRL scale. We conclude that the TRL framework comprises a robust approach to assess technologies in that it facilitates progress tracking, evaluation of success likelihood and identification of opportunities for investment. However, its potential will only be realised for environmental management if it is integrated into the socio-ecological technical landscape and wider discussions regarding knowledge co-production and valuing nature.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

We argue that there is a lot of wishful thinking, but little empirically validated knowledge in this emerging field of study. We outline key developments and pay attention to larger societal and political trends. The aim of this special issue is: 1) To offer a critical state-of-the-art overview of empirical research; and 2) to explore whether social media and mobile technologies have measurable effects on citizens' engagement beyond traditional mobilization and participation tools. We find that wider engagement only ‘materializes’ if virtual connections also manifest themselves in real space through concrete actions, by using both online and offline engagement tools. Another requirement is that planners do not seek to marginalize dissenting voices in order to promote the interests of powerful developers.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Looking inside the spiky bits : a critical review and conceptualisation of entrepreneurial ecosystems  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/10785","Brown, Ross Crawford; Mason, Colin","June 2017","The concept of entrepreneurial ecosystems has quickly established itself as one of the latest ‘fads’ in entrepreneurship research. At face value, this kind of systemic approach to entrepreneurship offers a new and distinctive path for scholars and policy makers to help understand and foster growth-oriented entrepreneurship. However, its lack of specification and conceptual limitations has undoubtedly hindered our understanding of these complex organisms. Indeed, the rapid adoption of the concept has tended to overlook the heterogeneous nature of ecosystems. This paper provides a critical review and conceptualisation of the ecosystems concept: it unpacks the dynamics of the concept; outlines its theoretical limitations; measurement approaches and use in policy-making. It sets out a preliminary taxonomy of different archetypal ecosystems. The paper concludes that entrepreneurial ecosystems are a highly variegated, multi-actor and multi-scalar phenomenon, requiring bespoke policy interventions.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Killer whales in Iceland and Norway exhibit similar ecology and behavior, are genetically related, and are presumed to have been in contact before the collapse of the Atlanto-Scandian herring stock in the 1960s. However, photo-identification suggests no recent movements between Iceland and Norway but regular movement between Iceland and Shetland. Acoustic recordings collected between 2005 and 2016 in Iceland, Norway, and Shetland were used to undertake a comprehensive comparison of call repertoires of Northeast Atlantic killer whales. Measurements of time and frequency parameters of calls from Iceland (n = 4,037) and Norway (n = 1,715) largely overlapped in distribution, and a discriminant function analysis had low correct classification rate. No call type matches were confirmed between Iceland and Norway or Shetland and Norway. Three call types matched between Iceland and Shetland. Therefore, this study suggests overall similarities in time and frequency parameters but some divergence in call type repertoires. This argues against presumed past contact between Icelandic and Norwegian killer whales and suggests that they may not have been one completely mixed population.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Sustainable strategic investment decision-making practices in UK companies : the influence of governance mechanisms on synergy between industry 4.0 and circular economy  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/29657","Alkaraan, Fadi; Elmarzouky, Mahmoud; Hussainey, Khaled; Venkatesh, VG","February 2023","Prior studies articulate the growing synergy between Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies and CE techniques. However, the literature lacks empirical evidence regarding boardrooms' commitment to implementing these technological domains through sustainable strategic investment decision-making practices (SSIDMP). This paper uses computer-aided textual analysis to explore the current trend of SSIDMP in UK companies. Our debate draws on data from UK companies, FTSEE ALL Share, over the period (2012−2021). We develop proxies for I4.0 technologies and CE techniques to examine the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques and the influence of this synergy on companies' financial performance. The findings reveal the vital role the organizational ambidexterity plays in the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques through exploring and exploiting technological techniques and mechanisms to cope with changing business environment. Our empirical study explores the impact of governance mechanisms on the relationships between SSIDMP, I4.0 technologies, CE techniques, and companies' financial performance. Findings support that synergy between these two domains is the key determinant of sustainable value creation and sustainable organizational performance. The synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques significantly impact SSIDMP and companies' financial performance, though the level of the synergy varies according to industry sectors. Furthermore, our analysis shows that governance mechanisms (ESG, board compositions, risk management, internal audit) strengthen the relationships between these two domains and companies' performance.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

To address this problem, we propose using flexible organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) as light sources for photodynamic therapy (PDT) to kill bacteria. PDT involves the use of light and a photosensitizer to generate reactive oxygen species that kill neighbouring cells. We have developed flexible top-emitting flexible OLEDs with the ability to tune the emission peak from 669-737 nm to match the photosensitizer, together with high irradiance, low driving voltage, long operational lifetime and adequate shelflife. These features enable OLEDs to be the ideal candidate for ambulatory PDT light sources. A detailed study of OLED-PDT for killing S. aureus was performed. The results show that our OLEDs in combination with the photosensitizer methylene blue can kill more than 99% of bacteria, which indicates a huge potential for using OLEDs to treat bacterial infections.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

We present Demystify, a tool which allows puzzles to be expressed in a high-level constraint programming language and uses MUSes to allow us to produce descriptions of steps in the puzzle solving. We give several improvements to the existing techniques for solving puzzles with MUSes, which allow us to solve a range of significantly more complex puzzles and give higher quality explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of Demystify by comparing its results to documented strategies for solving a range of pen and paper puzzles by hand, showing that our technique can find many of the same explanations.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

This assertion is true for coastal states and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on the African continent, where limited maritime enforcement capabilities have increased security threats at sea, such as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, piracy and armed robbery at sea, toxic waste dumping and other illicit activities. African navies and their foreign partners are taking advantage of the opportunities that technology provides to improve safety and security. Technology has led to the identification of criminals at sea, their capture and prosecution, making it crucial in enhancing maritime security. As such, the merits of its use for maritime security are undeniable. However, using technology comes with challenges that need to be considered. With this in mind, our research makes an original contribution by exploring the opportunities for using technology to advance maritime safety and security in Africa, successes and challenges with an emphasis on the Gulf of Guinea region. Drawing from questionnaire data from maritime law enforcement personnel, agencies supporting the implementation of the Yaoundé Code of Conduct (2013), and a review of relevant literature and policy documents, we contend that technology has significantly improved maritime domain awareness and the effective implementation of maritime safety and security in the Gulf of Guinea.

Monitoring of landslides is therefore essential in order to understand and possibly predict their behavior and potential danger. Terrestrial laser scanning has proven to be a successful tool in the assessment of changes on landslide surfaces due to its high resolution and accuracy. However, it is necessary to classify the 3D point clouds into vegetation and bare-earth points using filtering algorithms so that changes caused by landslide activity can be quantified. For this study, three classification algorithms are compared on an exemplary landslide study site in the Oetz valley in Tyrol, Austria. An optimal set of parameters is derived for each algorithm and their performances are evaluated using different metrics. The volume changes on the study site between the years 2017 and 2019 are compared after the application of each algorithm. The results show that (i) the tested filter techniques perform differently, (ii) their performance depends on their parameterization and (iii) the best-performing parameterization found over the vegetated test area will yield misclassifications on non-vegetated rough terrain. In particular, if only small changes have occurred the choice of the filtering technique and its parameterization play an important role in estimating volume changes.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

In this study, the structure of phosphor has been modified through cation substitution to induce charge variation and a rearrangement of neighboring nitride clusters, and consequently enhance its luminescent behavior. Substitution of Ca2+ by Sr2+ cations expanded the lattice volume and the b-c plane, but shortened the distance between the layers along the a axis. Lattice distortion of the framework introduced high-coordination sites in the Sr/Eu centers and adequate space, thereby facilitating charge variation of activators under reduced atmosphere, as detected through X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. As such, the photoluminescent intensity of the phosphors increased by more than 10% and a blue shift occurred. The microstructures of the samples were also analyzed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Cation substitution induced a special change in the anion environment, as indicated in the solid-state Raman spectra. Moreover, a typical ordering variations in the SiN4 and AlN4 clusters are generated in the lattice. Meanwhile, neighbor sequence of (Si/Al)N4 around the divalent centers were observed through solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The modified ordering distribution resulted in a rigid structure and improved the thermal quenching behavior. Thermal stability has been enhanced by 10% at 473 K when x = 0.9 in SrxCa0.993-xAlSiN3:Eu2+0.007 compared with that at x = 0.

It does so by providing a critique of the “mission-oriented” approach espoused for the new Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB). The central contention put forward in this paper is that its mission-oriented approach constitutes “fuzzy” policy making which is highly opaque, lacking sufficient detail and fails to align itself properly with the demand conditions within the Scottish innovation system. Arguably, this policy approach could result in significant policy path dependencies which could further reinforce (rather than reverse) the inherent weaknesses within the Scottish innovation system. The paper outlines an alternative “diffusion-oriented” approach which seems better equipped at overcoming the entrenched “low productivity, low innovation equilibrium” evident in Scotland. Regional innovation policy must be properly customised to ensure new agencies are effectively tailored and aligned to the demand conditions within their local innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. In short, policy should be context-led rather than mission-led.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Moreover, the micro-Doppler signature varies depending on the shape of individual UAV components such that these signatures can be used to differentiate between different UAV models. In order to investigate how different UAV components affect the signature, a high-fidelity micro-Doppler simulation has been developed previously, capable of generating micro-Doppler returns from 3D CAD models. This simulation requires experimental validation and so a 94 GHz radar has been designed and built for lab-based micro-Doppler measurements of UAV components in CW or FMCW Doppler modes. This allows for controlled experimental recreations of simulated scenarios in which the experimental micro-Doppler signatures of different UAV components can be measured and used for robust simulation validation. In this paper, the radar design will be explained in detail and the radar performance will be reviewed. Chirps are generated around 1 GHz using an Analog Devices AD9914 DDS board and upconverted onto a low phase noise STALO at 6.833 GHz. The upper sideband is filtered and frequency multiplied by 12 to 94 GHz. In FMCW mode the maximum chirp bandwidth is 3 GHz. The receiver is homodyne using a 94 GHz I-Q mixer to de-chirp to baseband.

"A non-technical overview of spatially explicit capture-recapture models  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/3259","Borchers, David","February 2012","Most capture-recapture studies are inherently spatial in nature, with capture probabilities depending on the location of traps relative to animals. The spatial component of the studies has until recently, however, not been incorporated in statistical capture-recapture models. This paper reviews capture-recapture models that do include an explicit spatial component. This is done in a non-technical way, omitting much of the algebraic detail and focussing on the model formulation rather than on the estimation methods (which include inverse prediction, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods). One can view spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models as an endpoint of a series of spatial sampling models, starting with circular plot survey models and moving through conventional distance sampling models, with and without measurement errors, through mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models. This paper attempts a synthesis of these models in what I hope is a style accessible to non-specialists, placing SECR models in the context of other spatial sampling models.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Self-calibrated flexible holographic curvature sensor  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/29262","Xiao, Jianling; Plaskocinski, Tomasz Tytus; Biabanifard Hossein Abadi, Mohammad; Di Falco, Andrea","February 2024","Optical curvature sensors find regular use in deformation analysis, typically requiring pre-calibration and post-processing of the gathered data. In this work, a self-calibrated curvature sensor based on flexible holographic metasurfaces operating in the visible range is presented. In contrast to existing solutions, the sensor can be fabricated independently from the target objects and provides an immediate readout of their curvature. The sensor consists of distinct patterned areas that create images of a reference scale and of a position indicator, which shift with respect to each other, as the metasurface is deformed. The results of this sensor are validated with an external calibration and critically discuss the types of deformations that the sensor can detect. This feature makes the sensor particularly attractive for applications where real-time curvature monitoring is essential, such as in robotics, biomechanics, and structural health monitoring.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Entrepreneurial ecosystems and public policy in action : a critique of the latest industrial policy blockbuster  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/23867","Brown, Ross; Mawson, Suzanne","August 2019","Efforts to develop entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) have proliferated in recent years, marking it out as the latest industrial policy ‘blockbuster’. This paper reports the findings from a comprehensive empirical analysis of policy approaches deployed under this conceptual umbrella, enabling us to posit a basic typology of different EE policy frameworks. The findings suggest the concept is fraught with conceptual ambiguity and is predominantly (and rather crudely) used to promote ‘more’ entrepreneurship. The research suggests the concept is a “messy metaphor” open to wide-ranging misinterpretation and misuse by policy makers. Eradicating network failures, avoiding crude policy isomorphism and tailoring bespoke interventions are suggested policy recommendations.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Additionally in a post Bin Laden world and with the immanent withdrawal of coalition combat troops from Afghanistan, there is the possibility of Africa as a continent becoming the new front in the Global War on Terror (Mben et al., 2013). However, it is a mistake to assume that Africa’s story is uniformly one of violence and death. Vibrant cultures and a rugged entrepreneurial spirit have combined with a robust Internet backbone, to create the embryonic emergence of high tech hotspots across Africa. With rising IT literacy levels, more and more Africans are becoming connected to the information super highway on a daily basis (Graham, 2010).

"The epidemiology of Phytophthora ramorum and P. kernoviae at two outbreak sites in Scotland  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/4515","Elliot, Matthew","September 2013","This PhD examined the epidemiology of two potentially devastating plant pathogens, Phytophthora ramorum and P. kernoviae, at Benmore Botanic Garden in Argyll & Bute and Brodick Castle Garden in Arran. Spore traps, river baiting, bait plants and soil sampling were used to both confirm the presence of, and measure the amount of inoculum in the environment in order to quantify the relationship between inoculum levels and disease development. P. ramorum was detected in spore traps at high levels under a sporulating host throughout the year at Benmore. Also, findings at sites where infected hosts had been removed before the study led to the conclusion that the low level spore traps detect inoculum from soil splash. Rhododendron and Vaccinium bait plants were also infected with P. ramorum via soil splash at sites within Benmore where there was no sporulating host present. P. kernoviae was detected in spore traps at Brodick throughout the year but only where there was a sporulating host overhead. P. kernoviae infected bait plants only where an infected host is overhead. Water baiting confirmed the presence of P. ramorum in two streams at Benmore but P. kernoviae was not detected using this method despite the large-scale P. kernoviae infection at Brodick. Inoculum continued to be detected in soil in areas of both gardens where infected hosts had been removed two years previously, confirming that both of these pathogens can survive in soil for a considerable period. A number of statistical models were produced to describe conditions required for P. ramorum sporulation and infection. Sporulation occurred during warmer and wetter conditions and infection of bait plants occurred in wet conditions and where an infected host is in close proximity. A statistical model was also used to produce a P. ramorum risk map, uniquely at the garden scale, to enable garden managers at Benmore to visualise the areas most at risk within their garden. The findings of this study have clear management implications for the control of disease establishment and spread within the garden setting.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Three experiments tested three tasks: reading values, comparing values, and finding extrema. The results provide the first empirical comparisons of color scales with symbol-based techniques. The interactive tooltip enabled higher accuracy and shorter times than the color scales for reading values but showed slow completion times and low accuracy for value comparison and extrema finding tasks.

Andrew; Hare, Matthew P.; Madden, Sean","June 2018","Monitoring indicator species is a pragmatic approach to natural resource assessments, especially when the link between the indicator species and ecosystem state is well justified. However, conducting ecosystem assessments over representative spatial scales that are insensitive to local heterogeneity is challenging. We examine the link between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination and population density of an aquatic habitat specialist over a large spatial scale using non-invasive genetic spatial capture-recapture. Using American mink (Neovison vison), a predatory mammal and an indicator of aquatic ecosystems, we compared estimates of density in two major river systems, one with extremely high levels of PCB contamination (Hudson River), and a hydrologically independent river with lower PCB levels (Mohawk River). Our work supports the hypothesis that mink densities are substantially (1.64-1.67 times) lower in the contaminated river system. We demonstrate the value of coupling the indicator species concept with well-conceived and spatially representative monitoring protocols. PCBs have demonstrable detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, including mink, and these effects are likely to be profound and long-lasting, manifesting as population-level impacts. Through integrating non-invasive data collection, genetic analysis, and spatial capture-recapture methods, we present a monitoring framework for generating robust density estimates across large spatial scales.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Post-trafficking bordering practices : perverse co-production, marking and stretching borders  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/10340","Laurie, Nina; Richardson, Diane; Poudel, Meena; Townsend, Janet","September 2015","This paper highlights the significance of post-trafficking scenarios for understanding bordering practices in political geography. In so doing, it addresses two significant research gaps: the lack of attention to trafficking in geography and the failure of wider interdisciplinary debates to engage with post-trafficking specifically. While extensive research in political geography has addressed the related experiences of refugees, asylum seekers and 'illegals', much of this work has centred on policies, processes and practices that aim to keep 'unwanted strangers out'. By contrast, very little research has addressed how the border is configured for and by those who are crossing-back over; those who are 'returning home', in this case from diverse trafficking situations. The paper draws on recent empirical research on post-trafficking citizenship and livelihoods in Nepal which examined how women returning from trafficking situations deal with stigma and marginalisation. Our analysis illuminates how bordering practices circumscribe and shape women's lives in powerful ways as they seek to (re)establish a sense of belonging and respect. We examine the interplay of state and non-state actors (national and transnational) in structuring mobility and anti-trafficking advocacy through a range of bordering practices and explore how the border is (co-)produced by varied actors at different border sites. This includes women returning from diverse trafficking situations, who invoke the border to argue that they are 'not as trafficked' as other women, and others who perform the border differently as agents for trafficking prevention.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

However, it remains unclear how the PRC’s different state actors justify this approach. Based on an analysis of the discourse and behaviour of the PRC’s state actors through strategic framing theory, their role as a privacy guardian can arguably be described as strategically constructed. The Chinese government and legislative bodies have tailored their communications to present themselves as champions of individual privacy, aiming to secure support for state policies. This strategic framing encompasses four mechanisms: the reframing of privacy threats through political narratives; legal ambiguities; selective framing; and the implementation of censorship to influence public discourse. An examination of how the Chinese government responded differently to data breaches in the cases of Didi and the Shanghai National Police Database leak highlights the Chinese government’s efforts in maintaining framing consistency to construct itself as a guardian, rather than a violator, of individual privacy.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

One key concern is the UK's apparent ?side-lining? of the law. A series of events were convened to investigate critical legal perspectives on the issues, culminating in an expert workshop addressing five sectors. Participants discussed AI in the context of wider trends towards automated decision-making (ADM). A recent proliferation in legal actions is expected to continue. The discussions illuminated the various ways in which individual examples connect systematically to developments in governance and broader 'AI-related decision-making', particularly due to chronic problems with transparency and awareness. This provides a fresh and current insight into the perspectives of key groups advancing criticisms relevant to policy in this area.

"Disruptive technologies for heritage preservation and promotion : strategies connecting heritage, community and museums through 3D digitisation  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/27580","Cassidy, Catherine Anne","June 2023","Heritage is the physical evidence of human existence and expression with resounding benefits to society and communities. However, an ever-changing world presents constant threats, risking heritage’s destruction or loss. 3D digitisation preserves physical heritage through its reconstitution to digital, augmenting the potential for dissemination within the digital domain. A disconnect between museums and emergent technologies presents a challenge for democratised 3D digitisation and management. Yet, museums and their communities are agents for transformation invested in heritage permanence, with digital literacies to suggest synergies with adapted 3D processes and engagement. An opportunity for intervention to support preservation of heritage through 3D digitisation while facilitating its promotion through engagement with emergent and immersive technologies is investigated in this thesis. Unexpectedly, COVID-19 caused major global disruption, threatening to destabilise connections to heritage and undermine functionalities of museums within their communities. Response to COVID-19 initiated innovation, leading to modified design for applicable stakeholder response. This dissertation investigates how application of accessible strategies empowers communities to actively engage with their heritage as 3D digital assets in a time of disruption. Practice-based research methodologies informed collaborative innovation with stakeholders and end users at various intersections of 3D preservation and promotion. Design of infrastructures and processes aid in engagement through laboratory research, deployed prototypes, and recognition of demands from COVID-19. Strategies for Preserving Heritage through Engagement Representation and Archiving (SPHERA) supports engagement with 3D assets through its Pillars, including creation of digital content, digital skills development and knowledge exchange, and infrastructures to facilitate digital heritage curation and engagement. Guiding Principles and best Practice workflows support implementation of SPHERA as part of original contributions for this dissertation. Leveraging emergent technologies for communities and museums to preserve and promote heritage improves engagement and accessibility with consequential social benefits and wellbeing, and is an area of potential for the future.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

This paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for four-port quasi-optical circulators with 60-dB isolation, 0.2-dB insertion loss, and better than 80-dB return loss for devices centered at 94 GHz. A method is presented for the accurate characterization of the complex permeability and permittivity of permanently magnetized ferrites via a series of frequency and polarization dependent transmission and reflection measurements. The dielectric and magnetic parameters for the sample are determined by fitting theoretical curves to the measured data. These fitted parameters are then used in a model for a complete quasi-optical Faraday rotator, including matching layers, allowing the accurate design and fabrication of these devices for any specific operational frequency band in the millimeter wave and sub-millimeter wave regime. Examples are given showing typical results and demonstrating how temperature cycling can significantly improve the temperature stability of these devices, while allowing fine tuning of the center frequency. We also indicate the performance possible at higher frequencies to above 1 THz and outline performance of truly planar isolators where lossy polarizer material is built into the Faraday rotator matching structure.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

This paper examines the reasons for its failure, which largely centred on the programme's inappropriate design. The findings suggest that greater recognition needs to be given to the specificities of local entrepreneurial ecosystems when designing, aligning and executing systemic innovation policy instruments. It is argued that paying greater attention to policy failures could potentially help innovation scholars better understand how innovation systems function.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Most have a significant physical presence outside of Scotland, thereby reducing their Scottish ‘footprint’ and domestic job creation. Scottish HGFs appear to have a high propensity to be acquired, increasing the susceptibility of the head office to closure.

While HFSE are commonly assumed to be immobile in hydrothermal systems, transport by late-stage hydrothermal fluids associated with alkaline magmas is reported. However, the magnitude of the flux and the conditions are poorly constrained and essential to understanding the formation of REE-HFSE ores. Here we examine the alteration of country rocks (‘fenitization’) accompanying the emplacement of a syenite magma at Illerfissalik in Greenland, through analysis of changes in rock chemistry, mineralogy and texture. Our novel geochemical maps show a 400 m wide intrusion aureole, within which we observe typically tenfold increases in the concentrations of many elements, including HFSE. Textures suggest both pervasive and structurally-hosted fluid flow, with initial reaction with the protolith’s quartz cement leading to increased permeability and enhancing chemical interaction with a mixed Ca-K-Na fenitizing fluid. We estimate the HFSE masses transferred from the syenite to the fenite by this fluid and find ~43 Mt of REE were mobilised (~12% of the syenite-fenite system TREO budget) – a mass comparable to the tonnages of some of the world’s largest HFSE resources. We argue that fenite can yield crucial information about the tipping points in magma evolution as retention or loss of volatile-bonded alkali and HFSE is key for development of magmatic zirconosilicate-hosted HFSE ores (i.e. Kringlerne, Ilimaussaq), or formation of the syenite-hosted Nb-Ta-REE (Motzfeldt-type) roof-zone deposits.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

Transnational entrepreneurs attracted to these programmes are highly focused on exploiting these networks whilst maintaining multiple levels of embeddedness in various contexts to maximise the opportunities afforded by accelerators. While many governments are attempting to replicate accelerators programmes within the public sector, the paper concludes that such attempts may prove problematic within weaker entrepreneurial ecosystems.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

The advantages of using microwaves instead of conventional DC sources to pump a laser are explained. These include the lower electrode and discharge tube wear due to the oscillating nature of a microwave electric field. The propagation of microwave radiation in an ionised gas is examined. At the frequencies used, the skin depth of an Argon ion laser discharge is shown to be approximately 1 mm, indicating good microwave power absorption. The dependence of the microwave power absorption on the frequency is shown to be weak. Microwave transmission at a dielectric/gas-discharge boundary, similar to those in the laser coupling structures used, is found to be around 1% of the incident power. It is suggested that for maximum laser efficiency, microwave power should be introduced directly into the gas discharge. Two microwave coupling structure designs for supplying microwave power to the laser discharges are described. The first of these, a waveguide coupler device based on the 3dB branch guide coupler, produces a transverse electric field across the laser tube. The procedure used to design a branch guide coupler using a Chebyshev impedance taper and T- junction discontinuity corrections is outlined, and a description of the entire laser coupling structure is given. The second design comprises a helix wrapped round the laser tube and produces an axial electric field. The electric field distribution around a helix is calculated as a function of helix parameters and the effects of surrounding objects are considered. The best helix dimensions are found for optimum laser operation. The characteristics of conventional Argon ion and Helium-Krypton ion lasers are given. No significant differences between conventional noble gas ion lasers and the microwave excited lasers reported here are observed. At the input powers used (~100 kW peak, 1 uS pulses, 1000 pps), 100 mW, 1 uS and 30 mW, 5 uS laser pulses are observed from Argon and Helium-Krypton gas mixtures, respectively.

"TiTAN: exploring midair text entry using freehand input  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/10661","Yeo, Hui Shyong; Phang, Xiao-Shen; Ha, Taejin; Woo, Woontack; Quigley, Aaron John","May 2017","TiTAN is a spatial user interface that enables freehand,midair text entry with a distant display while only requiring a low-cost depth sensor. Our system aims to leverage one’s familiarity with the QWERTY layout. It allows users to input text, in midair, by mimicking the typing action they typically perform on a physical keyboard or touchscreen. Here, both hands and ten fingers are individually tracked, along with click action detection which enables a wide variety of interactions.We propose three midair text entry techniques and evaluate the TiTAN system with two different sensors.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Optical trapping with superfocused high-M2 laser diode beam  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/6700","Sokolovskii, G. S.; Dudelev, V. V.; Melissinaki, V.; Losev, S. N.; Sobolev, K. K.; Deryagin, A. G.; Kuchinskii, V. I.; Farsari, M.; Sibbett, W.; Rafailov, E. U.","March 2015","Many applications of high-power laser diodes demand tight focusing. This is often not possible due to the multimode nature of semiconductor laser radiation possessing beam propagation parameter M2 values in double-digits. We propose a method of 'interference' superfocusing of high-M2 diode laser beams with a technique developed for the generation of Bessel beams based on the employment of an axicon fabricated on the tip of a 100 μm diameter optical fiber with highprecision direct laser writing. Using axicons with apex angle 1400 and rounded tip area as small as similar to 10 μm diameter, we demonstrate 2-4 μm diameter focused laser ` needle' beams with approximately 20 mu m propagation length generated from multimode diode laser with beam propagation parameter M2= 18 and emission wavelength of 960 nm. This is a few-fold reduction compared to the minimal focal spot size of ∼11 μm that could be achieved if focused by an 'ideal' lens of unity numerical aperture. The same technique using a 1600 axicon allowed us to demonstrate few-μm-wide laser 'needle' beams with nearly 100 μm propagation length with which to demonstrate optical trapping of 5-6μm rat blood red cells in a water-heparin solution. Our results indicate the good potential of superfocused diode laser beams for applications relating to optical trapping and manipulation of microscopic objects including living biological objects with aspirations towards subsequent novel lab-on-chip configurations.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Labor market returns to college major specificity  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/10982","Leighton, Margaret; Speer, Jamin","December 2017","This paper defines and measures college major specificity and estimates its labor market return over a worker’s life cycle. After reviewing other measures which have been used to measure specialization, we propose a novel approach grounded in human capital theory: a Gini coefficient based on the transferability of skills across occupations. We calculate and compare representative measures using data from the American Community Survey and the Baccalaureate and Beyond. We then use these measures to estimate the return to specialized higher education. Using our new measure, we find that the most ""specific"" majors clearly pay off the most over time. The initial annual earnings premium for the most specific majors is 8%, all of which comes through wages and not hours worked. This premium declines with age but is positive at most ages. We then apply our measure to the question of entrepreneurs and managers. Despite enjoying higher average earnings, graduates from specific majors are 20-25% less likely than average majors to become entrepreneurs or hold managerial positions, while the most general majors lead to the highest rates of entrepreneurship. This finding lends support to a prominent hypothesis from the literature on managers and entrepreneurs.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

"Between Flows and Places : Using Geodemographics to Explore EU Migration Across Neighbourhoods in Britain  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/8477","Sabater, Albert","May 2015","During the past decade, the growing significance of EU migrants in Britain has attracted considerable media and policy attention. While the rhetoric and public policy debate has focused on national and regional levels, surprisingly, little is known about the emerging settlement patterns of EU migrants at the local level. This paper sheds some light on this important issue by exploring the socio-spatial characteristics of the places of destination/residence of EU migrants and, in doing so, reveals the extent to which the concentration-dispersal framework applies to their settlement pattern. To evaluate whether and in what ways EU migrants have settled across neighbourhoods in Britain, 2001 and 2011 census estimates as well as geodemographic data are used. The findings suggest that EU migrants have consolidated their national presence in Britain because of their growing numbers and unprecedented geographical dispersal. While EU migrants’ settlement does not seem to translate into strong clustering patterns, diverging socio-spatial experiences are found among the largest groups (Polish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish).","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"Robust estimation of bacterial cell count from optical density  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/20971","iGEM Interlab Study Contributors; Melo Czekster, Clarissa; Powis, Simon John","September 2020","Optical density (OD) is widely used to estimate the density of cells in liquid culture, but cannot be compared between instruments without a standardized calibration protocol and is challenging to relate to actual cell count. We address this with an interlaboratory study comparing three simple, low-cost, and highly accessible OD calibration protocols across 244 laboratories, applied to eight strains of constitutive GFP-expressing E. coli. Based on our results, we recommend calibrating OD to estimated cell count using serial dilution of silica microspheres, which produces highly precise calibration (95.5% of residuals  <1.2-fold), is easily assessed for quality control, also assesses instrument effective linear range, and can be combined with fluorescence calibration to obtain units of Molecules of Equivalent Fluorescein (MEFL) per cell, allowing direct comparison and data fusion with flow cytometry measurements: in our study, fluorescence per cell measurements showed only a 1.07-fold mean difference between plate reader and flow cytometry data.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

"Measuring QoS in Web-Based Virtual Worlds : an evaluation of Unity 3D web builds  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/8764","Bakri, Hussein; Allison, Colin","May 2016","Web Based Virtual Worlds (WBVW) provide users with an immersive 3D experience through their regular browser. They can be seen as prototypes for the 3D Web. This paper uses key Quality of Service metrics to compare and present measurements of two major formats for WBVW – Unity Web Player and WebGL. Significantly, in terms of realizing the 3D Web, the former requires a plug-in whereas the latter is now directly supported by major browsers. Metrics include Frames per Second, Frame Time, CPU usage, GPU usage, memory usage and Initial Download Time. The WBVW used in these experiments is Timespan Longhouse, a virtual world hosted originally in OpenSim and then transformed into Unity 3D and WebGL. The ability to transform virtual worlds built in OpenSim/Second Life to Unity 3D and then to the web has great potential to bring 3D immersive interaction capabilities to all web users but our results show that there is a significant performance difference between Web Player (plug-in needed) and WebGL (no plug-in required), in terms of all the metrics listed above. This paper explores the performance characteristics of the respective formats and proposes possible optimizations to improve their performance.","Tech","University of St Andrews"

"Cementing Techniques In Knee Surgery (CeTIKS) : a UK expert consensus study  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/29607","Hampton, Matthew; Balachandar, Vivek; Charalambous, Charalambos P; Sutton, Paul M; Walmsley, Phillip Jonathan; CeTIKS study group","September 2023","AIMS: Aseptic loosening is the most common cause of failure following cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and has been linked to poor cementation technique. We aimed to develop a consensus on the optimal technique for component cementation in TKA. METHODS: A UK-based, three-round, online modified Delphi Expert Consensus Study was completed focusing on cementation technique in TKA. Experts were identified as having a minimum of five years' consultant experience in the NHS and fulfilling any one of the following criteria: a 'high volume' knee arthroplasty practice (> 150 TKAs per annum) as identified from the National joint Registry of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man; a senior author of at least five peer reviewed articles related to TKA in the previous five years; a surgeon who is named trainer for a post-certificate of comletion of training fellowship in TKA. RESULTS: In total, 81 experts (round 1) and 80 experts (round 2 and 3) completed the Delphi Study. Four domains with a total of 24 statements were identified. 100% consensus was reached within the cement preparation, pressurization, and cement curing domains. 90% consensus was reached within the cement application domain. Consensus was not reached with only one statement regarding the handling of cement during initial application to the tibial and/or femoral bone surfaces. CONCLUSION: The Cementing Techniques In Knee Surgery (CeTIKS) Delphi consensus study presents comprehensive recommendations on the optimal technique for component cementing in TKA. Expert opinion has a place in the hierarchy of evidence and, until better evidence is available these recommendations should be considered when cementing a TKA.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
"A meta systematic review of artificial intelligence in higher education : a call for increased ethics, collaboration, and rigour  ","https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/29192","Bond, Melissa; Khosravi, Hassan; De Laat, Maarten; Bergdahl, Nina; Negrea, Violeta; Oxley, Emily; Pham, Phuong; Chong , Sin Wang; Siemens, George","January 2024","Although the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has a substantial history as a research domain, never before has the rapid evolution of AI applications in education sparked such prominent public discourse. Given the already rapidly growing AIEd literature base in higher education, now is the time to ensure that the field has a solid research and conceptual grounding. This review of reviews is the first comprehensive meta review to explore the scope and nature of AIEd in higher education (AIHEd) research, by synthesising secondary research (e.g., systematic reviews), indexed in the Web of Science, Scopus, ERIC, EBSCOHost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and ACM Digital Library, or captured through snowballing in OpenAlex, ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Reviews were included if they synthesised applications of AI solely in formal higher or continuing education, were published in English between 2018 and July 2023, were journal articles or full conference papers, and if they had a method section 66 publications were included for data extraction and synthesis in EPPI Reviewer, which were predominantly systematic reviews (66.7%), published by authors from North America (27.3%), conducted in teams (89.4%) in mostly domestic-only collaborations (71.2%). Findings show that these reviews mostly focused on AIHEd generally (47.0%) or Profiling and Prediction (28.8%) as thematic foci, however key findings indicated a predominance of the use of Adaptive Systems and Personalisation in higher education. Research gaps identified suggest a need for greater ethical, methodological, and contextual considerations within future research, alongside interdisciplinary approaches to AIHEd application. Suggestions are provided to guide future primary and secondary research.","Tech","University of St Andrews"
