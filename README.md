## CoLab ConTACT Data Collection Projects

This repository contains a collection of data acquisition projects aimed at gathering university research materials to centralise and streamline fragmented research into Communities of Practice.

The process aggregates relevant research from multiple university repositories into dynamically generated databases based on user-specified keywords. This repository holds the backend code responsible for data collection, which can be integrated with a front-end webpage for a seamless user experience.
